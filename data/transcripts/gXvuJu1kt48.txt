[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.120]   Today, we are discussing cannabis,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.480]   also referred to as marijuana.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.880]   Cannabis includes many different compounds
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.960]   that have profound impact on the brain and body.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.720]   So while many of you have probably heard of THC,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.880]   there are also compounds in cannabis
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.640]   such as CBD, and of course there are different types
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.300]   or strains of cannabis, including sativa strains
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.200]   and indica strains and hybrid strains.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.040]   And believe it or not,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.900]   nowadays there is also an entire literature,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.960]   meaning a scientific and medicinal literature
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.160]   about type one, type two, and type three strains.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.000]   I'll explain what all of that is and how they work.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.240]   I'll talk about some of the medicinal applications
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.720]   of different strains of cannabis
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.840]   and combinations of cannabis strains,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560]   as well as some of the potential health hazards
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.240]   of cannabis use.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.400]   I want to emphasize that any discussion about cannabis
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.160]   has to be framed within the context
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.000]   that the legality of cannabis varies tremendously
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.460]   depending on where you are in the world.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120]   So depending on which country you're in
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   and even which state you're in
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.760]   or which area within a country,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.400]   possessing and using and certainly selling cannabis
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.440]   can be either highly illegal or entirely legal
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.240]   or decriminalized or largely overlooked.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.400]   You of course are obligated to know
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.760]   what those local laws are for you,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.000]   where you live and where you travel.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.600]   With that said, today's discussion really will include
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.080]   a full picture as to where cannabis
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.780]   and the various and even very specific compounds
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200]   within cannabis can be extremely useful
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.160]   in the treatment of some ailments
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   and where certain compounds in cannabis
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.200]   can be extremely dangerous for certain individuals to use,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   in particular individuals that have pre-existing
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.180]   genetic propensity for psychosis.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.900]   That theme is going to come up again and again,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.400]   but we are also going to talk about the role of cannabis
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.720]   in anxiety, in depression,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.420]   both positive and negative effects.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.660]   We'll talk about sex differences
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.120]   in terms of women versus men
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.920]   and how they react differently to cannabis.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.500]   And I would be entirely remiss
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.480]   if I didn't include a conversation about cannabis,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.800]   meaning THC, CBD, hybrid strains, et cetera,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.440]   in creativity and different modes of thinking.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.580]   Because as many of you probably know
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.540]   or at least have heard about,
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.240]   cannabis can impact the way that we think,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   the types of memory systems we can access
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.340]   and what's called convergent and divergent thinking,
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.680]   which is one way of conceptualizing
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.820]   what is commonly referred to as creativity.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.240]   So today's discussion is going to include
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.420]   a lot of information,
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.920]   but I promise to make it clear and accessible to all of you,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   regardless of whether or not
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.320]   you have a background in biology or not.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.360]   And today's discussion will also be quite nuanced.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.120]   You'll find me routinely reading
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300]   directly from specific research papers,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.660]   something that of course we always do on this podcast.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.200]   But today I'm really going to dig into
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.420]   some of the finer points of the methodology in papers
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.800]   and some of the statistics that were used
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.640]   and the specific populations of people that were studied.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.880]   Because as it turns out,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.720]   there are instances that we will discuss
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.440]   in which the use of cannabis
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.160]   can be immensely beneficial to one group
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.480]   and yet can be entirely detrimental to another group,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   even at equivalent dosages
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.560]   and depending on a number of different factors.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.760]   So we will discuss what those factors are.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   Just to give you a brief overview
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   of the kind of structure I'm going to put on today's episode,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.400]   we will review, of course, cannabis and its various forms.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.520]   I'll talk about some of the biology,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.120]   but we are going to really drill into how dosage,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.880]   that is the concentration of THC relative to CBD,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.640]   impacts whether or not cannabis
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.080]   is going to have one effect or another.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.280]   We will also talk about the frequency of use,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.040]   daily use, multiple times per day use,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.480]   weekly use or monthly or occasional use.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.600]   We will also talk about different professions
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   and how some people may have a little bit more leeway
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.560]   in terms of whether or not they decide to use cannabis
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.280]   or any of its various component chemical constituents,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.920]   that is CBD or THC, et cetera.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.680]   And for other professions,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.280]   it might be entirely inappropriate
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.600]   because of the particular kinds of cognitive tasks
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.080]   those professions demand.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.680]   We will also talk about genetic predisposition,
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   again, sex differences, hormone effects.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.860]   And I will also touch on
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.200]   what I think is the most important variable
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.580]   in determining whether or not cannabis
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.920]   is right or wrong for you.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.160]   And that is your age at which you are considering
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.200]   starting or continuing use or ceasing use.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   What I can assure you is that by the end of today's podcast,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.360]   you will have a quite thorough understanding of cannabis,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.080]   how it works, what it does,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.920]   what its potential benefits can be,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.000]   what its potential hazards are,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.800]   and whether or not it's right for you
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.960]   and the people that you know.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.040]   I'm excited to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.920]   has now launched a premium channel.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.780]   The purpose of the premium channel is several fold.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.480]   First of all, I will be hosting regular AMAs,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.760]   Ask Me Anythings, where you can ask me anything,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.680]   and I will provide answers in depth
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.440]   to your specific questions about science
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.680]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.440]   physical health, and performance.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.740]   Now, there is a nominal cost to the premium channel.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.880]   It's $10 per month, or you can pay $100 for the entire year.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.160]   I should mention, however,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.800]   that a significant portion of the funds
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   raised through the premium channel
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.840]   are going to support not just the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.480]   which we will continue to release every Monday on schedule,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.460]   of zero cost to all consumers,
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.360]   content on mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   but proceeds from the premium channel
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.840]   will also be used to fund research,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.900]   in particular, research done on human beings,
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.960]   so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.760]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.960]   that we are most interested in,
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   and we are going to specifically fund research
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.580]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.620]   for mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.520]   and those protocols will be distributed
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.940]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.780]   but through all channels,
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.940]   Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.520]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.720]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.900]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.560]   the kind of research that provides
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.640]   those kinds of answers in the first place.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.980]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.940]   is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.560]   to do a dollar-for-dollar match
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.220]   on all funds raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.840]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.800]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.840]   to further support research for science
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.640]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.160]   physical health, and performance.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.000]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.760]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.820]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.580]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.920]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.800]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.400]   and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.780]   that other people ask as well.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.720]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.540]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.440]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.980]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.760]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.420]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.300]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.540]   Before diving into all of that,
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.280]   I'd like to highlight a new,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.120]   what I think is very useful and zero-cost resource.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.580]   This resource is what's called non-sleep deep rest,
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.700]   or NSDR protocol.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.960]   I've talked many times before on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   about non-sleep deep rest, AKA NSDR.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.100]   NSDR is sort of an umbrella term
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.660]   for a variety of different practices.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.180]   So these are behavioral practices
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.500]   that allow you to direct your brain and body
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.960]   into a particular state.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.160]   And most typically, that state is one of deep relaxation,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.100]   but also one in which you can access
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.840]   your bodily and brain systems for teaching yourself
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.960]   how to relax in real time
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.620]   and how to recover some of the sleep
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.600]   that you may not be getting at night,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.200]   and to restore levels of dopamine
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.700]   in particular areas of the brain
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.060]   that are involved in motivation
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.960]   and cognitive and motor control.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.340]   Basically, NSDR is a wonderfully restorative tool.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.620]   This has been demonstrated many times over now
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.260]   through quality peer-reviewed science.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.960]   And there are neurochemical benefits
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.020]   and there are physical benefits,
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.540]   and there are certainly psychological benefits.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.420]   I highly recommend NSDR to anybody
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.660]   that has trouble falling asleep
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.060]   or that wakes up in the middle of the night
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.040]   and needs to get better at falling back asleep,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.560]   as well as to anyone out there
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.940]   that has issues with anxiety
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.720]   or sort of self-regulation of any kind.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.580]   And if you don't have any of those issues,
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.120]   it's also immensely beneficial just as a restorative
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.320]   for leaning back into focus work of any kind.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.680]   Now, a number of people have reached out
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.360]   about finding NSDR protocols,
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.200]   and there are a number of different good ones out there
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.100]   floating around.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.060]   I've decided to put a zero-cost NSDR script
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.020]   out there on the internet for people to access.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.740]   So you can find it by going to YouTube
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.440]   and simply put my last name, Huberman and NSDR,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.060]   into the search function.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.780]   This is a YouTube channel that's hosted by Virtusan,
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.100]   which has a terrific app that includes NSDR
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.700]   and a number of other health and wellness protocols.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.780]   But they've been quite generous
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.980]   in hosting a 10-minute NSDR read by me.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.960]   This NSDR is distinct from,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.260]   although I should say similar to Yoga Nidra,
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.380]   which some of you are familiar with.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.100]   This NSDR is different than Yoga Nidra
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.140]   in the sense that it doesn't have intentions.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.540]   There's no mystical component.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.760]   And I describe a little bit of the science
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.420]   and why specific components of the NSDR included,
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.020]   things like long exhale breathing.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.460]   I talk about perceptual shifts
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.660]   and how to move from thinking and planning
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.740]   to pure sensation.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.240]   If none of that makes sense right now,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.340]   it'll make total sense after listening to the NSDR script.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.020]   Again, it's a 10-minute NSDR script read by me.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.300]   You can do this first thing in the morning when you wake up,
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.460]   especially if you didn't get enough sleep that night
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.180]   and you're feeling a little bit fatigued
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.220]   and you need to lean into the day with full vigor.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.100]   You could do it at any point during the day,
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.420]   or if you wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.980]   Again, this is a zero-cost resource for you.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.300]   You can find it by going to YouTube,
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.640]   put my last name in, and NSDR.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.020]   I encourage you to try it.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.200]   And if you like it, or frankly, if you don't,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.800]   you can just put that in the comment section
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.880]   there on YouTube.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.580]   And I've put it there as a free resource to you
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.120]   so that you can benefit from the research-backed,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.180]   peer-reviewed studies that point to NSDR
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.460]   as a very useful practice.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.900]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.660]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.860]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.460]   to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.140]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.220]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.920]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.940]   Our first sponsor is Levels.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.520]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.980]   how different foods affect your health
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.100]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.620]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.940]   One of the most important factors
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.780]   in your immediate and long-term health
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.020]   is how well you're managing your blood glucose
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.060]   or blood sugar.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.860]   I started using Levels about a year ago
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.380]   as a way to see how different foods
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.380]   and different lifestyle factors
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.740]   were impacting my blood glucose levels.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.020]   So for instance, it allowed me to see how different foods
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.460]   and particular macronutrients
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.420]   and combinations of macronutrients
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.980]   would either peak or trough my blood sugar
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.060]   or keep my blood sugar steady.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.420]   It also allowed me to see how working out
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.340]   with weights or running, how that impacted my blood glucose.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.380]   So for me, it was a fascinating experiment
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.680]   unto myself as to how my meal schedule,
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.380]   the specific foods I was eating,
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.700]   different combinations of food, as I mentioned before,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.260]   and exercise were combining to regulate this thing
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.860]   that we call blood sugar and that's so vital to our health.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.560]   I think anyone that tries Levels
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.780]   will find that you learn an immense amount
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.700]   about what you're doing
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.220]   and what you ought to be doing differently
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.180]   in order to optimize your immediate feelings of wellbeing
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.700]   and your health trajectory.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.340]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.340]   and trying a CGM yourself, go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.120]   That's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.160]   Thesis makes custom nootropics
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.060]   that are designed for your particular needs.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.900]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.460]   because nootropics literally means smart drugs
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.780]   or smart drug.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.620]   And frankly, as a neuroscientist,
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.460]   I know and every other neuroscientist knows
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.360]   that there is no neural circuit or chemical in the brain
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.740]   for being smart.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.740]   There are, for instance, neural circuits and chemicals
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.780]   that increase your ability to focus
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.860]   or your ability to task switch.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.100]   Thesis understands this
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.540]   and therefore has designed custom nootropics
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.660]   that vary and are tailored to you
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.060]   so that, for instance, if you want to achieve focus
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.580]   and clarity for one particular type of work,
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.020]   there is a nootropic for that.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.940]   Or if you'd like to have more energy and have more focus,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.740]   there's a different nootropic for that.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.580]   If you'd like to get
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.220]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.520]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.620]   take that three-minute quiz,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.460]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.680]   to try in your first month,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.740]   and then they'll work with you
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.620]   and iterate to find the best formulas
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.820]   for you to take ongoing.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.540]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.500]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.700]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.660]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.180]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.820]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.420]   to help you better understand your body
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.420]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.220]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.120]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.180]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.860]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.500]   With a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.320]   an issue is you get information back
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.780]   about lipids and hormones, et cetera,
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.420]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.980]   With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.860]   that makes interpreting your data
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.580]   and then acting on that data very straightforward
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.340]   and very directed toward specific protocols.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.580]   What I mean by that is you'll get information back
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.060]   about hormone levels and metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.180]   and then you can look to nutritional changes,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.560]   supplementation changes, exercise protocol changes,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.900]   and other lifestyle features that combine
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.820]   or work on their own to try and shift those numbers
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.940]   into the range that's appropriate for you.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.320]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.060]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.300]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.820]   we talk about supplements.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.960]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.500]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.140]   Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep,
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.860]   or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability,
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.140]   or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.700]   to optimal range for you.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.440]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.780]   with Momentus Supplements.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.460]   We partnered with Momentus for a number of important reasons.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.900]   First of all, the quality of their ingredients
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.180]   is exceptional, it's really second to none.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.960]   Second of all, they ship internationally,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.020]   and that was important to us
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.780]   because a number of you reside outside of the United States.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.300]   Third, we've worked with Momentus very closely
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.720]   to develop single ingredient formulations.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.620]   Now, this turns out to be very important
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.820]   because if you're going to take supplements,
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.260]   you want to know what's working for you and what isn't.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.420]   And of course, you want to optimize the cost efficiency
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.460]   and the biological efficiency of those supplements.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.780]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.020]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.660]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.220]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.600]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.780]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.920]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.700]   Let's talk about cannabis.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.420]   And when we refer to cannabis,
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.560]   we are indeed referring to marijuana or the marijuana plant.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.220]   Now, cannabis plants come in different strains
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.280]   or different varieties, and those different strains
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.180]   are indeed different genetic strains.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.940]   So just as animals and humans
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.540]   have different genetic backgrounds
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.140]   and they can be crossed to one another
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.780]   to yield further genetic variation in the offspring,
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.620]   plants can be hybridized to one another in various ways
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.260]   through grafting or through the use
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.100]   of different types of seed combinations, et cetera,
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.240]   in order to generate different strains.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.820]   There are also naturally occurring differences
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.520]   in the strains of plants,
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.500]   and the cannabis plant is no exception.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.220]   So for instance, in the context of a discussion
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.500]   about cannabis and its medicinal uses and recreational uses,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.940]   we need to distinguish between the sativa variety,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.380]   the indica variety, a variety called ruderalis,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.120]   that's not often discussed,
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.940]   and hybrids of sativa, indica, and ruderalis.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.020]   Before diving into the different strains of cannabis
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.740]   and how they impact the brain and body both similarly
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.540]   and differently, I want to emphasize
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.140]   that the cannabis plant contains a number
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.220]   of different psychoactive compounds.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.980]   Now, the most powerful of those compounds is THC.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.980]   The technical name for it is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.940]   but THC, as I'll refer to it,
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.180]   is just one of the psychoactive
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.260]   and biologically active compounds within cannabis plants.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.500]   There's also CBD, which is technically referred
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.480]   to as cannabidiol, and cannabidiol, CBD,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.620]   is known to be used for things like pain management,
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.580]   anxiety management, and other medicinal purposes.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.060]   We will talk about the efficacy of CBD for those purposes,
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.820]   as well as some of, believe it or not,
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.520]   some of the dangers of CBD,
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.420]   depending on where it's sourced and the dosage, et cetera.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   So we've got THC, CBD, and also CBN, or cannabidiol.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.380]   CBN is less often discussed.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.620]   You're going to hear a lot less
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.780]   about CBN-containing products out there,
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.120]   CBN-containing medicines,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.840]   but it is relevant to today's discussion,
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.040]   so it will come up a bit.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.380]   Now, I will be sure to provide more specificity
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.440]   to what I'm about to say, but very broadly speaking,
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.620]   THC is largely responsible
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.140]   for the psychoactive effects of cannabis,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.540]   that is, the changes in mood,
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.660]   the changes in bodily state and sensation, et cetera,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.580]   whereas CBD, and to some extent CBN,
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.160]   have profound effects on the brain and body,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.380]   but they don't tend to give people the sensation
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.080]   of altered perception, altered mood, et cetera.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.960]   Some people might say they are not the component of cannabis
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.120]   that "gets you high,"
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.360]   although today we will really drill
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.660]   into what the high itself represents
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.360]   in terms of chemical systems in the brain and body,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.380]   and what we will soon learn is that what we think of
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.260]   as being high actually includes a number
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.820]   of different changes in the brain and body,
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.460]   some of which can be best explained by CBD, not by THC,
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.940]   which runs counter to what most people out there
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.380]   know and believe.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.880]   So broadly speaking, we have THC, CBD, and CBN,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.140]   but I want to point out that the cannabis plant
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.260]   has over 70, seven zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds,
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.100]   many of which still have not been studied
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.140]   in isolation and in detail.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.740]   So there's a big future of research for cannabis
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.340]   and for THC and THC-related psychoactive compounds,
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.760]   as well as for CBD and CBN.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.300]   Today we're mainly going to focus on THC and CBD,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.620]   as I mentioned before.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.300]   I should also point out that the cannabis plant
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.180]   has over 400 biologically active compounds.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.180]   So these are biologically active compounds
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.660]   that may or may not have psychoactive properties,
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.460]   that may or may not be useful for pain relief, et cetera.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.780]   Again, there is a vast landscape for exploration
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.700]   of the cannabis plant and of hemp for what they include
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.000]   that could be beneficial to us or detrimental to us.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.820]   So again, a lot more work to do.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.880]   Today, we're going to really try and stay on target
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.740]   with what we already know
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.380]   and where there are certain exciting mysteries
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.980]   or intriguing mysteries about what we ought to explore
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.100]   more, I will certainly highlight those.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.980]   Let's go back to the different strains of the cannabis plant,
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.220]   sativa, indica, and ruderalis,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.360]   and explore how each of those differentially impacts
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.860]   the brain and body, because therein I think we can start
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.540]   to learn a lot about this incredible plant
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.280]   that is the cannabis plant.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.120]   And whether or not you are a user of cannabis
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.460]   or whether or not you are entirely opposed to cannabis use,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.540]   understanding how cannabis works in the brain and body
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.060]   itself is absolutely fascinating and can teach you a lot
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.300]   about how your brain and body work at a basic level.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.580]   And can tell you a lot about how your brain and body
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.240]   will react to different life events
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.220]   and how your mood is established and stabilized
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.220]   and how your appetite is established and stabilized
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.180]   and so on.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.100]   So we have the three major strains of cannabis,
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.900]   sativa, indica, and ruderalis.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.680]   And for sake of today's conversation,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.000]   we can pretty much cross off ruderalis.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.120]   It's not often consumed and components of ruderalis
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.920]   are not often consumed for medicinal
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.360]   or recreational purposes.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.560]   Let's focus on sativa and indica.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.900]   People will consume the sativa variety of cannabis,
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.280]   either by edible or by smoking cannabis,
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.000]   or they will consume the indica variety of cannabis,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.360]   again, by edible or by smoking cannabis,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.340]   or sometimes they will take it in a transdermal form
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.360]   or a sublingual form.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.260]   There are a bunch of different ways to get the cannabis
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.420]   into the body, but there's a clear distinction
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.660]   between sativa and indica that actually shows up first
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.780]   in the structure of the plant.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.140]   At their extremes, meaning in a pure strain of sativa,
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.660]   it tends to be a taller plant, a longer stalk,
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.640]   believe it or not.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.440]   And actually the length of the leaves
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.780]   is quite a bit longer.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.020]   Whereas the indica plant tends to be more short and stout.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.860]   And for those aficionados out there,
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.860]   I'm sure you know a lot of the other specific features
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.280]   of sativa versus indica.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.340]   But already what we're talking about is the same plant,
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.280]   cannabis, with two very different morphologies or shapes.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.620]   You might say, well, why is this interesting
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.020]   or important to how it affects me or affects other people
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.800]   for medicinal recreational purposes?
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.720]   Well, it turns out that even though they are the same plant,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.660]   these two different genetic varieties,
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.700]   because of the way that they grow
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.300]   and the way they capture sunlight and the way,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.520]   believe it or not, that the different plants
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.780]   within that strain interact with one another,
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.920]   'cause believe it or not,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.940]   plants are interacting with one another,
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.900]   they actually bring different elements
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.300]   of the psychoactive compounds to different components
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.340]   within the leaves and the so-called buds.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.580]   The takeaway is that when consumed,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.460]   and when I say consumed, I want to be very clear,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.880]   I don't necessarily just mean oral consumption
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.060]   or eating cannabis sativa by edible.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.040]   I also mean smoking it, and that could be, you know,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.740]   people will, just like with tobacco,
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.240]   the way that they bring the psychoactive components
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.700]   into their bloodstream and into their brain and body
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.260]   is to essentially heat the dried leaves
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.580]   of the cannabis plant.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.720]   Then the heat liberates some of the psychoactive components
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.560]   that when inhaled into the lungs,
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.820]   because the lungs include a lot of vasculature,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.400]   a lot of basically blood vessels and capillaries,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.700]   that the psychoactive components
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.580]   are actually directly absorbed from the lungs
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.440]   into the bloodstream,
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.040]   and they can cross into the bloodstream
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.260]   and permeate throughout the body
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.240]   and cross the so-called blood-brain barrier.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.800]   So in other words, burning the plant liberates the smoke
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.640]   that contains the psychoactive compounds,
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.520]   and those are inhaled into the lungs
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.140]   and then get into the brain and body
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.620]   and act on the brain and body.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.220]   And the major effect of sativa varieties
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.940]   are to create a high, if you will,
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.980]   and I'm putting this in air quotes
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.440]   for those of you that are listening,
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.460]   but to also act as a stimulant.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.260]   The sativa varieties tend to make people
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.040]   feel kind of invigorated, somewhat alert.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   It doesn't tend to be as much of a sedative
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.720]   as some of the other varieties.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.140]   Some people report heightened sense of focus
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.680]   or heightened sense of creativity.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.880]   We will talk a little bit later on
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.820]   as to whether or not they actually are achieving
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.780]   heightened levels of focus and creativity,
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.460]   or whether or not they just perceive themselves
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.480]   to have heightened levels of focus and creativity.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.880]   The sativa varieties tend to make people
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.520]   feel a little bit less susceptible
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.780]   to pain and noxious stimuli,
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.900]   which are basically stimuli that you don't like.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.260]   So the sativa varieties are often prescribed
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.840]   or are used in the recreational context
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.200]   for pain management and relief.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.100]   Basically, the sativa variety is known to include
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.460]   a sort of head-biased effect.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.920]   So here we're talking about subjective effects,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.200]   and of course, these will vary
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.980]   from one individual to the next.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.020]   Some people will smoke cannabis sativa
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.280]   or ingest cannabis sativa orally
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.400]   and will feel an entirely different array of effects,
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.440]   but most people, the majority of people,
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.640]   experience a sort of head-centered high alertness focus
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.040]   and a sense that they're more creative.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.320]   Contrast that with the indica varieties of cannabis,
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.960]   and when people smoke or eat or ingest indica varieties,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.100]   the psychoactive components of indica,
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.620]   and again, this is pure indica,
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.480]   so not hybridized with sativa at all,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.800]   but just pure indica,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.040]   tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.340]   People report feeling more complete full-body relaxation,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.560]   more of a sedative effect.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.440]   Indica cannabis is often prescribed
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.120]   and/or used recreationally
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.840]   in order to achieve a state of sleep
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.780]   or to help relieve anxiety,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.440]   so less of a stimulant effect,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.960]   and we will talk about why,
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   literally the underlying neural circuits,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.760]   that lead to the sativa variety
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.880]   causing more of a elevated mood and a head high, if you will,
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.000]   and the indica varieties being more full-body relaxation.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.420]   One of the ways to remember the distinction
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.560]   between the effects of cannabis sativa and cannabis indica
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.160]   was relayed to me by a friend
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.540]   who actually was a chronic, meaning every day, all day,
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.800]   consumer of marijuana.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.680]   He basically smoked marijuana for 20 years
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.020]   before quitting about four or five years ago,
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.360]   and he said that indica is often referred to as indicouch,
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.860]   meaning laid back in the couch,
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.580]   and that can help you remember
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.020]   that the indica varieties of cannabis
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.860]   do tend to be more sedative in their effects.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.520]   Okay, so there's sativa and there's indica,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.780]   and then now there are hybrid strains.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.200]   So marijuana growers and people who specialize
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.020]   in creating novel varieties of the cannabis plant,
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.780]   again, I'm using the words cannabis and marijuana
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.000]   more or less interchangeably here,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.200]   they are very good at creating new strains of plant
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   that might be 25% sativa and 75% indica or vice versa,
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.080]   or 50/50 or 90/10.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.620]   Essentially what's happening nowadays
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.320]   is that through plant biology, plant genetics, I should say,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.960]   growers are getting quite efficient
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.560]   at creating a variety of different strains
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.840]   of the marijuana plant that give rise to very nuanced
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.040]   and distinct effects on brain and body.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.680]   In fact, so much so that there's now a new nomenclature,
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.540]   a new language emerging around cannabis
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.780]   and the development of novel strains of cannabis
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.780]   for medicinal and or recreational purposes.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.960]   And while this might sound a little bit medical
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.440]   or a little bit clinical to some people,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.140]   believe it or not, this is the nomenclature
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.500]   that it's now typically used.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.760]   People still refer to the sativa, indica, and hybrid strains,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.480]   but there's now also a description
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.240]   of so-called type one, type two, and type three strains
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.800]   for any given sativa, indica, or hybrid strain.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.200]   Okay, so just to put this clearly in your mind,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.440]   you've got sativa varieties, that is pure sativa varieties.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   You have indica varieties, again, pure indica,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.040]   and then you have hybrid varieties.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.280]   And beneath each of those, you have type one, type two,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   and type three strains of indica, sativa,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.140]   or hybrid varieties.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.340]   What are type one, type two, and type three?
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.420]   Well, type one, type two, and type three strains
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.760]   are strains that have varying amounts
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.320]   or ratios of THC to CBD.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.760]   So for instance, type one strain.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.160]   So for instance, you could have a pure sativa type one
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.200]   or a type one pure sativa or a type one indica.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.240]   Those are going to have the greatest amount
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.540]   of THC relative to CBD.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.240]   And I really want to emphasize this,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.520]   understanding the ratio of THC to CBD
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.380]   can help explain a lot or even predict a lot
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.740]   about how a given strain of cannabis will impact somebody.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.880]   For instance, because THC is largely responsible
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   for the typical psychoactive components of cannabis,
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.320]   so what I mean here is if somebody is ingesting sativa
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.640]   and it routinely makes them feel more energized,
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.820]   elevates their mood,
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.280]   gives them a heightened sense of creativity,
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.200]   if that's what they experience,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.680]   and they're taking a type one version of that,
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.500]   that means that it's quite rich in THC and very little CBD.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.280]   However, if they were to take a type one version of sativa
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.560]   and it feels far too strong, like too much energy,
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.480]   or they felt like they were too much in their head,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.080]   nowadays, there are strains of sativa
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.520]   that have been genetically engineered.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.680]   And I don't mean by an engineer tinkering away
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.600]   with gene engineering in a kind of crisper creating mutants,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.020]   but literally by hybridizing,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.140]   crossing different plants to one another, okay?
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.120]   Creating in a natural context,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.320]   the same way plants in the outside world
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.620]   would sometimes hybridize to one another.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.580]   Creating a variety that's perhaps type two,
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.580]   which is going to have less THC and more CBD,
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.480]   or a type three,
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.400]   which is going to be very high CBD and very little THC.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.480]   And the same is also true for the indica varieties.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.200]   So I want to make sure that everyone understands this
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   because it becomes very important
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.520]   for understanding the biology of cannabis
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   and predicting positive versus negative effects of cannabis.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.420]   Sativa has this kind of stimulant-like effect
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.600]   and tends to be more of a head high, if you will.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   Indica tends to be more full-bodied than lead
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.040]   to more in the couch, as I referred to it before,
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.240]   pun intended.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.020]   Deep relaxation, reduced insomnia, et cetera.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.680]   Now within each of those, sativa and indica,
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.220]   you have type one, type two, and type three.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.220]   And that has everything to do with how much THC,
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.660]   which is the dominant psychoactive compound versus CBD,
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.960]   which has other effects mainly on the body,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.300]   but not so much on the brain
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.080]   and modes of thinking and mood, et cetera.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.200]   How much THC versus CBD is present.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.080]   And again, type one is THC dominant,
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.380]   type two kind of equal ratios, if you will,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.800]   of THC and CBD, and type three tend to be high CBD.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.720]   Okay, so already we've got some categorization here
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.640]   that hopefully isn't overwhelming to you,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.100]   but this turns out to be extremely important
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.440]   if you want to understand how cannabis works
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.360]   and predict the effects of cannabis.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.880]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.800]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.260]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.620]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.520]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.200]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.420]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.020]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.100]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.080]   once or usually twice a day
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.000]   is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.680]   that I need for gut health.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.780]   Our gut is very important.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.340]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.100]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.500]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.140]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.000]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.820]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.380]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.300]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.180]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.640]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.080]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.480]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.760]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.060]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.360]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.760]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.440]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.820]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.760]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.280]   Okay, so somewhat surprisingly,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.680]   we're going to set aside cannabis.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.200]   We're going to take what we know about sativa, indica,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.600]   type 1, type 2, type 3, CBD, et cetera.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.640]   We're just going to set that aside for a moment.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.480]   Why would we do that?
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.600]   Well, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.480]   why would any of these plants,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.280]   why would any of these compounds, THC, CBD, sativa,
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.620]   indica, et cetera,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.640]   why would any of that have any effect on us at all?
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.720]   And this discussion that we're about to have
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.800]   very much resembles the discussion
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.480]   that we had on a previous episode about nicotine.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.000]   Because as many of you know,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.420]   nicotine is a commonly used substance.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.500]   In fact, if we were to look at
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.060]   the three most commonly used drugs,
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.600]   alcohol will be the top of the list.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.520]   Many billions of people regularly use alcohol
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.740]   or occasionally use alcohol.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.200]   Many billions of people also use nicotine.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.720]   It's the second most consumed drug.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   So more than 1 billion
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.080]   and probably closer to 2 billion people consume nicotine.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.480]   And then the third most consumed drug is cannabis
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.160]   in one form or another.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.280]   And many of you are probably shouting,
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.120]   what about caffeine?
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.940]   What about caffeine?
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.160]   Well, in the context of drugs
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.580]   and in particular addictive drugs,
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.160]   caffeine doesn't quite rise to the list.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.140]   But if we were to look at caffeine
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.800]   and include in that list,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.560]   caffeine would be above all of those, okay?
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.400]   But the most commonly used drugs are alcohol.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   Second after that is nicotine and then cannabis.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.860]   Nicotine, as some of you may know,
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.320]   if you listen to the episode on nicotine,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.280]   but even if you didn't,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.660]   nicotine comes from the tobacco plant.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.600]   And there are a few other plants that include nicotine.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.400]   And typically it's brought into the brain and body
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.240]   by smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.400]   snuffing tobacco or vaping nicotine.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.640]   Nicotine exists in the outside world in these plants,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.800]   the tobacco plants.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.640]   But the reason it has an effect on the body
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.560]   is that there are so-called
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.640]   nicotinic receptors in the body.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.880]   Now those nicotinic receptors
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.260]   were named after nicotine, the compound,
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.420]   but they existed in the brain and body,
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.980]   not because of the existence of a tobacco plant,
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.080]   but because there are other chemicals in the body
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.960]   that naturally occur, namely acetylcholine
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.080]   that bind the nicotine receptor.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.320]   Those chemicals such as acetylcholine
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.080]   that bind the nicotinic receptor in your brain and body
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.220]   create an enhanced sense of focus, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:18.220]   But nicotine from tobacco binds that same receptor,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.680]   but with much greater affinity
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.560]   and therefore also creates a state of focus,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.080]   but a much greater one than we can achieve without nicotine.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.480]   Okay, so you can see the nicotine episode
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.280]   if you want to learn more about that.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.060]   In a very similar way,
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.540]   all of our brains and bodies
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.120]   from the time that we are conceived,
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.360]   believe it or not, very shortly after conception,
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.740]   if we want to be accurate,
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.360]   very early conception when you were in the womb,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.040]   and still now, if you're listening to this,
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.800]   you have what are called cannabinoid receptors
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.880]   because you also have endogenous cannabinoids.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.720]   What do we mean by that?
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.460]   You have receptors which are like little parking spots
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.340]   that are present on cells in your brain and body.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.680]   And what we call a ligand,
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.560]   which is basically just a chemical that's released,
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.720]   parks in that receptor
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   and causes a number of different biological effects.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.340]   Cannabis contains compounds
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.480]   that also bind to those receptors.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.440]   But here, I want to make a really clear distinction.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.660]   We have what are called endogenous ligands.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.240]   Those that just mean chemicals from within us
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.360]   that we make naturally,
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   even if we never go near the cannabis plant
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.160]   or any other source of cannabis,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.200]   we have chemicals that are created in us
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.320]   that park in those receptors and cause biological effects
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   on mood, on perception, on the immune system,
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.620]   on hunger, et cetera.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.400]   Again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.280]   we have these endogenous cannabinoids.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.680]   Indogenous cannabinoids are floating around in us,
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.080]   or I should say they are released in us in particular ways,
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.040]   bind to these receptors
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.760]   and cause changes in mood, appetite, et cetera.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.720]   They have many different effects on the brain and body.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.680]   We will talk about those.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.200]   But just like with nicotine,
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.280]   there are substances in the outside world,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.800]   in this case, cannabis contains these substances,
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.280]   so things like THC and like CBD,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.040]   that when ingested by smoking or vaping
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.640]   or by ingesting edibles,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.160]   also will park in those same receptors,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.360]   the cannabinoid receptors, and lead to biological effects.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.560]   Now, it's a little bit misleading
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.480]   because we call them cannabinoid receptors
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.440]   as if they were there to bind cannabis,
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   or just like we call the nicotine receptors
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.240]   and nicotinic receptors,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.880]   it makes it seem as if they were there
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.320]   in order to bind nicotine from tobacco.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.560]   But that's not the way our brains and bodies evolved.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.600]   Our brains and bodies evolved for these receptors
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.560]   to make use of chemicals that exist within us
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.480]   called, again, endogenous chemicals.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.200]   And those endogenous chemicals lead to certain effects,
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.440]   as I mentioned before.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.580]   The key thing here,
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.360]   if you haven't understood anything I've said up until now,
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   please understand this.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.560]   The key thing is that THC and CBD
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.420]   and the other components of cannabis bind to those receptors,
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.660]   those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.520]   the ones that we naturally make,
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.800]   with much greater affinity
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.720]   and exert a vastly greater potency
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.820]   and effect on mood and perception, et cetera,
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.940]   than do our endogenous cannabinoids.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.760]   Another analogy that one could take
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.280]   in order to understand this
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.800]   would be hormones like testosterone and estrogen.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.040]   Many people, I would say all people,
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.600]   make testosterone and estrogen to varying degrees.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.280]   It's going to depend on whether or not you're male, female,
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.800]   your age, whether or not you've gone through puberty,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.200]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.360]   But let's just say testosterone, for example.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.960]   There's testosterone circulating in your body.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.800]   That's true if you're male or female.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.060]   And there are receptors called androgen receptors.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.080]   We could even call them testosterone receptors.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.180]   And the testosterone binds to those receptors
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.340]   and has effects on cells.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.660]   It causes hair growth, changes the voice.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.920]   It can affect libido.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.640]   It affects all sorts of things in the brain and body,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.740]   depending on which organ and tissue you're talking about.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.280]   But of course, there are people
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.080]   that take synthetic testosterone
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.000]   or derivatives of testosterone.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.600]   And some of those derivatives, for instance,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   in the bodybuilding community and the sports community,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.260]   they will take things like Diana ball.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.160]   These are modified versions of testosterone
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.120]   that can bind to the testosterone receptor
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.100]   with much greater affinity,
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.820]   or I should say the androgen receptor
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.020]   with much greater affinity
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.060]   and have supra physiological effects,
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.880]   effects that would essentially never be seen
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.760]   from testosterone that was endogenously,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.600]   excuse me, endogenously released within the body.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.280]   We could say the same thing for estrogen.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.820]   There are estrogen receptors, they bind estrogen, okay?
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.240]   But if someone were to take synthetic estrogen
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.720]   or to ingest a plant compound that contains
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.080]   various estrogenic compounds,
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.680]   and those plants certainly exist out there,
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.240]   they can have supra physiological effects
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.800]   on those receptors.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.080]   Why am I telling you this?
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.040]   Well, many people believe that because cannabis,
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.080]   marijuana is a plant and plants grow out of the ground
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.040]   and they're naturally occurring,
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.340]   and because we have receptors in our body
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.040]   that are there without the need to engineer them
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.120]   from some external source, right?
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.720]   They're in our genome, they program for it,
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.700]   and we're born with these things
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.080]   and we keep these our entire life.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.800]   Many people mistakenly think,
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.920]   ah, you know, these plant compounds are safer for us
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.060]   or better for us or are somehow appropriate
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.440]   for us to ingest, but that's simply not true.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.180]   And here, I'm not saying that cannabis
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.720]   is always a bad idea for people.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.440]   There are certain populations and certain people
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.520]   for which it can be relatively safe recreationally,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.440]   that's the truth, and there are other populations
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.440]   for which it can be downright dangerous
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.080]   recreationally or medicinally.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.400]   And of course, there are medicinal purposes
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.600]   that are being explored and we'll talk more about that.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.120]   But this is vital to understand
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.580]   because I think that when we hear,
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.680]   oh, it's from a plant, it's natural,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.200]   and then you also have a receptor for these,
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.080]   endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.480]   and therefore the marriage of those two, right?
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.360]   The coming together of the chemical THC or CBD or both
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.240]   with these receptors is somehow supposed to happen
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.440]   as if this was a purpose of having these receptors,
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.200]   but it's simply not the case in the same way
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.660]   that the nicotinic receptors are not there
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.340]   because nicotine is good for us.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.640]   They're there because there are compounds
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.940]   that exist within us that are good
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.160]   to bind to those receptors from time to time.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.240]   Now, here's the key thing about,
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.760]   I guess today I'm saying there are a lot of key things,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.020]   but here's another key thing about understanding cannabis
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.760]   in the way that it works, which is that THC and CBD,
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   when they're brought into the brain and body
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.440]   by smoking or edible, et cetera,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.960]   they bind to those receptors,
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.080]   those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.460]   and they tap into the same systems
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.800]   that your endogenous cannabinoids would tap into,
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.180]   the ones that affect mood and energy and creativity
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.880]   and relaxation, et cetera,
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   but they do so with thousand-fold greater potency.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.240]   And as a consequence of that,
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.820]   your endogenous cannabinoids are out-competed.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.620]   They really get no opportunity
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.800]   to interact with those receptors.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.040]   And understanding that can lead
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.580]   to a very clear understanding of why, for instance,
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.760]   when people use cannabis to relieve anxiety
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.120]   or they use cannabis to enter a certain brain state
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.640]   for creativity or to enter sleep,
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.080]   why a dependence on cannabis starts to emerge.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.540]   Because if they don't ingest cannabis,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.360]   and again, ingest could mean smoke to bring THC in or CBD in
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.680]   or ingest orally or even transdermal or tincture
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.380]   or one of the other varieties,
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.080]   if they don't do that,
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.300]   then what happens is not only are the receptors
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.480]   not stimulated to the same degree
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.060]   or with the same potency that they normally are,
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.160]   but the endogenous cannabinoids
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.620]   can no longer have their effect.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.160]   So people experience heightened levels of anxiety,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.880]   disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, and so on.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.900]   Now, again, I want to be very clear
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.980]   that I'm not trying to paint a picture of cannabis
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.120]   as all bad or even partially bad.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.400]   What I want to do today is give you as much information I can
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.440]   as to how cannabis works,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.000]   how its different component parts work,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.080]   how the different types of cannabis work,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.680]   and point to some of the valid medicinal uses
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.200]   and some of the recreational uses,
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.040]   and then lay out the landscape for you
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.320]   as to who is really most at risk
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.640]   in terms of psychoactive components, immune components,
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   and so on and so forth
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.520]   so that you can make the most informed choice for you.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.960]   I am not here to tell you what to do or what not to do.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.700]   As I like to say, do as you wish, right?
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.240]   I mean, don't do as you wish
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.440]   if it harms other people or yourself,
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.020]   but do as you wish, but know what you're doing.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.520]   So that's really my goal here.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.600]   So as we begin to dive further into the biology,
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.520]   I think you'll start to get a clearer picture
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.740]   of why cannabis is so effective in some contexts,
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.720]   but also why it can create such massive suffering
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.280]   in other contexts because of the way that it out-competes
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.560]   your own natural endogenous cannabinoid systems.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.760]   So let's talk about those endogenous cannabinoid systems,
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.660]   what they are and how they work,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.400]   because that will give us a lens
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.640]   into what the higher potency or maximum impact
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.120]   of the various cannabis plant varieties and strains
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.960]   and THC and CBD and so forth, how and why those work.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.000]   So what are the endogenous cannabinoids,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.860]   these chemical substances that everybody makes?
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.380]   You make them, I make them,
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.000]   you've been making them basically
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.200]   from the time that you were conceived
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.880]   and you are going to make them until the time that you die.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.520]   Whether or not they have the impact
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.640]   and the biological functions that I'm about to describe
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.560]   will depend a lot on whether or not
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.240]   you are using your own endogenous cannabinoids
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.600]   to park in those receptors
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.960]   that you also have from birth until death,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.760]   or whether or not you are tickling those receptors
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.380]   or strongly activating those receptors
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.380]   using some external source like cannabis, THC, et cetera.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.000]   The two main endogenous cannabinoids
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.680]   that we want to consider are anandamide,
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.320]   which we will refer to as EAE, so anandamide,
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.640]   and another one, which is arachidinoyl glycerol,
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.140]   arachidinoyl glycerol, which we will abbreviate 2AG.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.620]   So let's just take EAE and 2AG,
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.780]   lump them together and talk about the endogenous cannabinoids
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.880]   just to make it simple.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.440]   But if you want to do the deep dive
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.620]   on anandamide versus 2AG, please be my guest.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.980]   The endogenous cannabinoids are released from neurons.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.820]   What are neurons?
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.580]   Neurons are nerve cells,
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.360]   and nerve cells should be conceptualized like this.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.940]   You have presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic neurons.
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.740]   Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.020]   little bubbles full of neurotransmitter, which are chemicals.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.140]   And when neurons are stimulated electrically,
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.540]   and that could be from a thought,
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.800]   it could be from the desire to move,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.700]   it could be because of a drug,
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.500]   it could be because you're hungry,
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.340]   the relevant neurons will vomit out
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.620]   or will fuse, as we say, those little packets,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.500]   those little bubbles of neurotransmitter
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.940]   into the gap between the pre- and postsynaptic neuron.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.540]   We call that a synaptic cleft or the synapse.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.920]   It's a little gap, a little space.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.760]   And the neurotransmitter flows across that synapse,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.480]   and some of it will park in little parking spots
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.460]   that we call receptors on the postsynaptic neuron side.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.400]   Depending on which neurotransmitter it is,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.340]   and a bunch of other things not worth going into right now,
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.400]   the parking of that chemical
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.800]   in those neurotransmitter receptors
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.900]   will either cause that neuron on the postsynaptic side
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.700]   to itself release neurotransmitter elsewhere,
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.640]   or it will quiet it down,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.400]   so-called excitation and inhibition.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.540]   That's kind of neurotransmission in a nutshell.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.220]   If you don't understand it, no big deal.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.100]   It's not going to prevent you
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.380]   from understanding today's discussion.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.380]   If you understand even a small fraction
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.780]   of what I've just said,
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.680]   then it's going to allow you to understand
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.940]   not just today's discussion, but a lot of neuroscience
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.540]   with a lot more nuance and depth of understanding.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:18.940]   The key thing to know about the endogenous cannabinoids
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.500]   is that unlike most neurotransmitters,
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.700]   they are released from the postsynaptic side.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.920]   So what happens is neurotransmitter
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.100]   goes from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron,
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.000]   but under certain conditions,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.480]   the postsynaptic neuron itself releases a chemical,
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.340]   and that chemical goes backward,
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.340]   what we call retrogradely, to the presynaptic neuron,
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.980]   binds the receptors there,
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.580]   and changes the probability that the presynaptic neuron
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.080]   will release neurotransmitter.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.460]   Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.140]   tend to decrease the probability
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.000]   that a neuron will release neurotransmitter.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.760]   They are sort of a brake on the system.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.100]   They are a way of shutting down
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.120]   the communication between neurons, regulating it,
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.500]   not to make it completely quiet,
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.660]   but to adjust the levels with a lot of nuance.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.620]   Now, the other thing that the endogenous cannabinoids do
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.420]   is sort of a mind bender,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.300]   because we're talking about cannabis,
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.620]   and a commonly known feature
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.980]   of cannabis and marijuana consumption
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.020]   is disruptions in short-term memory.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.220]   And there is essentially zero debate
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.500]   as to whether or not that occurs,
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.780]   and we'll talk about the mechanisms a little bit later.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.680]   And yet endogenous cannabinoids,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.300]   the chemicals that you naturally release
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.720]   from these postsynaptic neurons
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.240]   that travel retrogradely back to the presynaptic neuron,
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.820]   actually can lead to strengthening of connections
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.280]   between the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.600]   through a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.140]   They can also cause what's called depression
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.680]   of communication between a presynaptic neuron
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.980]   and a postsynaptic neuron.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.580]   Long-term depression has nothing to do
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.560]   with depression as a psychological state or as a illness.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.060]   Long-term potentiation and long-term depression
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.940]   simply refer to the probability
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.380]   that one neuron will be able to stimulate
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.240]   and activate another neuron.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.680]   And as I just told you,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.220]   the endogenous cannabinoids can either turn up the dial
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.420]   or turn down the dial.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.340]   They can either increase the probability
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.060]   or decrease the probability
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.580]   that a given connection between neurons
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.340]   will function more or will function less.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.060]   So if you think about the communication between neurons
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.860]   as a crosstalk, as a conversation,
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.580]   well, the endogenous cannabinoids can dictate
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.900]   whether or not that conversation is likely to occur
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.740]   or not to occur.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.380]   Think of them as either putting someone
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.320]   at the top of your text chain in your phone,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.460]   which would be long-term potentiation,
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.100]   or essentially blocking their number,
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.680]   which would essentially be long-term depression.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.880]   So if you're getting the impression
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.240]   that the endogenous cannabinoids
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.160]   are working in a number of different ways
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.200]   and it's not very straightforward, you're right.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.420]   In fact, that's the message that I'd like you to take away.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.260]   The endogenous cannabinoids
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.440]   are sometimes increasing neuronal communication.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.440]   This can lead to increases in mood
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.840]   or increases in the likelihood
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.380]   that someone will talk a certain way
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.760]   or behave a certain way or feel a certain way.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.220]   They can also lead to decreases in synaptic transmission,
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.760]   that is communication between neurons,
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.180]   in ways that will make somebody's mood lower
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.380]   or will make them less hungry or more hungry.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.960]   And here's the really key thing.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.260]   There are two kinds of endogenous cannabinoid receptors
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.940]   referred to as CB1 and CB2.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.960]   And we can say with confidence
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.620]   that CB1 is highly enriched in the nervous system
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.160]   and especially within the brain.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.480]   It's found not everywhere,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.060]   but almost everywhere in the brain
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.180]   and elsewhere in the nervous system,
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.900]   so spinal cord and other aspects of the nervous system.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.640]   CB2, the cannabinoid receptor.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.500]   CB2 is largely located in the tissues of the body,
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.660]   including the immune system, the liver,
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.040]   even the genitals, et cetera.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.680]   So what this means is that the endogenous cannabinoids
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.880]   are having these sorts of effects on neurons
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.720]   that I talked about,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.660]   but they are also having effects on immune cells,
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.420]   on reproductive organs, on liver, on digestion,
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.660]   on hunger, et cetera,
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.640]   through mechanisms that are divorced from the function
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.900]   of the nervous system of neurons.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.860]   Now, in reality, no system of the brain and body
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.060]   is divorced from the nervous system
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.340]   because the nervous system is controlling everything.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.620]   There is really the master controller
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.440]   and everything's feeding back to the nervous system,
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.880]   so it's a two-way street.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.180]   But the simple way to think about it is CB1 receptors
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.140]   are mainly in the nervous system
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.300]   and CB2 receptors are mainly in the body
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.020]   and endogenous cannabinoids.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:50.020]   Again, EAE, anatomide, and 2AG, arachidinol glycerol,
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.460]   are impacting CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.740]   Today, we're mainly going to talk about CB1 receptors
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.220]   'cause they are the ones that are responsible
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.780]   for most of the familiar effects of cannabis.
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.500]   But the key takeaway at this point
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.920]   is to really understand that the major effects
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.740]   of your endogenous cannabinoids on these receptors
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.220]   in this particular CB1 are very nuanced.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.260]   It depends on context, it depends on which neurons.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.020]   It's sometimes increasing communication between neurons,
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.940]   sometimes decreasing it.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.260]   And then along comes cannabis,
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.280]   and that cannabis, again, can arrive by smoking,
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.780]   by vaping, by edible.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.060]   And cannabis contains THC and CBD
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:34.700]   that potently bind the CB1 receptor.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.900]   And now the effects of the CB1 receptor
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:42.380]   being occupied by THC or being occupied by CBD
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.860]   are not very nuanced.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.500]   In fact, they are very predictable.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.120]   And especially important is to understand
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.220]   that they are so strong and they park in that receptor
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.500]   with such affinity, with such force and precision
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.100]   and stubbornness and refusal to leave that receptor
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.020]   that they completely out-compete
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.100]   the endogenous cannabinoid system.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.440]   In fact, they leave the endogenous cannabinoid system
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   essentially dysfunctional,
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.920]   which in some cases may be a good thing,
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.280]   but in most cases is going to lead to problems
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.120]   of various kinds.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.520]   And we'll talk about what sorts of problems.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.120]   And again, I feel obligated to say,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.220]   this is not me saying don't ingest cannabis or THC or CBD.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.400]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   What I'm saying is if you evaluate the potency,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.440]   that is in technical terms,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.520]   it would be the affinity with which these compounds,
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:37.240]   THC and CBD and CBN bind to these endogenous receptors,
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.820]   that would be like a howitzer gun,
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   like a cannon going off as compared to endogenous cannabinoid
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.580]   whether or not it's EAE or 2AG,
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.700]   which is more like a cap gun level of activation,
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:50.980]   at least in this analogy.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.700]   So now you have what at least I would like to think
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.620]   is a fairly complete understanding
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.780]   of the different varieties of cannabis,
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.360]   at least at a broad sweep
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.100]   and the different biological effects that they can have,
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.860]   at least in terms of the major receptors
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.940]   and in retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.500]   Now let's take a step back into the real world
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.140]   and evaluate or think about what happens
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.660]   when somebody smokes cannabis or ingest cannabis
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.460]   by way of edible or tincture or something of that sort.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:25.400]   Cannabis is very fast to enter the bloodstream.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.940]   In fact, within 30 seconds,
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.060]   it's going to enter the brain
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.320]   and permeate throughout the brain and body.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.720]   That's very, very fast.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.280]   I mean, we contrast that with something like alcohol
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.160]   or even nicotine, depending on how the nicotine is delivered,
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.560]   that is a very fast delivery of the psychoactive
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.340]   and biologically active compound,
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.480]   which in this case is THC and CBD
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.780]   and probably some other things as well.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.920]   So within 30 seconds,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.920]   it reaches the brain and bodily tissues
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.140]   and within 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.620]   it's going to reach its peak concentrations
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.920]   and have its peak biological effects.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.940]   Those aren't always the same thing,
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.660]   but in the case of cannabis,
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.780]   and again, here I'm using cannabis
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.520]   as a kind of an umbrella term for THC and CBD,
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.700]   the effects are going to peak at about 30 to 60 minutes
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.360]   after bringing those compounds into the body
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.040]   in some way or another.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.360]   And the effects tend to last
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.980]   anywhere from three to four hours,
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.720]   although there's some variation on that
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.860]   depending on individual metabolism,
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.340]   whether or not somebody is familiar with the compound,
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.800]   believe it or not, psychologically familiar,
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.480]   but also biologically familiar,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.780]   or whether or not it's a first time use
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.180]   or occasional use and so on.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.660]   THC and CBD and other components of cannabis
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.560]   are highly what we call lipophilic.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.360]   That is they have an affinity toward
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.480]   and they can actually pass through fatty tissues.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.560]   Now, every cell in your body,
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.860]   but especially neurons have a double layer of fat
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:49.960]   on their outside.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.800]   And of course, when people hear fat,
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.100]   they always think, "Ooh, fat's bad, fat's whatever."
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.000]   Most of the world seems to want to lose fat or bodily fat.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.840]   Here we're talking about the fatty membrane,
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.600]   the barrier around each tissue.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.400]   In this case, we're talking particularly about neurons.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.740]   And THC and CBD and the other components of cannabis
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.040]   are highly lipophilic.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.920]   So they can get into essentially all cells
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.720]   just simply by flowing into them.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.000]   They will also remain in those cells for a long time.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.320]   So I know that a number of people,
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.920]   depending on whether or not they get tested for work
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:26.320]   or for sport or otherwise for cannabis or CBD and THC,
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.980]   don't take this as a strict number,
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:33.980]   but typically if one ingests CBD or THC,
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.900]   smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera,
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.740]   it doesn't matter.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.900]   It's going to stay in that fatty tissue and can be detected
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.740]   for at least as long as 80 days after ingestion.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.780]   And there's a whole industry as to
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.880]   how to accelerate the clearance.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.280]   And I should just tell you that just losing bodily fat
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.360]   isn't going to eliminate it from your system,
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.420]   maybe partially in those fat cells,
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   but certainly intravisceral fat and other fatty tissue
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.380]   that's in and around the brain and body
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.700]   is going to harbor that THC molecule and the CBD molecule
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.060]   for quite a long while, at least 80 days.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.160]   Okay, so if someone smokes cannabis
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.740]   or they ingest cannabis,
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.400]   very rapidly gets into the bloodstream
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.160]   and the components that are psychoactive
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.200]   get into the bloodstream
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.560]   and are immediately able to access neurons and other cells
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.020]   and start having these effects of parking
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.220]   at those endogenous cannabinoid receptors
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.480]   and impacting the signaling between neurons,
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.980]   which leads to the subjective effects of cannabis,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.300]   including THC and CBD.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.140]   So let's talk about
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:38.540]   what those different subjective effects are.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.480]   Again, this is going to vary depending on whether or not
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.700]   people are ingesting sativa varieties of cannabis.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.140]   Just to remind you, those tend to be elevated.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.980]   Mood, alertness, talkativeness,
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.740]   people who take sativa varieties tend to talk a lot more
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.380]   than they would otherwise.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.820]   Again, there are exceptions to this.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.020]   Of course, there are exceptions.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.360]   I'm sure there are people out there shouting,
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.620]   although I guess if you're the quiet people
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.460]   who don't talk too much, you're probably not shouting,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.900]   or if you're not, you're not doing it on sativa.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.940]   Joke intended, but in any event, there are exceptions,
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.720]   but there are also general rules.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.060]   And the sativas tend to meet people sort of mood elevated,
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.040]   energetic, again, the sort of head high,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.500]   and indica varieties tend to do the opposite,
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.900]   more of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.720]   Why and how would they do that?
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.300]   Okay, without going into an extensive deep dive
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.840]   into the different neurotransmitter systems
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.600]   of the brain and body, what we know for sure
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.320]   is that CB1 receptors are present on an enormous number
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.980]   of different neurons and brain structures
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.980]   and neural circuits so that the sativa varieties
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:42.820]   that act as sort of a stimulant, making people feel happy,
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.420]   'cause in general, they do tend to elevate mood,
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.460]   at least at certain dosages.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:51.920]   Talkative tend to make people feel like they have ideas
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.500]   that are interesting, that they might want to share,
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.260]   tend to narrow their context, so tend to increase focus.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.420]   This is something that's not often discussed about cannabis,
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.280]   but it can, especially the sativa varieties
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.380]   can increase people's level of focus to particular things,
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.260]   something they're watching or something they're doing,
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.860]   or music allows them to narrow their sense of focus.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:13.420]   That's going to occur by activation of CB1 receptors
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.900]   in the so-called prefrontal cortex,
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.540]   which is just behind the forehead.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.860]   And the prefrontal cortex acts as a strong modulator
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.580]   of so-called limbic circuitry and other circuitry
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.560]   that is more stress-oriented.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.960]   The way to think about the stress and limbic circuitry,
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.360]   such as the amygdala, which many people have heard about,
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.200]   is that they aren't really circuits for fear and stress.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.360]   They are circuits that are constantly evaluating
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.240]   one's own internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.200]   and what's happening externally.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.360]   And sorry to say, but the default of those systems
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   is to detect danger, the sort of threat detection systems.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.500]   And then the prefrontal cortex largely acts
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.300]   as a brake on those systems,
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.140]   sort of like the reins pulling back on a steed of horses
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.440]   that would otherwise just kind of take off.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.280]   And so the sativa varieties tend to increase CB1 activation
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.080]   in the prefrontal cortex and in other circuitry
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.220]   that then leads to a kind of overall reduction in stress
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:06.660]   because of the way that prefrontal circuitry
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.220]   can reduce activation of the amygdala.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.540]   Now that of course does not explain
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.520]   why some people become very stressed and very paranoid
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.160]   when they smoke sativa varieties
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.940]   or other varieties of cannabis or ingest other varieties
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.780]   of cannabis.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.520]   We will talk about the paranoid effect and why that occurs
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.200]   and who might predict that would occur to them
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.720]   in a little bit.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.920]   But I just want to give you a sense of how this is working
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.320]   because as I mentioned before,
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.860]   THC and/or CBD are going to bind that CB1 receptor,
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.060]   let's say in prefrontal cortex
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.360]   and neurons of prefrontal cortex is going to bind there.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.320]   And then there'll be a retrograde signaling
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.640]   back to the presynaptic neuron.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.420]   And in the case of prefrontal cortex,
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.420]   what's happening is it's increasing transmission,
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.100]   increasing the release of neurotransmitter
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.700]   in prefrontal cortex.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.460]   However, at the same time,
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:56.500]   the very same THC and CBD that was brought into the system
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.060]   is binding the very same type of receptors,
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.260]   CB1 receptors in other brain structures
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.340]   such as the amygdala
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.780]   and causing retrograde signaling
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:09.160]   back to the presynaptic neurons in the amygdala,
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.240]   but it's quieting the activation of those neurons.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.440]   So this is interesting, right?
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.220]   We have the same compounds, THC and/or CBD
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.860]   brought into the body and brain,
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.880]   binding the same receptors,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.180]   in this case, the CB1 receptors,
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.460]   but depending on where those receptors are located
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.100]   and which brain areas we're referring to,
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.740]   they are either causing heightened levels
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.860]   of alertness and activation of systems
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.500]   that are designed to make you talkative
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.220]   and alertness and mood, et cetera, focus,
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.700]   or they are causing suppression of those circuitries.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.680]   So we have kind of a seesaw effect here
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.900]   where the same compound is increasing mood and alertness
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.220]   and focus in the prefrontal cortex
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:54.500]   and is decreasing stress and threat detection
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.980]   in the amygdala.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.380]   And that's one of the reasons why,
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.340]   especially the sativa varieties of cannabis,
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.760]   allow people to enter these states of focus.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.940]   Some might even say flow,
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.780]   although I don't want to go into
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.380]   what flow states really are,
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.180]   that's for a different discussion
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:12.580]   and it's very poorly defined as it is.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.340]   And I certainly don't want to give people the impression
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.060]   that cannabis increases flow states
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.620]   because that's not always the case
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.020]   and certainly most often is not going to be the case.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.100]   But the idea here is that this molecule
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.060]   comes into our brain and is shifting everything
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.220]   towards a state of focus, elevated mood,
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.900]   of heightened sense of importance
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.820]   about whatever it is that we happen to be doing.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.380]   And now of course, whatever we could happen to be doing
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.540]   could be writing a song, writing poetry,
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.540]   communicating with somebody,
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.240]   but it could also be something as trivial
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.820]   as watching cartoons or watching a movie,
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.100]   which is not trivial in its own right,
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.860]   but in terms of thinking about the creative aspects
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.220]   or the creativity stimulating aspects of cannabis
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.000]   and not sort of productivity oriented.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.020]   So narrowed focus, elevated mood,
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.200]   more relaxed and yet energetic.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.220]   That's the major effects of the sativa varieties, except,
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.860]   and this is a really big, bold face, triple underlined,
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.320]   except in some individuals, depending on dosage,
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.340]   but also depending on preexisting neural circuitry
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.240]   and propensity for anxiety,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.980]   some people ingest or smoke sativa varieties
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.920]   and regardless of whether or not it's a type one,
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.940]   type two or type three variety, okay?
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:29.140]   Regardless of the ratio between THC and CBD,
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:33.900]   people will experience intense anxiety and paranoia.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.620]   Now, how do you predict?
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:38.180]   Who will experience intense anxiety and paranoia
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.700]   and who will experience intense relaxation, focus
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.220]   and sense of creativity from ingesting or smoking
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.920]   a type one, type two or type three sativa?
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.540]   Well, there is no way to predict that.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.980]   And there's a lot of kind of what I would call street lore
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.860]   or dorm room lore or kind of peer, not peer reviewed,
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.420]   but sort of peer discussed.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.620]   I mean, among friends and people and acquaintances lore
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.440]   out there that what one needs to do is simply smoke more,
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.500]   right, or just ingest more, you hear that.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.040]   Oh, well, listen, if it makes you paranoid,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.340]   you simply need to use more.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.820]   That is absolutely categorically false.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.160]   Everything we know about the way that THC and CBD work
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.020]   is that they tend to potentiate,
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:25.020]   that is increase the effects of these different systems
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.260]   at given synapses and in different areas
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.100]   of the brain and body.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.860]   That is if someone experiences paranoia or anxiety
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.100]   from a given strain of the marijuana plant
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.260]   or from ingesting an edible in a particular way
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.780]   or a particular kind of edible,
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.820]   that person is very likely to experience the same effect
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.400]   every time they ingest that strain or variety.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.980]   This is part of what's led to this enormous industry.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.080]   I mean, there are a number of different reasons,
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.220]   but this is part of what's led to this enormous industry
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.500]   of highly customized cannabis,
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.040]   where people will spend some time really seeking out
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.380]   the different strains of cannabis and hybrids of cannabis
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.980]   that work best for them
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.660]   and work best for them in particular context.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.340]   I wish I could tell you that if you are a person who is,
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.280]   you know, between five foot seven and six feet tall,
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.400]   and you have blue eyes or brown eyes,
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.780]   that the sativa varieties are going to be right for you
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.060]   or that the sativa varieties
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.440]   are going to give you panic attacks, I can't do that.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.860]   The only way to determine it would be to actually experience
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.160]   ingesting those or smoking those,
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.420]   which is certainly also not what I'm suggesting, right?
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.260]   That's up to you.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.180]   I'm not telling you what to do or what not to do,
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.980]   but there are no good predictors.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.920]   In fact, if you look in the literature,
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.100]   it is not at all clear
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.420]   that people who have a heightened level of anxiety
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.980]   when they do not smoke cannabis
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.980]   will experience cannabis as less paranoia inducing
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.220]   or more relaxing.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.180]   That's simply not the case.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.900]   Now, what we can say for sure
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.740]   is that general categories of effects
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.580]   such as increased focus and reduced anxiety
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.420]   are largely due to activation of areas
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.860]   like the prefrontal cortex.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.180]   Now, unlike other compounds like nicotine or alcohol
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.160]   or neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.400]   when we talk about the cannabinoid system,
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.960]   and I say effects, biological effects, psychoactive effects,
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.640]   I want you to keep in mind always, please, please, please,
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.480]   keep in mind that those effects can be varied
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.660]   and often opposite in direction.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.860]   So let's just give an example of that.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.780]   I just mentioned that when people smoke or eat sativa,
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.660]   that it tends to lead to one specific set of,
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.540]   or generally leads to one specific set of effects,
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.920]   heightened focus, mood, et cetera.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.620]   Whereas when they ingest or smoke indica
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.320]   and its components, right?
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.860]   Again, we're still talking about THC and CBD
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.580]   in varying ratios, but now indica cannabis,
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.220]   and you say, well, why would it improve
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.140]   the transition time to sleep?
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.480]   Or at least give people the impression
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.020]   that it improved the transition time to sleep.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.200]   We'll talk about what indica actually does for sleep
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.420]   in a little bit.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.360]   But indica also tends to suppress activation
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.600]   of the amygdala and threat detection centers in the brain.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.560]   Again, binding the same CB1 receptors
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.640]   and those retrograde signaling mechanisms
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.100]   that talked about before.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.320]   But it also tends to shut down the hippocampus,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.720]   an area of the brain associated with memory,
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.040]   which is why indica varieties lead to pronounced,
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.400]   or I should say profound defects in short-term memory
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.020]   and sometimes in long-term memory as well
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.880]   if it's consumed over long periods of time.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.220]   We'll talk about short, medium and long-term consumption,
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.000]   occasional consumption going forward.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.060]   So what I'd like you to take away
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.860]   from this component of the discussion is,
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.900]   first of all, the mechanism of action
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:48.260]   by which cannabis impacts the brain and body,
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.680]   but in particular, the brain is going to be
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.420]   through CB1 receptors and those CB1 receptors
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.000]   can lead to either an acceleration or a break
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.680]   on particular biological mechanisms.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.600]   And there are going to be a constellation
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.960]   of different accelerations and breaking
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:05.160]   of different neural systems in the brain and body,
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.920]   depending on whether or not people ingest sativa
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.360]   or indica or some hybrid strain.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.860]   And perhaps most importantly,
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.620]   even if you didn't understand anything that I've said
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.360]   about the biology of these different strains
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.520]   and the receptors, please do understand
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.720]   that there is no way to predict what the effect
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.340]   of a given strain will be on an individual.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.720]   There has been extensive exploration
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.340]   as to whether or not people who are so-called mellower
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:32.280]   or more anxious or any number
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.240]   of different personality dimensions will respond
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.120]   in one way or the other.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.580]   But in fact, there is no way to tell.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:43.240]   Layer on top of that, the fact that dosing THC and CBD
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.320]   can be fairly straightforward in the form of edibles, right?
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.240]   Because there can be, at least if it's a controlled source,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.560]   a defined number of milligrams of THC,
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.960]   a defined number of milligrams of CBD.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.920]   That's true for ingestibles.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.120]   It's much harder to gauge that
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.560]   from the smokable forms of cannabis,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.440]   especially if those smokable forms of cannabis
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.680]   are obtained through sources
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.160]   where there isn't a lot of clear information
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.260]   about the total amount of THC in that product.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:13.280]   Now, this is all changing quite a lot nowadays
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.520]   because of the commercialization of THC and CBD products
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.520]   and cannabis in a number of different areas,
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.220]   including in the United States.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.960]   But still many people are ingesting cannabis, THC, CBD
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.200]   through sources where they don't really know
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.040]   how much they're bringing into their system.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.160]   And so whether or not someone
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.880]   gets incredible anxiety relief,
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.820]   enhanced sense of mood and focus and wellbeing,
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.060]   pain relief, et cetera,
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.640]   or whether or not they have full-blown panic attacks,
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.920]   et cetera, is very hard to predict
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.200]   based on dosage information alone.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.700]   Now, of course, we can create broad categories,
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.900]   and we were going to talk about studies
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.880]   that create broad categories of low dose,
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.660]   moderate dose, and high dose,
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.920]   frequent use and infrequent use.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.740]   But unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.620]   we can't really point to specificity
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.720]   of X amount of alcohol, grams of alcohol per week,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.720]   which is safe, or X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.220]   And so I know a lot of people out there are wondering,
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.260]   how often can they smoke cannabis?
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.860]   Or how often can they eat cannabis or THC or CBD
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:21.220]   in any number of its different forms and products safely?
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.740]   Well, we have to really define what safely means,
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.240]   and we have to really acknowledge
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.420]   that there's a pretty loose set of controls
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.500]   over what one is bringing into their brain and body
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.180]   as they ingest THC and CBD.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.440]   But even under conditions in which it's very controlled,
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.040]   it's very hard to predict what those effects will be.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.940]   So before moving into specifics of taking cannabis
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.740]   or not taking cannabis, who should, who shouldn't,
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.180]   what the medicinal purposes are,
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.580]   and what some of the newer exciting data point to,
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.900]   I just briefly want to make a list,
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.660]   and I promise very briefly, I know I'm not often concise,
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.380]   but I do try to be thorough for your sake.
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.640]   I want to make a very brief list
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:06.580]   of the different brain areas that are impacted by THC and CBD
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:10.160]   and why THC and CBD have the various effects they do.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:17.320]   When somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.480]   doesn't matter what the THC or CBD ratio is,
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:26.720]   if they experience deficits in memory,
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.940]   and that's almost always present,
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.720]   that's going to be because of reductions
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.740]   in electrical activity within this brain region
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.400]   we call the hippocampus, okay?
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.580]   Hippocampus means seahorse, it's shaped like a seahorse,
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.400]   anatomists like to name things after what things look like,
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.420]   but hippocampus memory is reduced
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.000]   in particular short-term memory.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.820]   That's true regardless of whether or not
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:50.980]   one is using sativa, indica, or some hybrid.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:55.860]   In general, the prefrontal cortex
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.540]   is going to be activated by the sativa varieties,
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.060]   which is going to increase thinking
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:04.240]   and narrowly constrain focus to some activity,
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.680]   and that's more commonly associated
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.040]   with the sativa varieties.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.160]   The indica varieties, as I mentioned before,
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.200]   tend to lead to a suppression of activity
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.440]   in prefrontal cortex, believe it or not,
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.640]   and turn off thinking and planning.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:20.360]   This is why indica varieties are often used for relaxation
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.920]   and for promoting sleep.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.420]   Regardless of whether or not sativa or indica variety,
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:30.760]   and again, regardless of the ratio of THC to CBD,
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   there is a general suppression of neural circuits
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.960]   within the so-called basal ganglia and cerebellum.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.520]   Basal ganglia and cerebellum are areas of the brain
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.120]   that are involved in action planning and withholding action,
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.280]   so that would be the basal ganglia,
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.800]   so-called go/no-go circuitry,
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.400]   and the cerebellum, which is involved in balance,
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.020]   but also motor planning and motor sequencing.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:54.700]   This is why people who smoke marijuana,
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.040]   regardless of the strain,
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.000]   will tend to be less physically mobile.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.520]   Other common effects are reddening of the eyes,
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.440]   dryness of the mouth.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.280]   That's actually caused by the same general mechanism,
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.320]   which is a reduction in the secretion of saliva
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.420]   and of sort of tears and lubrication of the eyes
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.180]   from the lacrimal glands of the eyes
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.760]   because of the presence of largely CB2,
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.380]   but also CB1 receptors in the mouth and on the eyes.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.340]   And there tends to be,
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.040]   especially with certain strains of cannabis,
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.840]   increase in appetite, so-called munchies,
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.420]   and that has everything to do with very, very high density
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.600]   of CB1 receptors in the hypothalamus,
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.360]   and in particular areas of the hypothalamus,
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.860]   like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.640]   other areas as well, of course,
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:46.440]   that have tons of CB1 receptors, bind THC and CBD,
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.760]   and activate the neurons that strongly stimulate appetite
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.260]   through two mechanisms.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.140]   One is a cognitive mechanism of creating a preoccupation
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.000]   with food and anticipation of taste,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.840]   as well as the experience of taste,
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.260]   so the narrowing of focus to what you want to go eat,
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.880]   you really crave, I don't know, pizza,
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.680]   it seems to be high fat, high carbohydrate foods,
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   but really crave pizza and narrowing of focus
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.160]   so that you're not thinking about anything else,
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.920]   but also signaling from the hypothalamus to the gut,
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.320]   to neurons within the stomach itself
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.040]   that regulate blood sugar.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.820]   So there are strong effects on blood sugar of THC and CBD
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.960]   that generally lead to increases in appetite.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.680]   So two parallel mechanisms, one within the brain,
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.900]   one within the body, increasing appetite.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.320]   So there's an array of different effects.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.600]   And as I mentioned before,
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.100]   CB1 receptors are present all over the nervous system
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.200]   in the brain, the spinal cord.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.920]   In fact, the presence of CB1 receptors in the spinal cord
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.300]   largely explains the fact that THC and CBD,
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.360]   to some extent, although it's not very well studied,
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.420]   can provide some pain relief.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:55.760]   I say some because a lot of people perceive
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.480]   or believe that they experience more pain relief
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.680]   from cannabis than they actually do.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.260]   It actually has a lot to do with a perceptual shift
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.920]   to basically focusing on other things,
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.360]   but there does seem to be some anti-nociceptive,
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:13.000]   meaning anti-pain effects of cannabis, THC in particular,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.400]   and that is exerted largely through effects
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.700]   on CB1 receptors in neurons of the spinal cord.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.960]   So a broad array of effects are taking place,
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.300]   regardless of what strain you take
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.500]   and whether or not you eat the cannabis
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.960]   or you smoke the cannabis.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.000]   And the broad array of effects can be explained by the fact
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.240]   that that retrograde signaling can lead to activation
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.920]   or suppression of activity in various neurons.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.520]   So now I'd like to take a step back
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.040]   from the biology of cannabis and THC and CBD
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.000]   and all the signaling and receptors, et cetera,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.120]   and really just focus on cannabis use.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.280]   And wherever possible,
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.680]   I will point to the specific strains that have been studied
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.200]   and the ratios of THC to CBD.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.260]   But I have to say that unfortunately,
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.460]   most studies of marijuana of cannabis,
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.800]   while they have been very careful
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.440]   to detail the amount of THC,
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.960]   low dose, medium dose, or high dose,
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.060]   and actually getting very specific,
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.320]   right down to the number of milligrams
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.280]   or even how much circulating THC is present
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:13.280]   after somebody smokes a joint or ingests cannabis,
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.960]   most studies have not distinguished
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.880]   between sativa and indica strains.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.160]   And that's unfortunate because in the real world,
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.420]   people are distinguishing between sativa and indica strains
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.240]   in their patterns of use and what they prefer
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.120]   and what they don't prefer,
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.280]   even what they prefer to smoke during the day
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.640]   or ingest during the day versus night.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.480]   Believe it or not, there are people
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.860]   who are using certain strains during the day
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.220]   and other strains at night.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.640]   But the science is yet to catch up to that.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.760]   Or I should say more accurately,
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.380]   the general public and the themes that are emerging
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.960]   and the practices that are emerging around cannabis,
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.240]   especially in states where it's decriminalized or legalized,
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.600]   are occurring at such a rapid rate
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.800]   that there's absolutely no way
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.120]   that the science could keep up.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.200]   This is a naturally occurring experiment.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.080]   Not to say that it's natural, like people should do it,
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.160]   but it's an experiment that's happening in real time
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.100]   in the real world,
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.080]   much faster than controlled studies
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.360]   within university laboratories
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.920]   and other laboratories can keep up.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.680]   So at this point, I think it's appropriate to ask ourselves,
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.760]   why do people even use cannabis?
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.060]   I mean, what are they trying to achieve?
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.380]   Is it always about not feeling pain?
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.360]   Is it always about reducing anxiety?
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.260]   Well, sometimes it is,
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.520]   but oftentimes people are using cannabis
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.840]   in order to achieve a particular state.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.960]   And we could use a broad brush and say,
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.940]   well, they just like being high,
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.680]   but while that may be true in a lot of circumstances,
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.260]   and I have to believe it actually is true
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.560]   in a lot of circumstances,
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.900]   there are a lot of people who use cannabis
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.480]   in a very directed way,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.020]   or they get quote unquote high in order to achieve states
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.460]   that to them are particularly attractive.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:49.080]   And one such state is a state of creativity.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   And this brings us to a broader theme,
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.360]   which is does cannabis increase creativity?
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.720]   And if so, is it the THC, the CBD?
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.080]   What's the appropriate ratio
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.880]   or the best ratio for accessing creativity?
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.840]   This is an interesting and important discussion, I believe,
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.880]   because creativity is one of the more sought after
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.800]   and more elusive states that humans can experience.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.200]   And yet, if you look at human evolution,
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.960]   you look at our progression
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.000]   in terms of technology development and culture
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.480]   and music and poetry, et cetera,
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.680]   we really can look to creativity as the state
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.580]   that fostered so much of that evolution.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.460]   So whether or not you're into technology
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.200]   or you're into art or music,
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.440]   whether or not you're just somebody
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.800]   who wants to expand their understanding
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.700]   or their experience of life in some way,
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:37.140]   creativity is a fundamentally important state
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.440]   to try and access and to try and access regularly
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.720]   and to try and tap into
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.360]   in order to eventually produce something,
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.560]   in order to create something of meaning that exists,
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.840]   not just in that creative state, but to yourself
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.960]   after that creative state has gone away, right?
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.880]   So the painting that you paint in the creative state
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.040]   hopefully is a painting that still inspires
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.340]   and has impact after you exit that creative state
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.800]   and that will inspire others.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.840]   And this could be true for any number of different things,
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.220]   not just painting.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:06.080]   So does cannabis increase creativity?
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.420]   The short answer is it depends.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.600]   First of all, we need to define creativity, right?
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.780]   Here we are as thinking as scientists,
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.560]   if not already scientists.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.320]   And there are basically two modes of thinking
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.720]   that are associated with creativity
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.420]   and they don't completely explain creativity.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.760]   But if you look in the research, the psychology research
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.300]   and the neuroscience research,
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.400]   you'll hear about convergent thinking
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.680]   and divergent thinking.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.380]   Convergent thinking is taking loose ideas
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.680]   and kind of braiding them together,
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.840]   finding a common thread,
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.920]   synthesizing and organizing those different ideas
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:45.200]   into some common or specific framework
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.140]   in order to get or create some specific outcome.
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:53.340]   So convergent thinking is basically the person in the room
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.860]   who's listening to all the ideas and taking them all in.
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:01.860]   Maybe it's a panel of how should we get a certain product
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:06.060]   out to market or what are the different motifs
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.840]   that we should include in a piece of music?
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.360]   Or what should we do in terms of re-architecting
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.080]   a given physical space,
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.560]   taking in those different opinions,
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.520]   those different ideas from different people,
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.240]   and then synthesizing them and coming up with one
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.440]   or a small subset of coherent ideas
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.080]   that incorporate some or all of the ones that they heard.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.360]   Okay, so that's convergent thinking.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.240]   It doesn't have to involve a panel of people talking to you.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.640]   I use that as an example of what goes on
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.480]   inside your own head
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.200]   when you are engaging in convergent thinking.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.600]   You're thinking, well, so-and-so said this, and I think that,
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.680]   and you're kind of braiding them through
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.200]   and trying to get some common theme,
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.960]   some common vector to emerge from that.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.320]   Divergent thinking, on the other hand,
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.440]   is best described as brainstorming.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.120]   It's exploring ideas and continuing to move
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.840]   into the variation and the vastness of ideas
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.000]   in hopes of eventually being able to converge
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.640]   on some novel idea or framework, okay?
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.080]   So these are similar and related,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.960]   but typically the creativity process
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.960]   involves first brainstorming and divergent thinking,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.240]   and then in order to arrive at something,
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.960]   to actually create something, right?
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.680]   The verb create, not just thinking about
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.380]   what you might create, which occurs during divergent thinking
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.200]   but actually creating something, a specific painting,
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.480]   a specific song, a specific body of literature,
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.580]   a specific scientific project or experiment, and so on.
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:32.920]   That usually involves convergent thinking.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.600]   Now, these can be explored in the laboratory,
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.240]   and they can be explored in the laboratories
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.240]   through sets of different types of questionnaires
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.200]   or even tasks that you can give human subjects,
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.280]   and this has been done extensively.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.000]   And across the entire body of data,
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.740]   and by that I mean literally hundreds of studies
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.900]   that have explored the relationship
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.120]   between particular neural circuits and neurochemicals,
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.720]   convergent and divergent thinking,
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.680]   we can arrive at a principle.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.140]   And the principle involves a molecule
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:03.220]   that many of you have heard about before, which is dopamine.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.480]   Dopamine is a neuromodulator.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.160]   It's involved in motivation,
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.960]   and it tends to direct our attention to things outside of us,
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.140]   but it's also closely related to convergent thinking
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.060]   and divergent thinking and to the creative process.
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.620]   And therefore, it should come as no surprise
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.020]   that diseases of the nervous system, excuse me,
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.980]   such as bipolar disorder,
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.800]   which we've done an episode all about bipolar disorder,
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.720]   or schizophrenia, or mood disorders
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.760]   that impact the levels of dopamine,
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.860]   either make it way, way too high or way, way too low,
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.520]   strongly impact whether or not people will be creative.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.120]   And I think the short takeaway
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.600]   that makes the most sense in terms of framing this,
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.360]   and we cover this on the episode on bipolar disorder,
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.160]   sometimes called bipolar depression,
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.720]   is that in professions
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.860]   where there's a lot of creativity required
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:51.880]   in order to succeed,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.220]   so again, musicians, composers, artists, et cetera,
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.880]   you tend to find more manic depression,
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   and manic depression, at least in the manic states,
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.600]   the hyperactive states,
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.460]   are correlated with elevated levels of dopamine.
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:10.680]   Likewise, it has been seen over and over throughout history
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.480]   that individuals that have mild forms of schizophrenia
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.640]   or even full-blown schizophrenia,
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.920]   many famous painters, for instance, or musicians,
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.580]   they are known to have elevated levels of dopamine,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:22.740]   and they are quite creative.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.500]   Now, that doesn't mean everybody who's creative
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.280]   has elevated levels of dopamine,
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.500]   although it's likely that their levels of dopamine
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.620]   are at least not diminished,
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.440]   and it doesn't mean that non-creative people
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.560]   have low levels of dopamine,
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.780]   so don't get carried away with the interpretation here,
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.880]   but the point is this.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:41.080]   Dopamine levels strongly relate to the probability
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.960]   that you can engage in convergent and divergent thinking,
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.840]   and they do so in the following way.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.000]   When dopamine levels are high,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.140]   divergent thinking is more likely.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.260]   That is, when people have a lot of dopamine
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.880]   circulating in their system,
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.460]   they tend to be very expansive with their ideas.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.680]   They tend to brainstorm a lot.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.520]   They tend to be comfortable and even want to,
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.260]   or reflexively, throw out a lot of ideas
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:07.860]   that sometimes even seem a little disconnected.
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.680]   Some people might think of this as kind of
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.520]   attention deficit, but it's not.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:16.040]   It's really the idea of throwing out disparate ideas, right?
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.440]   You know, you hear sometimes, you know,
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.360]   you throw things against the wall and see what sticks.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.960]   Well, these people, that's obviously an analogy,
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.120]   but people are throwing lots of things against the wall
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.240]   and seeing what stick,
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.480]   and then seeing how the things that stick fit together.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.700]   That's divergent thinking,
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.600]   and elevations in dopamine
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.020]   tend to increase divergent thinking.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.160]   However, they tend to do this
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.680]   in kind of an inverted U-shape way.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.860]   For those of you that are watching on YouTube,
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.320]   I'm just drawing kind of a hump, obviously,
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.620]   and for those of you listening,
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.860]   just imagine a U, the shape of a letter U,
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.680]   and then just flip it upside down so it looks like a bump.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.660]   Turns out that when dopamine levels are very low,
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.820]   there's a low probability of divergent thinking.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.080]   When dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.140]   there's a high level or probability of divergent thinking.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.480]   But when dopamine levels go very, very high,
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.480]   then there's, again, a reduction in divergent thinking.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.840]   In other words, there's a kind of a sweet spot
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.320]   of elevated dopamine for divergent thinking.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.140]   And again, divergent thinking is critical
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.480]   for the creativity process,
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.600]   because creativity by definition
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.200]   is taking a novel set of ideas
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.200]   and arranging them in a particular way,
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:25.180]   or taking existing ideas and arranging them in a novel way,
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:28.120]   that then you eventually converge on some new product,
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.720]   new idea, new song, et cetera.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.960]   Now, convergent thinking follows a very different pattern.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.480]   When dopamine levels are high,
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.560]   convergent thinking is not very likely.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.320]   And when dopamine levels are low,
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.060]   convergent thinking is very likely.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:47.040]   So here, using arguably a very reductionist view,
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.560]   we're looking at all of this thing of,
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.400]   we're calling creativity
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.680]   through a very neurosciency reductionist lens,
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.600]   we can say this.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.500]   The creative process involves going into a state
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.160]   where you're willing to consider a lot of options,
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.940]   many of which seem distantly
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.660]   or not even connected to one another.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:04.940]   And dopamine facilitates that divergent thinking state
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.440]   in which you are perfectly happy
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.960]   and in fact experience a kind of a joy or elation,
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.560]   a comfort and a pleasure
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.420]   in organizing all these different ideas
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:19.140]   that to anyone else might seem not that related.
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.200]   But when your dopamine levels are elevated,
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.440]   these all seem like great ideas
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.360]   and that maybe there are connections there, right?
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.400]   You're not accepting all of them as true and valid
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.300]   and interesting and combining them.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.780]   But there's this idea that,
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.640]   it's worth entertaining the possibility,
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.400]   at least for moments.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.020]   And then as dopamine levels drop,
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.800]   there is the process of convergent thinking,
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   which is taking options down off the wall,
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.320]   saying, no, no, that doesn't fit with that,
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.680]   doesn't fit with that, but ah, that fits with that.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.760]   And that can work, that feels right or sounds right
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.240]   or looks right.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.020]   That's the creativity process.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.820]   And so I think this is not just important
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.280]   for understanding cannabis,
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.720]   which we'll get back to in a moment,
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.080]   but it's important for understanding creativity
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.820]   and brain states in general.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.700]   Brain states are not, as we would say,
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.600]   a square wave function.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.640]   You don't just drop into a trench of creativity.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.680]   Creativity is not an event, it's a process.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.120]   And what I'm telling you is that it's a process
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.080]   that involves divergent thinking and consideration,
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080]   a lot of different ideas.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.920]   That's correlated with high, but not too high dopamine.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.640]   And then one has to transition into a state
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:25.800]   of convergent thinking,
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.300]   which is really homing in on the ideas
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.020]   that seem to have validity or that could have validity
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.380]   and getting rid of everything else.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.480]   And that's associated with low dopamine.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.680]   It's more about logical implementation and consideration
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.880]   as opposed to thinking about and considering everything.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.960]   So let's now return to the question of whether or not
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.960]   cannabis and its different components increase creativity.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.240]   And when you look at the literature on this,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.840]   you find studies that very clearly point to a yes,
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.640]   it increases creativity.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.480]   And it's not surprising, therefore,
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.960]   that cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.360]   that is dopamine levels, in certain brain areas,
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.720]   in particular brain areas involved in thinking and planning.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.400]   Okay, so cannabis increases dopamine in these areas,
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.960]   elevated dopamine increases divergent thinking,
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.280]   and divergent thinking is associated with creativity.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.360]   And there are studies that support the idea
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.220]   that cannabis can increase creativity.
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.700]   However, there are at least as many studies
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.720]   that say that cannabis does not increase creativity,
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:30.060]   that cannabis increases consideration of multiple ideas,
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:33.820]   perhaps through elevation of dopamine and related systems,
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:36.840]   but that ultimately the ideas that converge from that
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.340]   are not truly creative ideas.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.680]   At least they don't make the criteria
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.880]   for creative brainstorming and extraction of ideas
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.480]   that are truly novel, so it doesn't increase creativity.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.040]   So which one is it?
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.920]   Well, fortunately, there's an entirely distinct set
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.420]   of literature that has taken all the other literature
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.320]   into consideration, and here's where we arrive.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.120]   So there's a really nice study that explored creativity
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.760]   in cannabis users, and we will provide a link to this study.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.600]   First author is Emily LaFrance, and the title of the paper,
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.740]   it's somewhat amusing in its own right,
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.760]   which is, it starts with a question.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.540]   Inspired by Mary Jane, of course,
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.980]   Mary Jane being one of the kind of old school versions
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.380]   of ways of talking about cannabis or marijuana.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.620]   Nowadays, people refer to it mainly as pot,
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.400]   has other names too, of course.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.880]   And the title of the paper is Inspired by Mary Jane,
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.200]   Mechanisms Underlying Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.820]   And I really like this study for a couple of reasons.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:35.820]   First of all, they looked at people who did not use cannabis
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:38.660]   as well as people who use cannabis.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.920]   So they had two different groups,
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.760]   but they did not evaluate creativity of the cannabis users
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.200]   while they were under the influence of cannabis.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.520]   They looked at the level of creativity
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.560]   in these cannabis users
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.380]   when they were not under the influence of cannabis
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.280]   and asked whether or not their ability to be creative
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.680]   was enhanced by cannabis.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.840]   Now we're going to compare this to studies
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.880]   in which people come into the laboratory
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.040]   and actually use cannabis,
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.560]   and then they evaluate creativity under that context.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.660]   But this study has some unique takeaways
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.880]   that I think are really interesting.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.400]   First of all, they did, yes,
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.880]   see evidence for enhanced creativity.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:18.360]   And when I say enhanced creativity,
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.740]   I mean within the context of this divergent thinking thing
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.340]   that I talked about a moment ago.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:25.580]   And when I say enhanced,
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.020]   I mean significantly greater than in non-users,
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.940]   so people that don't use cannabis.
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.120]   So right now I can imagine that all the cannabis users
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.160]   are cheering, yes, cannabis increases creativity,
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.760]   makes people more creative than they would be otherwise.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.420]   Well, this is interesting.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.960]   We have to ask ourselves how that was accomplished.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.640]   And it turns out that one of the major ways
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.600]   in which it was accomplished is that cannabis users,
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.040]   even if they are not under the influence of cannabis,
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.680]   are far more open to novel ideas,
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.960]   and they have a more explorative and sort of reduced anxiety
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.440]   or I should say lower anxiety mode of thinking
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.840]   when they explore novel ideas,
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.800]   which is essential for divergent thinking.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.860]   So they observe both enhanced divergent and convergent
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:12.920]   creative type thinking in cannabis users.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:16.440]   And the source of that, they conclude,
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.500]   is, and here I'll just quote,
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:21.280]   "Cannabis users' higher levels of openness to experience
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.740]   are responsible for their enhanced self-reported creativity
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.040]   and convergent thinking test performance."
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:29.800]   So it's not necessarily that cannabis is increasing
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.100]   the capacity of the brain areas
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.920]   that are associated with creativity,
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.920]   but rather cannabis appears to be increasing in openness
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.480]   and probably doing that in part through lowering anxiety
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.580]   in particular people.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:48.600]   And that openness is leading to inclusion of more ideas
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.160]   during the divergent thinking process, right?
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.300]   They're willing to consider throwing up more things
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.920]   on the wall to see if they stick, so to speak.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.320]   So in their conclusions, they have a really nice statement.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.160]   Again, I'll just read from the paper
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.320]   because they said it better than I ever could.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:05.000]   Quote, "While mainstream media has propagated the idea
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.440]   that cannabis expands the mind and enhances creativity,
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.960]   our results show the link between cannabis and creativity
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.640]   is largely a spurious correlation."
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.040]   Meaning that it's not the case
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.260]   that cannabis increases creativity.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:23.660]   But, and I inserted the but in this quote,
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:28.560]   "But driven by differences in personality
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.600]   that are related to cannabis use.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.520]   For example, openness to experience
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.240]   that are related to both cannabis use
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.780]   and augmented creativity."
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.680]   This is a real chicken egg argument.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.840]   What do I mean by that?
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.560]   What I mean is this paper finds
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.040]   that people who are more open to experience
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.320]   are more likely to use cannabis
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.920]   and people who use cannabis
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.440]   are going to be more open to new experiences.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.840]   And that combination of features, openness to experience
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.440]   and what that openness to new experiences brings
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.680]   enhances the convergent and divergent thinking
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:06.760]   that is characteristic of the creative process.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:10.040]   So in short, cannabis increases creativity
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.420]   but through changes in personality
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.720]   that tap into the creative process
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.300]   rather than directly impacting the neural circuits
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:21.080]   that for instance, turn on creativity.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   And I have to say this study is really important
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.360]   because by exploring cannabis users
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.880]   not while under the influence of cannabis,
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.960]   they were able to tap into this very important
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.060]   what I believe to be fact.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.520]   Because if you think about a study
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.440]   in which you would have one group using cannabis
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.080]   and another group not using cannabis
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.880]   and then you give them some tasks that taps into creativity,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.360]   you will see effects and very likely you'll see effects
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.680]   where cannabis might even increase divergent convergent
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.040]   thinking and creativity.
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.320]   Those results have actually been published
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.800]   many times before.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.640]   But given the varied effects of cannabis and THC
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.520]   that we talked about earlier
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.620]   through all that complex signaling stuff,
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.920]   you can imagine that there will also be other studies
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:06.040]   and in fact there are where divergent and convergent thinking
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.200]   and creativity is not assisted by cannabis
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.940]   and might even be reduced by ingesting cannabis.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:14.800]   However, if one considers that divergent thinking
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.640]   is absolutely crucial to the creativity process
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.660]   and the range of things that one will explore
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:24.280]   will be enhanced by openness
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.820]   and by reduced levels of anxiety.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.760]   So a willingness to explore different options,
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.180]   some of which might seem completely crazy
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.260]   and cannabis increases the personality types
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.080]   and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.340]   Well, then it makes perfect sense
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.600]   why cannabis would increase creativity
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.280]   in certain individuals, but not directly.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.940]   And this study, the one I just referred to,
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:49.180]   which I should say was published
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.920]   in the journal "Consciousness and Cognition"
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.040]   and again, we'll provide a link to it,
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.800]   did a wonderful job of teasing out this impact of cannabis
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.280]   on personality, which then impacts creativity.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.420]   So if somebody asks you or if you're wondering
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:06.560]   or if you feel like cannabis increases creativity,
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.080]   in some sense, the answer is yes,
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.260]   but the answer is yes because of the ways
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.120]   that it shapes openness to new ideas
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.980]   and can, I should say can because not in everybody,
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.180]   but can in some individuals reduce anxiety.
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.960]   What this means is that if you are somebody
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   who experiences anxiety or increased levels of focus
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.880]   from cannabis, regardless of the strain,
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.960]   and here I have to imagine people
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.300]   are exploring different strains
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.500]   if they're exploring them at all,
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:36.840]   exploring different modes of delivery,
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.700]   smoking or ingestible, et cetera.
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:41.640]   If you're somebody who experiences anxiety,
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.160]   it's very likely that you won't have the increased openness
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.420]   to experience and divergent ideas
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.840]   that will facilitate creativity.
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.040]   However, if you are somebody
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.700]   who achieves heightened levels of relaxation
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:57.580]   and reduced levels of anxiety from cannabis,
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:00.400]   regardless of which strain we happen to be talking about,
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.060]   well, then yes, it will position you
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.720]   to be in a heightened state of creativity,
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.520]   at least as defined by convergent and divergent thinking.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.160]   One of the more characteristic,
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.320]   or I should say stereotype qualities
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.380]   of people that smoke a lot of marijuana
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:18.100]   or ingest cannabis through other means
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.320]   is their changed patterns of speech.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   In fact, there's a kind of a lore in the clinical realm
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.400]   that you can predict or get some strong indication
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.720]   as to whether or not somebody is a cannabis user
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:34.040]   or a pot smoker based on their voice
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.200]   and their particular tone of voice
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.240]   and their lack of inflection.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.680]   There's a lot of speculation here,
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.360]   but fortunately it's been studied.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.640]   So I'd like to discuss now
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:46.720]   whether or not cannabis can impact patterns of speech,
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.080]   both acutely, meaning while under the influence of cannabis
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.640]   and over time in chronic cannabis users.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.160]   And when I say chronic cannabis use,
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.800]   I want to be very specific what I mean.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.000]   Chronic cannabis use does not necessarily mean
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.240]   that people are smoking cannabis
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.080]   or ingesting cannabis every day.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.040]   Although certainly if they are,
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.360]   that qualifies as chronic use.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.760]   Chronic use is regular use over time
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.200]   of anywhere from twice a week or more.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.820]   So using cannabis once a month
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:13.320]   would not be considered chronic use,
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.520]   even if it's for many, many years.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.640]   Using cannabis or ingesting cannabis in some way or form
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.400]   twice a week would be considered chronic use.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.240]   And then of course,
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.040]   some of you out there are going to ask me to split hairs
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.560]   and say, well, what if somebody uses it twice a month?
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.860]   Well, listen, the clinical literature
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.460]   and the scientific literature don't get that specific.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:33.320]   And of course there are an infinite number of ways
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.600]   to arrange one's cannabis use,
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.440]   everything from zero, none at all,
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.160]   to constantly every day, all day and everywhere in between.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.960]   But think of chronic use as twice a week or more.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.600]   Think of occasional use as less than that
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.320]   and realize that within the realm of chronic use, excuse me,
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.360]   that or more can be anywhere from twice a week
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.080]   to every day to just in the evenings, et cetera.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.480]   The effects of chronic use of cannabis,
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.800]   as I just defined it, on speech have been studied
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.560]   because of this characteristic drawing out
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.660]   of certain syllables, a slowing of speech,
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:19.100]   and in many cases, a total change or alteration
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.140]   in the way that people speak and use language,
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:25.620]   both when under the influence of cannabis
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:28.020]   and when not under the influence of cannabis
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.840]   if they are chronic users.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.900]   And here, we really want to distinguish between THC and CBD
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.620]   and just make it really simple and say that CBD
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:41.260]   is not responsible for most of the psychoactive effects
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.780]   of cannabis, whereas THC is.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:45.480]   And again, the ratio of CBD to THC
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.160]   is going to be relevant there,
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.000]   but let's just think about cannabis and THC
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.840]   as one in the same for this portion of the discussion,
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:53.680]   realizing that, of course,
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.640]   they are not exactly the same thing.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.220]   There's an excellent study entitled
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.680]   "Adults with History of Recreational Cannabis Use
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.840]   Have Altered Speech Production."
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:02.840]   And we will provide a link to that.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.040]   First author, Adam Vogel, really liked this paper.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.540]   It was published in the journal "Drug and Alcohol Dependence."
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.860]   We will provide a link to it for you
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.320]   if you'd like to peruse it in more detail.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.640]   The title itself,
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.920]   "Adults with a History of Recreational Cannabis Use
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.040]   Have Altered Speech Production,"
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.260]   tells you pretty much everything you need to know,
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.700]   except there's some important nuance in here
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.820]   because, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:30.140]   people who smoke sativa varieties of cannabis
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:34.400]   oftentimes will become more talkative, much more talkative.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.300]   However, whether or not people tend to rely
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:42.300]   on sativa cannabis use or indica cannabis use,
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.920]   there is a very consistent finding
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.280]   that people who are chronic users,
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.040]   again, twice a week or more,
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.700]   recreational use or medicinal use,
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:54.320]   undergo pretty profound changes in the way that they speak,
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.880]   but in a very specific set of ways.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.720]   Now, first of all,
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.600]   the changes in speech shouldn't surprise us at all
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.700]   because both sativa varieties of cannabis
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:08.100]   and indica varieties of cannabis
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:10.800]   impact those brain centers involved in movement,
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:11.980]   the basal ganglia.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.660]   Remember the go/no-go circuitry,
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.480]   the circuitry that makes you want to do things
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.080]   and the circuitry that makes you want to withhold action,
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:21.040]   and it tends to shift the body and brain
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.680]   toward more inaction.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.180]   And cannabis impacts CB1 receptors in the cerebellum,
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.120]   which is involved in motor planning, execution, and balance.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.000]   So regardless of whether or not people are using cannabis
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.520]   of the sativa or the indica variety,
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.460]   there are disruptions in motor circuitry.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.900]   And as you may have heard,
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.480]   if you listen to our episode with Rockefeller professor,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.040]   Dr. Eric Jarvis, who works on speech and movement,
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.640]   speech is movement, right?
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.160]   The movements of the mouth, the movements of the hands,
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.840]   those are intimately related in terms of our speech.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:58.920]   In fact, the centers of the brain involved in hand movements
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.440]   are part of the speech areas and vice versa.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.180]   Eric actually pointed out that if you put your hands
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.040]   behind your back,
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.280]   provided you normally do have use of your hands,
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.280]   it actually will reduce your fluidity of speech.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.480]   And so I'm going to put them back in front of me now.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.280]   The point is smoking marijuana or consuming marijuana
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.520]   by edible changes one's speech
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.040]   and does in a very specific way.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:26.660]   And in this study by Adam Vogel and colleagues,
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:30.460]   they explored a huge different variety of aspects of speech.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:32.640]   And this can be done using spectral processing,
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.180]   which is, you know, fancy nerd speak
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.440]   for looking at how much inflection there is
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.720]   or looking at how long people hold vowels
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:39.860]   or consonants, et cetera.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:40.820]   And again, these are people
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.800]   not under the influence of cannabis,
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.680]   but rather people who tend to be under the influence
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.200]   of cannabis when not participating in the study.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.360]   In other words, chronic recreational cannabis users.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.680]   So what are the two major shifts that cannabis causes
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.080]   on our patterns of speech?
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.920]   Well, the first one is a change
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.900]   in what's called spectral tilt.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:03.740]   And that's fancy nerd speak for vocal effort and intensity.
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:06.720]   So I'm not a pot smoker, I confess,
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.840]   but if I were to say the sentence,
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.420]   vocal effort and intensity
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.180]   are important components of speech.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.940]   That's the way I would say that sentence
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:20.500]   if I was striving to enunciate very carefully
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.180]   and to accent certain words and syllables.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:28.460]   A pot smoker or somebody who uses recreational cannabis
[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:32.500]   fairly often would have reduced spectral tilt,
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.940]   AKA vocal effort and intensity,
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:39.220]   and might say spectral tilt is vocal effort and intensity,
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.440]   and it differed between groups
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:41.660]   and appeared to change in line
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:44.860]   with the duration of abstinence from cannabis use.
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.080]   That I think is not a far cry
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.520]   from the change in spectral tilt that they observed here.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.080]   In addition, there are changes in verbal timing,
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.620]   that is pronunciation of words
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:00.220]   and accenting particular syllables of words
[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:04.700]   in people that consume cannabis or smoke cannabis.
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:09.300]   So rather than emphasize particular words within a sentence,
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.260]   so again, I'll just use a sentence from the paper
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.500]   so that you can gain more knowledge from the paper.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:16.020]   Cannabis, and I'll say it the way that I would say it
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.960]   since I'm not a cannabis user.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.260]   Cannabis, marijuana,
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.540]   is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world
[01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:26.380]   with approximately 4% of adults age 15 to 64 years
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:27.660]   reporting recent use.
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:30.100]   And the citation is from the United Nations Office
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:33.020]   on Drugs and Crime 2019.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.020]   So that would be the way
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:35.900]   that I would typically read that sentence.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:38.420]   And having gone into the data on this paper
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:41.140]   and of course evaluated references therein
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:44.180]   and listened to some of the spectral analysis
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:46.180]   that they include as data,
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.940]   you can literally go into these papers online
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:51.220]   and hear recordings of people who are cannabis users
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.780]   or non-cannabis users.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:55.300]   And I'll try and give you a clear sense
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.720]   without picking an extreme example
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   of how somebody who's a fairly consistent
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.520]   or even occasional cannabis user
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.260]   might read that very same sentence.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:07.700]   Cannabis, marijuana,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.380]   is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:14.420]   with approximately 4% of adults age 15 to 64 years
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:15.860]   reporting recent use.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.340]   And the citation comes from the United Nation Office
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.960]   on Drugs and Crime 2019.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.440]   Now you'll notice that wasn't a dramatic difference.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.440]   And of course I could have taken the liberty
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.760]   to pick an extreme example
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.480]   of the sort that they did occasionally observe
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.700]   in evaluating subjects for this paper.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.060]   I could have said something like cannabis,
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.400]   marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug,
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.640]   but frankly that would have been
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.340]   selecting an outlier example.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.200]   And I don't want to do that.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.680]   I don't want to skew the data as they say.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:47.040]   Rather, if you heard the first time I read the sentence
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.280]   and the second time I read the sentence,
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.880]   what's mainly different is the difference
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.200]   in the amount of annunciation
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.080]   and accenting of particular words
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.480]   and symbols within a sentence.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.360]   So the total content that's delivered is exactly the same.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.560]   And while I wasn't measuring my pace,
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:07.360]   the overall rate of communication is essentially the same,
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.400]   but there's less sort of lilting
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.240]   and falling of the voice and less accenting.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.320]   That's the major consistent effect of cannabis use.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.320]   Now, of course, there are examples of people
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.640]   who are using a lot of cannabis
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.720]   and it impacts brain centers involved in movement and speech.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.840]   So much so that they really do have
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.560]   the really drawn out kind of nah.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.080]   And oftentimes this will be detected in the laugh.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.840]   You know, there's this sort of stereotypical stoner laugh
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.980]   as it's sometimes called,
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:36.720]   rather than say ha ha ha or that's a fake laugh, obviously.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:37.860]   It's hard to make myself laugh
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:38.920]   if something's not actually funny.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.360]   I'll have to think of something funny.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.480]   When people will say ha,
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.340]   like that's a bit more of the way I might laugh,
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.820]   like ha, sort of the inspiratory laugh or the ha,
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.480]   which is expiratory laugh.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.200]   People who use cannabis chronically
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.180]   will often do the ah, right?
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:54.560]   Which is sort of the back of the throat, ah.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.280]   It's sort of this,
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:58.400]   it's neither inspiratory nor expiratory laugh.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.220]   And believe it or not,
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:01.440]   there's an entire literature on inspiratory inhaling
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.000]   versus expiratory laughs.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.720]   And there's also a literature on cannabis
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.400]   altering the pattern of inspiratory and expiratory laughs.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.780]   It almost sounds like a sarcastic laugh
[01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:14.320]   when in fact they may not be feeling sarcastic at all.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.880]   And I have a very close friend and colleague
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.240]   who's a phenomenal neurosurgeon and neuroscientist
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.480]   by the name of Dr. Eddie Chang.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.800]   He's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF and his lab.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.820]   And him are expert in the study
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:29.560]   of neuroscience controlling language and speech.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:34.100]   And he often tells me that he can predict
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.240]   with almost certainty whether or not somebody
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.220]   is a regular cannabis user
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:42.280]   based not just on the patterns of speech that they use,
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.300]   but even just by recording specific neurons in their brain
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.840]   that underlie the laugh reflex
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.440]   and certain patterns of speech.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.540]   So this idea that cannabis use changes your ability
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:55.820]   to speak and enunciate clearly does appear to be true.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.560]   And the stereotype that cannabis use
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.640]   tends to create more of a drawl
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.800]   or kind of a, if you will, a laziness in the laugh
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:08.000]   and some of the reflexive enunciations that people use
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.260]   does also appear to be true.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:11.940]   And I say all that of course with the caveat
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.020]   that many people out there will know individuals
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.960]   or perhaps you yourselves are individuals
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:22.180]   that may use cannabis, but that have incredible articulation
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:23.300]   probably better than mine
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:24.660]   and better than other people out there
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:25.940]   who speak for a living.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:28.020]   So I'm not saying that 100% of people
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:31.300]   that use cannabis regularly can't speak well or clearly.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.980]   That's simply not what I'm saying.
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.520]   And I don't want to communicate that idea at all.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.740]   But it is the case that people who are regular cannabis users
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:41.300]   are impacting the neural circuits involved in movement.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.100]   Movement also controls speech
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:46.380]   and therefore cannabis is impacting speech.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.780]   Now I'd like to turn our attention to
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:51.100]   whether or not cannabis can increase sexual activity,
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:54.460]   sexual desire and or sexual function.
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:56.400]   So we're going to be talking about libido,
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.300]   about sexual desire and about effects of cannabis
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.600]   on hormones.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.660]   And while this might sound like a discussion
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:06.080]   that's purely oriented towards recreational use of cannabis,
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.380]   that is people using cannabis to heighten
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:12.020]   or increase their sense of arousal for sexual activity,
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:14.540]   it actually ventures into the clinical realm too,
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:17.600]   meaning there have been excellent peer reviewed studies
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.100]   that I'll describe to you in a moment
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:23.060]   exploring the use of cannabis or THC more specifically
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:26.980]   for something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:30.420]   which refers to a persistent or recurrent deficiency
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.740]   or absence of sexual fantasies and thoughts
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:37.300]   and or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity.
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.620]   This is a disorder that is fairly common,
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:41.900]   anywhere from six to 9% of people,
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.580]   both males and females.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:47.580]   It used to be considered higher prevalence in females
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.420]   than in males,
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.760]   but now those numbers seem to be evening out.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.440]   So basically there are anywhere from six to 9%
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.680]   of people out there who have very diminished sexual desire.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.260]   And so a number of those people are interested
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.620]   in figuring out ways to increase
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.260]   their amount of sexual desire.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:07.180]   And of course there are people in the general population
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.660]   who may not have hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.340]   who are interested in using cannabis recreationally
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.580]   in order to increase their desire for
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:18.540]   or their experience of sexual activity.
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:19.860]   Now, first we have to acknowledge
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.780]   that sexual desire and activity
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.060]   is a complex set of processes,
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:27.680]   meaning it's not just one event, sex, the verb,
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.740]   it involves arousal, it involves sex, the verb,
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:35.340]   and it involves a whole set of mindsets and emotional states
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.780]   that vary tremendously between individuals.
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:41.980]   But once again, we can distill out a few basic principles
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:44.380]   and I should emphasize these are by no means
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:46.000]   the only chemicals in neural circuits
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.940]   involved in the sexual arc, as we'll call it,
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:51.720]   desire, the act of sex, et cetera,
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.260]   but they are central to it, they are vital to it.
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:56.980]   They would be considered what I would call necessary
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:58.380]   but not sufficient, okay?
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:00.260]   So there'll be other chemicals involved too,
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.760]   but the main chemicals in neural circuits
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.540]   are those involved in dopamine.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.820]   So the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:08.740]   in particular brain structure called nucleus accumbens,
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.360]   which we'll talk about more in a moment,
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.220]   is vital to all motivated behaviors
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:16.340]   and to the seeking out of all particular types
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:18.960]   of pleasurable experiences and sex is no exception.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.980]   So when we hear that the nucleus accumbens is activated,
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:24.820]   that almost always means that dopamine has been released
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:27.540]   in that area and other areas of the brain and body,
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.500]   and we can consider dopamine central
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:34.500]   to the desire for, pursuit of, and act of sex.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:38.500]   In addition to that, there are molecules like oxytocin,
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.020]   which are involved in pair bonding,
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.140]   and they're going to be neural circuits
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:43.580]   specific to the oxytocin circuitry,
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:47.380]   but in terms of sexual arousal and sexual behavior,
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.100]   it's really the dopamine pathway in this nucleus accumbens,
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:51.840]   which are especially vital.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.540]   That allows us to address the question,
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:59.540]   does cannabis increase, decrease, or have no effect
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:04.660]   on sexual desire and/or the ability to have sex?
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:08.740]   And therein, we will find some very interesting answers
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:12.180]   because once again, it will point to the fact
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:15.940]   that the effects of cannabis on different individuals
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.020]   can be highly divergent,
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:20.260]   meaning in one set of individuals,
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.780]   cannabis will make them far less anxious,
[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:24.380]   and in another set of individuals,
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:26.740]   the same strain of cannabis at the same dosage
[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:28.320]   will make them extremely anxious.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.860]   The same can be said also of sexual activity.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.980]   And this was beautifully illustrated
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:35.880]   in the context of sexual desire
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.820]   in the journal "Psychopharmacology"
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:39.420]   in a paper published in 2017.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:40.860]   The title of this paper
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:44.500]   is "Individual Prolactin Reactivity Modulates Response
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.940]   of Nucleus Accumbens to Erotic Stimuli
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:51.420]   During Acute Cannabis Intoxication, an fMRI Pilot Study."
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:53.580]   So I'll give a little bit of definition
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.700]   to some of the terms in the title
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.620]   that will make it easier for you to understand the paper,
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.100]   but then I'll just march through the results
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:01.820]   because they are very straightforward and easy to understand
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.380]   and very interesting.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:06.540]   fMRI is just functional magnetic resonance imaging.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:09.260]   So basically, subjects in this experiment
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:12.020]   came into the laboratory.
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:16.180]   They were either people who had not used cannabis before
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:19.180]   or who had used cannabis before.
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:20.940]   They were placed into a brain scanner,
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.660]   one of these fMRI devices.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:26.080]   It looks like a tube that people are backed up into,
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:27.460]   and then they can view images in there,
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:28.800]   and their brain can be imaged
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.340]   without having to remove any skull
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.380]   or drill into the skull, no neurosurgery.
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:35.300]   The participants in this study
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:36.860]   were grouped according to whether or not
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:39.600]   they'd experienced any aphrodisiac effects
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.740]   during the intoxication with cannabis.
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.740]   So that would be the first group, group A.
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:45.940]   They literally called it group A for aphrodisiac.
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.060]   And then the second group,
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.820]   and this is the only thing I don't like about this study,
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.300]   is rather than call it group B,
[01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.660]   they called them group non-A,
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:54.700]   which just gets a little confusing.
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:56.420]   So I'll try and simplify all this.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.820]   There are two groups,
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:02.180]   and one group experiences sexual arousal
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:06.260]   when under the influence of cannabis, THC specifically.
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:07.620]   The other group does not.
[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:10.620]   And it turns out this is a very commonly observed
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:14.260]   divergence of effects of cannabis.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.800]   Some people experience a lot of sexual arousal
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.180]   from cannabis and THC in particular,
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.560]   and some people do not.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:24.100]   In fact, they experience suppression of sexual desire.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.940]   And it's always been a little bit mysterious
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:27.940]   as to why that is.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:29.320]   Well, in this study,
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:33.720]   they showed people in both groups erotic images,
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:35.880]   and they measured sexual arousal
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:36.940]   through a number of different measures.
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.840]   We won't go into all that.
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:39.300]   It was largely subjective.
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:40.240]   There've been other studies
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.040]   where they've actually measured things
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:45.800]   like erections in males and vaginal lubrication in females,
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.840]   the so-called autonomic responses
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.240]   that people can't lie about, so to speak,
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.360]   and that tap into other aspects
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:57.640]   of the so-called sexual arousal process.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.760]   In this study, they also took blood samples
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.160]   to look at the concentration of things like cannabinoids.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.440]   So this is a really nice study
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:07.360]   in that they actually measured how much THC
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.660]   was in the bloodstream in different individuals
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:12.400]   who reacted to these erotic stimuli in different ways.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.080]   And they measured hormones,
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.280]   namely cortisol, which is a stress hormone,
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:17.800]   which tends to negatively correlate
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.560]   with sexual arousal and prolactin.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.640]   And the interesting takeaway from the study
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.960]   was that for people,
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.440]   and it didn't matter if it was males or females,
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.800]   'cause they looked at both,
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:35.280]   for people that experienced elevated prolactin levels
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:39.240]   under cannabis intoxication, that's how they referred to it.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.960]   People take cannabis, they measured prolactin.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.900]   Some people had elevated prolactin, some people did not.
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:48.000]   For the people that had elevated levels of prolactin,
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.440]   they did not observe activation of brain areas
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.340]   associated with sexual arousal,
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:56.440]   in this case, the right nucleus accumbens.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:59.640]   So you have two nucleus accumbi, I guess they'd be called,
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:00.800]   one on each side of the brain,
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.520]   and the activation of that brain area
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.520]   is strongly associated with dopamine and with arousal,
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.880]   and sexual arousal in particular in this study.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.000]   And if people had elevated prolactin,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.880]   they did not experience activation of nucleus accumbens,
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.400]   and they did not report feeling sexually aroused
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.320]   to those pictures, at least not to the same degree
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.520]   as the other group.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.620]   So some people's prolactin levels go up
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.680]   when they ingest cannabis,
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:25.880]   and those people do not achieve elevated levels
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:29.360]   of sexual arousal when under the influence of cannabis,
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:32.200]   even if they're looking at erotic stimuli.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.740]   That makes sense because prolactin
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:39.120]   is mutually inhibitory, as we would say.
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.040]   It's kind of in a push-pull with dopamine.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.280]   When dopamine levels are high,
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:44.560]   prolactin levels tend to be low,
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.160]   and when prolactin levels are high,
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.000]   dopamine levels tend to be low.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.540]   The other group, so-called group A,
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:53.480]   that experienced elevated levels of sexual arousal
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.140]   when under the influence of cannabis and viewing erotic
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.880]   stimuli, that group did not show elevated levels
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.800]   of prolactin in response to cannabis.
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.480]   So this, I believe, resolves a longstanding controversy
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:08.760]   in the field, which is,
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.300]   does cannabis increase sexual arousal?
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.280]   Well, it depends.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.220]   If you fall into the category of person
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:18.000]   who has elevated levels of prolactin in response to cannabis,
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.940]   then no, actually cannabis will suppress
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.240]   your sexual response and desire.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.400]   If, however, you are in the category of person
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.840]   that does not have elevated levels of prolactin
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.700]   in response to cannabis,
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:35.080]   well then erotic stimuli can potentially,
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:37.760]   and in fact do, increase sexual arousal
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.320]   in the majority of individuals.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.820]   Now, many of you are probably hearing this
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.400]   and wondering whether or not you fall into
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.860]   one category of individual or another.
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:50.280]   And the key thing here to understand is that
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.100]   levels of prolactin heading into the study
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:56.100]   did not predict, did not predict,
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.140]   whether or not people would respond to cannabis
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:02.300]   with elevated or non-elevated
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.960]   or even reduced levels of sexual arousal.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.700]   It was whether or not people's prolactin levels went up
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:11.700]   or did not go up that predicted whether or not
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:14.680]   their levels of arousal would go up or not.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:17.100]   So if you are somebody who, yes,
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.440]   does experience elevated levels of sexual arousal
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.600]   and function when under the influence of cannabis,
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.160]   well, that's very likely that cannabis
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.880]   does not increase your prolactin levels,
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:30.460]   at least not to a significant degree while you're taking it.
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:33.160]   And if you are somebody who does not experience increases
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.000]   in sexual arousal or function
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.940]   or even diminished sexual arousal and function
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:38.340]   when under the influence of cannabis,
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.400]   it's very likely the cannabis is increasing
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.740]   your levels of prolactin.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:44.320]   Unfortunately, there's no way to know or predict
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:46.360]   based on some other measure.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.080]   I think the outcome measure that is increased
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.540]   or not increased or even reduced sexual arousal
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:54.940]   is really the litmus test by which one can figure that out.
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:57.180]   While we are on the topic of the effects of cannabis
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.340]   on sexual function and hormones like prolactin,
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:02.240]   it's probably worth mentioning that cannabis
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:04.100]   has been studied extensively
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.260]   for its impact on other hormones.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:09.940]   And we can summarize those literature in the following way.
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:12.060]   And here I'm referring to studies only on adults.
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:13.820]   We will talk about the developing brain and body
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:17.380]   in a little bit, but it is very clear
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:22.380]   that smoking cannabis increases prolactin levels.
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:24.440]   Very, very clear.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.840]   Now you might say, didn't you just describe a study
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.480]   about a set of individuals whose prolactin didn't increase
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.120]   and as a consequence,
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.760]   their level of sexual desire went up?
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.520]   Yes, there are a subset of individuals
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.860]   for which that's true.
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.760]   But people who smoke cannabis
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.380]   do experience increases in prolactin.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.140]   And that's especially pronounced in people
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.780]   that smoke cannabis more than twice a week.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:51.500]   So this is important.
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.420]   Prolactin, as I referred to earlier,
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:59.420]   is reciprocal or mutually inhibitory with dopamine.
[01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:01.500]   One way to think about this is in the context
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.600]   of the normal sexual arousal arc,
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.380]   whereby dopamine is increased
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:07.220]   when people are sexually aroused.
[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:10.640]   But then after orgasm, both in males and females,
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.800]   prolactin levels skyrocket.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.340]   This is actually what creates
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.380]   the so-called refractory period for males
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.380]   during which they cannot achieve erection again
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.580]   for some period of time.
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:21.660]   That relates directly
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:25.240]   to how long the prolactin increase lasts, okay?
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:30.220]   Prolactin is also increased in new parents of all species,
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:35.220]   including humans, which at least partially explain
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:38.480]   some of the reported or typical reductions
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.040]   in sexual desire and activity in new parents.
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:43.140]   Now there are other reasons for that too, sleep deprivation,
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:46.960]   but nature is smart and has arranged a set of hormones
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.300]   and circuits in the brain and body
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:50.280]   such that when tending to a newborn
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:53.120]   is the most important thing, it relegates,
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:57.780]   it reduces the importance of producing more children
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.060]   and sexual activity in those moments
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:01.940]   and days and weeks, sometimes longer.
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:04.520]   So when prolactin levels are up, dopamine levels are down.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:06.500]   Smoking marijuana more than twice a week
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:09.020]   significantly increases prolactin.
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:11.340]   There are fewer studies exploring
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:14.260]   whether or not edible marijuana has the same effect,
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:18.180]   although the preliminary evidence suggests that it does not.
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.180]   I get into this in a lot more detail in a future episode,
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:24.100]   all about hormones with Dr. Kyle Gillette,
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:27.100]   who's been on this podcast before, but he verified that,
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:31.260]   and my read of the literature is that the edible forms
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:35.260]   of marijuana, cannabis, probably, again,
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:37.060]   let's put an asterisk next to this,
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:39.400]   but it appears do not have as much
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:41.060]   of a prolactin elevating effect
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:45.000]   and therefore not as much of a dopamine suppressive effect
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.140]   and therefore not as much
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.340]   of a testosterone suppressing effect.
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.000]   And that gets to the issue of testosterone.
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.740]   Does cannabis marijuana suppress testosterone?
[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:55.620]   And this is a very controversial literature and here's why.
[01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:59.700]   Some studies say, yes, it suppresses testosterone
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:02.020]   in males and females.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.700]   And keep in mind that testosterone in females
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:06.380]   is vital for libido and cognitive function,
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:08.380]   cellular repair, et cetera.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:11.340]   So it's not just important in males, of course.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:14.340]   However, other studies say that cannabis
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.500]   does not decrease testosterone.
[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:20.460]   And it seems to depend on whether or not the cannabis
[02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:23.620]   is brought into the system by way of smoking or edible.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:27.160]   And it seems to depend on whether or not the cannabis
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:29.980]   is used chronically by an individual or acutely.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.780]   And here, I just want to zoom out and say that studies
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:35.160]   on cannabis or drugs of any kind in humans
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.220]   are really complicated.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.060]   If you think about it,
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.740]   someone has to come into the laboratory
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:41.420]   and let's say you want to study chronic cannabis use.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.940]   Well, you can't keep them in the laboratory all the time.
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:45.680]   So you have to rely on their self-report
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:47.900]   of how often they use cannabis and in what form.
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.020]   And you can't really control from one individual
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.940]   to the next of how much cannabis and THC
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:52.900]   they're bringing into their system.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:55.620]   One person might smoke cannabis out of a bong
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.620]   and take big, deep lungs full bong inhalations or such.
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:04.560]   Other people might smoke joints.
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:06.100]   Other people might use edibles.
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:08.420]   It becomes very complicated to know what people have done
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:10.300]   and that they're reporting it accurately.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:11.440]   And no joke here,
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.660]   especially if marijuana is impacting
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:14.940]   the short-term memory systems.
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:16.140]   They might not actually remember.
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:18.620]   They might not be tracking it that well.
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:21.460]   Contrast that with studies of the acute use of cannabis
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:24.040]   and THC where people who are not regular users
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.500]   come into the laboratory and now suddenly
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:29.540]   with institutional guidelines and safety protocols
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:31.740]   are under the influence of THC and cannabis.
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:32.940]   Well, now you're dealing with a person
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:37.120]   who may not have experience with the elevated heart rate
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.100]   and blood pressure that's characteristic of cannabis
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.100]   'cause it is a stimulant,
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.060]   at least when initially brought into the system,
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:44.380]   even if it might eventually lead to relaxation.
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:45.780]   So now you've got someone who's anxious
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:48.780]   or somebody who's not anxious, who's deeply relaxed,
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:49.980]   and you're trying to study these effects.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:52.420]   So it's a moving target of sorts.
[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:56.060]   It's very complicated to study marijuana and cannabis
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.780]   and its various derivatives in this way.
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:59.860]   Now you can probably appreciate better
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:03.540]   as to why there's so little nuanced data about sativa
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:07.980]   versus indica versus different ratios of CBD and THC.
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:09.740]   It's really difficult to do these studies
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:10.620]   in the first place.
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:13.340]   That said, the general rules are smoking marijuana
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:14.900]   increases prolactin in men and women,
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:17.260]   which will reduce dopamine and testosterone.
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:19.920]   Smoking marijuana chronically,
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:22.380]   meaning more than twice a week,
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:25.280]   does appear to reduce testosterone significantly
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.580]   and elevate so-called aromatase enzymes,
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:30.480]   which are the enzymes that convert testosterone
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.520]   into estrogen.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:33.740]   This might partially explain the effect
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:36.540]   that occurs in about 35% of males,
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:38.340]   which is gynecomastia,
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:41.060]   which is a development of breast tissue in males,
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.660]   in particular young males
[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:44.500]   who have elevated levels of testosterone
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:47.320]   or who are taking exogenous testosterone
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.300]   for testosterone replacement therapy,
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:51.740]   or if they're taking high doses, anabolic steroids,
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:55.340]   or in females that increase in breast size,
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:58.200]   which is due to additional estrogen
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.900]   from testosterone converted to estrogen.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:01.760]   So it does appear that marijuana and cannabis
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.720]   increase estrogen, reduce testosterone,
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:07.420]   increase prolactin, especially in chronic users.
[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:08.980]   Now, I'm sure that some people out there will say,
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:12.340]   well, their testosterone levels are exceedingly high
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:13.760]   or they are fine,
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:15.420]   meaning the constellation of symptoms
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:18.620]   associated with low testosterone and elevated estrogen
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.120]   are not present in them.
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:25.080]   That probably means one of two things or both.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:27.040]   They either had elevated levels of testosterone
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:28.700]   to begin with, so their ceiling was higher,
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:30.640]   so bringing it down didn't have that much of effect,
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.460]   or that they have very low levels
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.620]   of aromatase in their system.
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:38.160]   There are some anecdotal evidence
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.180]   that smoking particular parts of the marijuana plant,
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:45.380]   in particular the seeds, can increase aromatase
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.380]   in the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:48.500]   I think in the old days,
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.540]   the lore was the seeds make you sterile,
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.660]   and I think that was related to what I just told you,
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:55.780]   this increase in conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:57.560]   There's a vast literature
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.720]   on the effects of cannabis on fertility.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.200]   It does seem, yes, it does seem to alter sperm motility
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:06.600]   and sperm health and function
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:08.800]   when taken chronically more than twice per week,
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:12.100]   in particular high doses of high potency THC.
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:14.280]   This is something we will cover in far more detail
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.720]   on a future episode all about fertility.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:19.540]   And in females, there's an increase in estrogen
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:22.440]   as a consequence of smoking marijuana
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.400]   and increasing prolactin and estrogen in parallel.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.040]   Whether or not that's detrimental isn't clear,
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:33.760]   although I point out that elevated estrogen and prolactin
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:36.160]   can be associated, again, can be associated,
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.640]   not necessarily, and certainly not causative,
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.560]   but can be associated with elevated levels of,
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.580]   or frequency of breast cancer detection.
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:46.040]   So cannabis and its effects on hormones
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:47.600]   are not without consequence.
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:52.120]   There are effects of cannabis on cortisol,
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.640]   in some individuals, it greatly increases cortisol
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:58.000]   due to the anxiety and paranoia it can create,
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.280]   and in other individuals, it reduces cortisol.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:02.200]   Again, we have these divergent effects,
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:03.720]   but I want to be very clear.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:05.920]   The effects on prolactin, meaning elevated prolactin,
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:08.000]   the effects on testosterone, meaning,
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.800]   at least most studies point to reduced levels of testosterone
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:13.880]   and increased estrogen, that seems to be true
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:17.720]   for most all individuals that chronically use cannabis.
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:21.380]   Whereas the effects on cortisol tend to be divergent,
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.640]   cannabis increases cortisol in some individuals
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:25.240]   and decreases cortisol in others.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:28.640]   In general, increases in cortisol that are ongoing
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:31.940]   are not healthy for us, and so on.
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:34.520]   And then of course, there are other effects on hormones,
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:35.920]   and I'll just briefly summarize those,
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.820]   that THC in particular, not CBD, but THC in particular,
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:41.640]   is known to be strongly inhibitory
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:43.940]   for something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:45.960]   This is a hormone that's released from the brain,
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:49.480]   from the hypothalamus, that then feeds onto,
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.640]   or I should say, signals to the pituitary gland,
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:52.980]   which is also near the roof of your mouth,
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:54.460]   a lot of stuff happening near the roof of your mouth,
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.060]   it turns out, biologically,
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:59.200]   and reduced levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.940]   caused by cannabis use, reduced levels of LH,
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.620]   luteinizing hormone, and FSH,
[02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:05.880]   which reduce levels of testosterone
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:10.580]   and sperm production in males, and egg health,
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:14.940]   and ovulation, and menstrual function in females.
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:17.840]   Now, I'm sure there are a number of women out there
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:19.900]   who will say they have perfectly normal menstrual cycles
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:22.100]   despite using cannabis.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:24.500]   I'm certainly not going to dispute that.
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:28.140]   But if you are somebody who's trying to maximize fertility,
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:30.820]   or regulate, or balance hormones,
[02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:34.140]   marijuana and cannabis reduces GnRH,
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:38.620]   that is the gonadotropin-release from the hypothalamus,
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.700]   and thereby reduces luteinizing hormone
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:42.180]   and follicle-stimulating hormone,
[02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:43.820]   which are released from the pituitary
[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:45.460]   and travel in the bloodstream
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:48.560]   to support normal ovarian function and health,
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:51.080]   and normal testicular function and health
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.200]   in females and males, respectively.
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.300]   Up until now, I've been discussing the biological
[02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:57.920]   and psychological effects of cannabis.
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:59.400]   Now, I'd like to shift our attention
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:02.500]   to some of the negative health effects of cannabis,
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:05.440]   and shine light on some of the individuals
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.860]   or groups out there that need to be especially wary of,
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:11.700]   and probably avoid cannabis use entirely,
[02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:16.180]   including ingestion of cannabis by way of edible.
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:17.300]   And I frame things that way
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:20.060]   because I think there is an increasingly large number
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:22.620]   of people out there that appreciate
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:27.320]   that smoking tobacco or smoking cannabis,
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:31.800]   vaping tobacco, yes, vaping tobacco or vaping cannabis,
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:35.900]   each and all have negative health consequences
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:38.860]   on the lungs and on the so-called endothelial cells
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:41.200]   of the body, the cells that make up the vasculature,
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.360]   the capillaries and blood vessels.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.120]   If you don't already know this,
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:48.600]   I'll make it very clear and I'll make it very brief.
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:53.440]   Whether or not you smoke or vape tobacco or cannabis,
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.240]   you are severely impairing the function
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:58.860]   of endothelial cells that make up the capillaries
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:01.160]   and blood vessels of your brain and body.
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:05.800]   And that is known to decrease cognitive capacity over time,
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:07.600]   increase probability of strokes,
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:11.000]   severely impact lung function,
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.360]   and also lead to things like peripheral neuropathies.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.280]   It leads to sexual dysfunction
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:19.680]   because of lack of blood flow to the genitals,
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:22.480]   can lead to other aspects of reproductive damage,
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:25.080]   including to the ovaries and testes.
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:27.200]   Essentially, there is no other way to state it
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:30.020]   except that smoking and vaping
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:32.480]   have negative health consequences
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:35.620]   that are independent of the substances
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:38.980]   that people are trying to get into their bloodstream
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:40.280]   by smoking or vaping.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:41.960]   So people smoke and vape tobacco
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:44.160]   and people smoke and vape cannabis.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:45.640]   And in both cases,
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.000]   if we just set aside the direct effects of tobacco
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.420]   and the direct effects of cannabis,
[02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:56.060]   we can confidently say that the process of smoking,
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:57.760]   of inhaling smoke into the lungs,
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.680]   and yes, also vaping,
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.680]   bringing the chemicals that transport nicotine,
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.120]   or in this case, cannabis into the lungs by way of vaping,
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:11.500]   are both severely detrimental to endothelial cells.
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:14.380]   I think a few years ago when vaping wasn't as prominent,
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:16.360]   there was this question and this idea
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.840]   that maybe vaping was going to be far healthier
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.640]   or at least not as bad as smoking,
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:24.880]   but now we can see a huge number
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:26.460]   of negative health effects of vaping,
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.200]   some of which are distinct from the effects of smoking.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.320]   So if you'd like more information on smoking versus vaping,
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:34.280]   please see the episode that I did on nicotine.
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.080]   We will also do an entire episode
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.600]   all about vaping in the future,
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:41.360]   but there's really no way to slice it and dice it
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:42.600]   or candy code it.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.560]   The fact of the matter is that smoking has clear
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:48.080]   and severe negative health consequences,
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.480]   regardless of whether or not you're smoking tobacco
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.820]   or cannabis, THC,
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:57.780]   and vaping has negative health consequences,
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:09:59.400]   whether or not you're using the vape
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.720]   to bring in nicotine or THC
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:04.240]   or some combination of THC and CBD.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:05.560]   That's simply the way it is.
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:07.680]   With that said, now I'd like to focus our attention
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:10.480]   on the direct effects that cannabis has,
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:15.160]   either by way of THC action or by way of CBD action
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.240]   in terms of positive or negative health effects
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:19.200]   on the brain and body.
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:22.920]   And we're going to explore that first as a function of age.
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:26.080]   And the reason we're going to do that is related to a fact
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.960]   that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:31.520]   which is that the CB1 and the CB2 receptors,
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:36.520]   the two receptors for cannabis to which THC and CBD and CBN
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:40.780]   and all other psychoactive compounds in cannabis bind to,
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:45.320]   to have their actions, are present throughout development.
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:46.160]   Believe it or not,
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:49.340]   they are present very soon after conception
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:53.560]   and the CB1 and CB2 receptors actually play a critical role
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.760]   in the development of the fetus.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:58.400]   Now you might wonder why that is
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.400]   because of course the developing fetus
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:02.560]   doesn't necessarily expect to see cannabis
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.840]   or to be exposed to cannabis and THC and CBD.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.600]   But as you recall, endogenous cannabinoids are present
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:14.320]   in the adult brain and body and endogenous cannabinoids,
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.920]   it turns out, are also present in the developing fetus.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:19.560]   In fact, endogenous cannabinoids are present
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:22.180]   at much greater levels than the developing fetus
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:25.840]   than they are after a child is born.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.800]   And levels of endogenous cannabinoids
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:30.220]   actually go down across development.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:31.520]   I find this really interesting.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.060]   What this means is that endogenous cannabinoids
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:37.040]   and activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.320]   are an integral part of neural development.
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:42.200]   And this is going to become especially relevant
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.080]   in considering whether or not pregnant mothers
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:48.180]   should or should not use cannabis or CBD.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.240]   And it also points to some very interesting biology
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:54.280]   in terms of how the brain develops
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.640]   and how the body develops.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.920]   Now the development of the brain and nervous system and body
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:01.140]   is a fascinating and vast literature,
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.100]   certainly far too vast to cover in today's episode,
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.860]   especially at this late hour, as it were.
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:08.780]   But we will have a future episode
[02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:10.840]   all about brain development.
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:13.720]   In terms of the effects of cannabis,
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:17.340]   it's sufficient to say that cannabinoid receptors
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:21.160]   are present and active in the developing fetus.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:23.460]   They are present and active in the newborn.
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.000]   They are present and active in adolescents.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.080]   And across that time from conception until adolescence,
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.820]   endogenous cannabinoids are mainly responsible
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:35.940]   for the actions of those cannabinoid receptors.
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:37.900]   During that time, the cannabinoid receptors
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:39.780]   are having very specific effects
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:42.320]   that are distinct from their effects later in life.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:44.160]   And those effects can largely be explained
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:45.500]   in terms of neural development.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:49.160]   Again, we don't have time for an entire lecture on this now,
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:51.600]   but during development,
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:54.280]   your body was a collection of a bunch of cells.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:55.920]   It's actually called a blastula,
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.260]   which means a ball of cells.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:59.700]   And then those cells actually have to grow out connections
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:01.380]   and duplicate themselves.
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:03.240]   And this is a very interesting process
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:06.120]   by which neurons initially are situated far apart,
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:07.680]   and then they grow out connections
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.000]   and make contacts with one another.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.300]   They remove certain connections
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:13.260]   depending on what kind of life events you're exposed to.
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:15.520]   If you have a wonderful event early in life
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.480]   or a traumatic early life,
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.340]   those connections change, et cetera.
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:21.840]   The important point for today's discussion
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.080]   is that the CB1 receptor in particular
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:28.680]   is expressed on every neuron in the developing brain
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:30.020]   and has been shown to be important
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:33.080]   for every aspect of neural development,
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.160]   from the proliferation of cells,
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.500]   meaning getting enough cells to create a brain,
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:40.040]   to the outgrowth of the so-called axons,
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:43.220]   the little wires that connect up neurons with one another,
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:45.720]   to the steering, the direction
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:50.600]   which those axons go in development, which is essential.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.200]   And even so far as to explain the connections
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.760]   that form between neurons, the so-called synapses,
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.660]   and then how those synapses work.
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:02.920]   So the basic statement here is that endogenous cannabinoids
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:05.080]   and CB1 receptor activation are critical
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.040]   for every aspect of brain wiring and development.
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.120]   With that in mind,
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.320]   the statement I'm about to make is absolutely terrifying,
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:14.160]   at least to me,
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.000]   and frankly, it should be terrifying to you as well.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.720]   And the statement is the current statistics
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.720]   on cannabis use in pregnant mothers is absolutely shocking.
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:30.080]   The most recent survey of pregnant mothers
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.720]   in the United States show that 15%, one five,
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:37.620]   15% of pregnant mothers report using cannabis
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:39.200]   in some form or another,
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:43.840]   either smoking it or more likely ingestion of an edible,
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:46.160]   because they are aware of the negative effects of smoking
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.180]   on the developing fetus,
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:52.100]   ingestion of an edible to increase THC and/or CBD
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:53.540]   during pregnancy.
[02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:55.340]   Which to me, I have to say,
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:15:00.340]   as a developmental neurobiologist is, frankly, it's scary.
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:03.540]   It's absolutely scary because that CB1 receptor
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:06.340]   is not just a minor player in neural development,
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:09.440]   it is absolutely central to every critical aspect
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.500]   of brain wiring and development.
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.940]   Now, the long-term implications
[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:15.740]   or even the short-term implications of this 15%
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:18.880]   of mothers self-reporting the use of cannabis
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:22.160]   at some point during pregnancy are not yet known.
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.700]   This is, as we would say, an experiment that's ongoing,
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:28.560]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out these data
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:31.400]   and just implore you, please, please, please,
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.300]   if you are pregnant or considering getting pregnant,
[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:35.440]   you're a cannabis user, whether or not you're using edibles,
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:37.040]   if you're a CBD user,
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:43.040]   please do whatever is necessary to not ingest cannabis
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:47.760]   or smoke cannabis or ingest CBD during pregnancy.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:50.080]   Now, there may be certain clinical indications
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.300]   by which your physician and your OB-GYN
[02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:56.340]   and the pediatrician that will eventually be the pediatrician
[02:15:56.340 --> 02:16:00.700]   for your child will prescribe CBD,
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:02.420]   although it's hard to imagine what those are.
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:07.340]   I contacted a number of different pediatricians and OB-GYNs
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:10.460]   and not a single one said they would ever suggest
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:12.940]   and in fact would strongly discourage their patients
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:15.980]   from using cannabis during pregnancy.
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:20.900]   But I think that the advent of edible forms of cannabis
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:25.820]   and the combination of THC and CBD in certain products
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:28.780]   and the fact that most people view CBD as safer
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:32.100]   because it does not include as, or does not have,
[02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:35.180]   I should say, the psychoactive effects that THC does
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:39.580]   has led to a situation where you have 15%
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:41.340]   of pregnant mothers using cannabis
[02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:43.100]   at some point during pregnancy
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:45.580]   and maybe even frequently throughout pregnancy.
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:47.280]   And the effects on the developing fetus
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:49.020]   are completely unknown,
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:54.020]   but recall that cannabis and THC and CBD out-compete,
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:56.860]   meaning they park in the receptor
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:58.600]   for endogenous cannabinoids
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.160]   and prevent endogenous cannabinoids
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:04.500]   from having their normal level and pattern of action.
[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.060]   So this is absolutely critical.
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:08.560]   I cannot encourage you enough, or rather I should say,
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.720]   I cannot discourage enough the use of cannabis
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:17.500]   and any related compounds in cannabis, edible or smoked,
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:21.160]   certainly not smoked, but even edible during pregnancy.
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.420]   And certainly in breastfeeding, lactating mothers,
[02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:26.400]   the same is also true.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:30.000]   Recall that cannabis and THC and CBD
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.300]   are incredibly lipophilic.
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:35.800]   They are fat soluble and they get into cells very readily
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:37.240]   and they cross the blood brain barrier,
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:39.700]   they cross the blood placental barrier.
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:41.540]   So when I encountered this statistic,
[02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:43.500]   I had to kind of wipe my eyes a few times.
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.700]   I could not believe it.
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:46.820]   And yet I cross-checked that number
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:47.920]   with a few other studies.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.740]   A few others have come in a little bit lower
[02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:51.940]   at somewhere like 13 to 14%,
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:53.300]   and a few have come in a little bit higher,
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:57.380]   but the average of 15% is both striking and shocking.
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:17:59.380]   So I don't know how to make the message more clear.
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:00.540]   I hope that is clear.
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:05.220]   Please do not use any cannabis, THC,
[02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:09.320]   or related things, including CBD, smoked or edible,
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:12.860]   if you're pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:15.220]   Now we are at the point where we need to consider
[02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:17.120]   some of the negative health effects of cannabis
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.620]   that have been well-documented in peer-reviewed studies.
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:20.900]   And before I do this,
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:22.660]   I want to return to a point that I made earlier,
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:25.380]   which is that nothing that I am about to say
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:28.100]   relates directly to issues of legality.
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:30.460]   If we consider alcohol, for instance,
[02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:32.900]   alcohol is legal in most areas of the world,
[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:34.780]   it's certainly legal in the US,
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:37.940]   and yet there's an age limit for its use.
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:39.900]   Typically, it's not available to people
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.660]   until they're 21 or older.
[02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:43.220]   It's not to say that certain people don't use it
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:46.980]   before age 21, but it's not legal.
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:50.100]   It is illegal to buy or possess alcohol,
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.180]   consume alcohol before age 21.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:53.420]   And I think with good reason,
[02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:55.980]   because the brain is still developing.
[02:18:55.980 --> 02:19:00.980]   Likewise, we can have a informed discussion about cannabis
[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:05.300]   and its various components that can fully acknowledge
[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:10.300]   the reality, which is that one of the major harms of cannabis
[02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:13.780]   in the past has been the legal ramifications
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:15.260]   of cannabis being illegal.
[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:18.980]   That's a statement that is no longer controversial.
[02:19:18.980 --> 02:19:21.000]   And this is not a discussion about legalization
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.260]   or non-legalization.
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:24.240]   If you look to the scientific literature,
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.720]   the epidemiological literature,
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.320]   there are wonderful data out of Carleton University
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:30.960]   and elsewhere in Canada,
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:35.960]   showing that many of the negative effects of marijuana
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:41.100]   and THC are due to the criminal justice system itself.
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:45.600]   That is the creation of illicit drug businesses,
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:47.780]   the creation of organized crime,
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:50.200]   the creation of a number of different features
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:54.220]   related to the illegality of cannabis.
[02:19:54.220 --> 02:19:57.280]   And again, this isn't the topic of today's episode,
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:59.240]   but that should be acknowledged.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.340]   And at the same time, we need to acknowledge
[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:04.540]   that when a compound, a drug
[02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:07.580]   or whatever you want to call it becomes legal,
[02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:09.620]   there's a tendency to assume that it's safe
[02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:11.220]   and safe for everybody.
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:15.820]   And with respect to cannabis and THC and perhaps even CBD,
[02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:20.800]   but certainly for THC and cannabis that's smoked or vaped
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:24.740]   or consumed in edible form, that is simply not the case.
[02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:28.420]   There are clear data pointing to negative health effects
[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:30.440]   of cannabis use and THC use,
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.480]   which again is not to say that there are not
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:36.000]   positive effects on mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.520]   Those are out there and they exist.
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.200]   And we will mention some of those, of course.
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.780]   And we've talked about some of those,
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:42.900]   creativity, for instance, et cetera.
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:46.280]   But if we do not acknowledge the negative health effects
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:48.300]   that are documented in the literature,
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:51.540]   then we are overlooking some very important data,
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:54.960]   especially as it relates to the development of psychosis
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.940]   in certain individuals.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:01.180]   So with that said, there are very strong data,
[02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:03.260]   and I will provide links to these resources,
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:04.820]   pointing to the fact that for people
[02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:07.180]   who are chronic users of cannabis,
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:09.720]   that is using it twice a week or more,
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:13.540]   that over time their levels of anxiety actually increase.
[02:21:13.540 --> 02:21:15.580]   And this is true even for individuals
[02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:17.180]   that are using strains of cannabis
[02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:21.460]   that while under the influence of cannabis reduce anxiety.
[02:21:21.460 --> 02:21:26.460]   Over time, meaning over the course of 12 or more months,
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:31.500]   there is a well-documented effect of the anxiety relief
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:35.220]   that cannabis and THC initially brought
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:36.860]   being less and less potent.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:41.340]   That is people need to smoke more of it or ingest more THC
[02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:44.420]   in order to achieve the same level of anxiety relief.
[02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:47.980]   And in some cases, a switch from anxiety relief
[02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:50.080]   to increase in anxiety.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:52.420]   And again, that's increase in anxiety,
[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:55.860]   not just when the drug is not being consumed,
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:58.580]   but also while under the influence of the drug.
[02:21:58.580 --> 02:21:59.900]   Why would that be?
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:01.740]   We have to go back to our understanding
[02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:04.980]   of the CB1 receptor and the potency
[02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:08.200]   with which THC binds to that CB1 receptor.
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:12.660]   When THC is brought into the system over and over again,
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:16.000]   meaning twice a week or more,
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.320]   the binding of THC to that CB1 receptor
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:23.480]   eventually causes a sort of habituation or attenuation
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:26.740]   of the entire process of binding the receptor
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:28.680]   and creating the psychoactive effects.
[02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:30.720]   So initially it creates anxiety relief,
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:35.080]   but over time, the affinity for the receptor doesn't change,
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.600]   meaning it can still park in that slot
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:39.360]   with a lot of affinity, a lot of strength,
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.120]   but there are fewer receptors available.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:46.540]   And then the signaling that's downstream of those receptors
[02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:48.720]   becomes less and less robust.
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.800]   Now, this is a topic we didn't get into
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:52.380]   in too much detail today
[02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.540]   because I didn't want to include
[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:55.220]   even more biological detail,
[02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:57.980]   but the CB1 receptor is a so-called
[02:22:57.980 --> 02:23:00.180]   G protein-coupled receptor.
[02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:02.660]   That's a mouthful, but a G protein-coupled receptor
[02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:04.800]   basically is like a bucket brigade.
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:06.620]   So while some receptors in the brain and body
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:09.940]   are such that when something, a chemical binds to them,
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:11.660]   that receptor has a direct action,
[02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:14.060]   like it opens and allows stuff to rush into the cell,
[02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:16.280]   increases the excitability of the cell,
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:18.000]   so-called fast effects.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.360]   These G protein-coupled receptors,
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:23.560]   and CB1 is a G protein-coupled receptor,
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:25.020]   they are more like a bucket brigade
[02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:28.320]   where they kick off a process through one molecule
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:30.720]   that then is handed off to another molecule
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:32.820]   that this then is handed off to another molecule.
[02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:36.160]   It's a long chain or cascade of events.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:38.660]   Those long chains or cascades of events
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:42.400]   have a lot of opportunity for regulation, for adjustment.
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:44.080]   Receptor systems in the brain and body,
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.400]   especially receptor systems like the cannabinoid system
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:49.600]   that are used to being kind of tickled, not punched,
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:52.080]   tickled by endogenous cannabinoids every once in a while,
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.940]   some binds, has an effect,
[02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:58.080]   but certainly not bound with incredible potency
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:23:59.080]   and over and over again,
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:01.540]   as they are when THC is coming into the system.
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:03.140]   Well, those systems eventually over time,
[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:07.040]   they adjust themselves so that the body and those cells
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:09.360]   can achieve so-called homeostasis.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:13.740]   So when people are using THC more than twice a week,
[02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:16.240]   what ends up happening is those G protein-coupled receptors
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:17.960]   and the downstream signaling mechanisms
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:19.480]   start to adjust themselves
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:23.280]   and it requires more and more drug,
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:26.020]   so either higher dosages or more frequent use.
[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:29.380]   And a lot of the positive effects,
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:30.880]   the so-called decrease in anxiety,
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:32.660]   increased focus, increased creativity,
[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:34.120]   some of that starts to wane.
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:35.160]   It starts to dissipate
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.820]   and people wonder why they have to use so much cannabis
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:40.440]   just to achieve a fraction of the effect
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:44.520]   that they used to be able to achieve with even a lower dose.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:46.660]   So anxiety is getting worse over time
[02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:49.240]   and that's anxiety during the drug use
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.140]   and outside of the drug use.
[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:54.940]   Some people work around that or try to work around that
[02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:57.920]   by using varying strains of cannabis
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:01.620]   or changing the pattern of delivery from smoking to vaping
[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:04.720]   or from vaping to edible and from edible to transdermal.
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:06.720]   Anyway, they go through a lot of gymnastics
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:09.860]   and writhing and seeking,
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:12.820]   but nonetheless, anxiety increases over time.
[02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:17.440]   Also, it's very clear that depression increases over time
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:19.600]   and especially, this is surprising to me,
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.740]   but especially for individuals that were not depressed
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.260]   at the outset of their use.
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:25.840]   In other words, they didn't start using cannabis
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:27.480]   because they were depressed,
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:30.660]   but rather the depression starts to emerge
[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:34.300]   as a consequence of the cannabis and THC use.
[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.220]   So that's serious.
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:37.760]   In fact, we now know,
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:40.200]   based on really solid epidemiological evidence,
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:43.020]   that depression is not a strong predictor
[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:45.440]   of seeking out cannabis.
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:48.080]   It doesn't drive terribly many people
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.000]   to seek out cannabis use,
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.440]   but cannabis use itself makes people four times likelier
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:57.600]   to develop a chronic major depression.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:01.600]   So anxiety is increasing, depression is increasing,
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:05.000]   and this turns out to be especially relevant
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.800]   and important to young people.
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:07.720]   Why do I say that?
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.360]   Well, if you look at the data,
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.480]   and again, I think some of the strongest data
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:13.880]   or data to come out of the Canadian system,
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:15.920]   they've done some really beautiful controlled studies.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:18.380]   I really hope to invite some of the people
[02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:20.660]   who arranged and ran those studies
[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:22.820]   as guests onto the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:25.560]   But if you look at the data out of Canada
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:26.600]   or you look at some of the data
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:28.360]   out of Northern Europe and the US,
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.120]   what you find is that the probability
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:33.280]   that somebody will use cannabis
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:35.960]   and then go on to use it chronically
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:37.720]   correlates very strongly with age.
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:40.820]   So for instance, some of the highest degree of cannabis use
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:44.820]   is among individuals 16 to 24 years old.
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:48.380]   In fact, in individuals who are 16 to 24 years old,
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:50.720]   and in particular in students
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:53.260]   and people who are working, surprising,
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:56.180]   more than in unemployed populations,
[02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:59.580]   being young, 16 to 24, at least to me that's young,
[02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:03.660]   and being a student or working doubles the likelihood
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:06.400]   that somebody is going to use cannabis on a regular basis,
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.580]   twice or more per week.
[02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:11.120]   The typical age of initiating cannabis use nowadays
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:14.760]   is about 19 years old, so 18.7.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:18.400]   And about 20% of people in that age bracket
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.000]   of 16 to 24 years old are using cannabis daily,
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.860]   either by vaping, by smoking, or by edible.
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:26.160]   That's an enormous number.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:28.360]   At least by my read, it's an enormous number.
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.660]   And here's why it's of really serious concern.
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:35.860]   During the ages of 16 to 24,
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:38.780]   the cannabinoid receptors are still available.
[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:40.760]   They are not being as strongly driven
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:42.620]   by endogenous cannabinoids.
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:47.620]   But by ingestion of THC and/or CBD,
[02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:50.040]   there are downstream effects on the signaling
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:53.520]   within those cells that all the data point
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.340]   to creating a much, much higher likelihood
[02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:02.160]   of developing major depression, severe anxiety,
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:04.640]   or psychosis at later ages.
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:05.860]   So to be very clear,
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:09.420]   cannabis use between the ages of 16 to 24
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:13.200]   in both males and females is increasing anxiety,
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:15.580]   increasing depression in the immediate years
[02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:17.440]   and within the one year's time or so,
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:21.140]   so much so that people are using cannabis ongoing
[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:24.080]   in an attempt to reduce that anxiety
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:25.580]   and reduce that depression.
[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:28.140]   But in addition to that, the cannabis use,
[02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:31.340]   and because of the signaling mechanisms involved,
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:35.600]   are predisposing those individuals to psychosis later in life.
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:38.920]   If you look at individuals who start using cannabis
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:43.660]   even younger, age 14, or even as young as 12,
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:46.040]   the probability of psychosis later in life,
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:49.680]   in particular schizophrenic or schizophrenic-like episodes,
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.380]   more than doubles.
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:54.220]   So this is of really serious concern.
[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:56.480]   And this is completely aside
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:58.660]   from any so-called positive effects
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:01.300]   or beneficial effects of cannabis
[02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:03.980]   that people might derive from occasional use as adults,
[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:06.000]   meaning people older than 25.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.700]   So for the person who's older than 25
[02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:09.980]   who eats an edible every once in a while
[02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:12.300]   or who smokes cannabis every once in a while,
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:14.060]   and people love to make the argument,
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:15.780]   it's not as bad as alcohol,
[02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:17.500]   which frankly is a terrible argument
[02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:19.100]   because if you saw our episode on alcohol,
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:20.860]   alcohol is pretty bad.
[02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:23.740]   But even so, it's just not a good argument.
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:25.140]   Saying that something is good
[02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:27.020]   because it's not as bad as something else
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:29.300]   is simply just not a good or valid argument,
[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:31.000]   at least not biologically speaking.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.220]   The use of cannabis in young populations
[02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:38.660]   is very strongly predisposing people to psychotic episodes.
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:42.700]   And we know the mechanism by which this occurs.
[02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:46.860]   This occurs by a thinning of the so-called gray matter.
[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:48.340]   And it's called gray matter
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:51.220]   because with neurons, nerve cells,
[02:29:51.220 --> 02:29:52.700]   they have a so-called cell body.
[02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:54.660]   That's the part that contains the DNA
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:57.100]   and manufactures all the neurotransmitters, et cetera.
[02:29:57.100 --> 02:30:00.080]   And those are shipped out to the other parts of the neuron
[02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:02.460]   that include the axon, the wires between axons.
[02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:05.100]   And those axons under the microscope,
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:06.980]   because they have a lot of fatty tissue around them,
[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:08.260]   and this is healthy fatty tissue
[02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:10.340]   that allows electrical transmission to be fast,
[02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:12.820]   that fatty tissue, those portions of the cells
[02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:13.920]   are called white matter.
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:15.580]   So you have gray matter and white matter.
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.340]   Gray matter are the so-called cell bodies
[02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:19.680]   where the DNA and all this stuff is manufactured.
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:23.660]   White matter are the axons or the wires
[02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:26.300]   through which all the key components are shipped out
[02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:27.740]   to the synapse, et cetera.
[02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:30.180]   Wonderful data.
[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:31.360]   And I do say wonderful
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:33.780]   because this is part of a large-scale consortium,
[02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:35.060]   and we will provide a link to the paper.
[02:30:35.060 --> 02:30:37.700]   This was published in Translational Psychiatry
[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:38.880]   just this year.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:43.480]   Point to the fact that adolescent cannabis use
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:46.580]   accelerates the thinning of the prefrontal cortex
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:47.900]   and the gray matter in particular.
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:51.580]   So what this means is while during normal development,
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:53.860]   the gray matter, the prefrontal cortex,
[02:30:53.860 --> 02:30:56.240]   and all the cells there are indeed intended,
[02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:58.420]   it's a normal process for it to thicken
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:02.540]   and then thin a little bit as connections are adjusted
[02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:04.620]   and people learn and mature and grow up.
[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:07.180]   This is part of the normal healthy maturational process
[02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:09.820]   independent of cannabis use.
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:13.820]   When kids, 'cause these really are kids, use cannabis
[02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:15.860]   and it doesn't matter the mode of cannabis delivery,
[02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:18.360]   whether or not it's vaping or smoking or edible,
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:21.560]   that gray matter thins at a much, much greater rate.
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:22.860]   And the reason I like this paper
[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:26.380]   published in Translational Psychiatry this year so much
[02:31:26.380 --> 02:31:29.520]   is that they link the amount of cannabis use,
[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:32.760]   heavy, moderate, light, or no cannabis use
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:35.480]   to the rate of prefrontal cortical thinning.
[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:38.500]   And it's absolutely clear from these data
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:41.520]   that the more often young people,
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:44.720]   meaning individuals between the age of 14 and 25,
[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:48.800]   the more often they consume or smoke or vape cannabis,
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:52.220]   the faster and the more extreme that cortical thinning is.
[02:31:52.220 --> 02:31:53.620]   And the cortical thinning is occurring
[02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:55.060]   in exactly the area of the brain
[02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:56.740]   that's involved in planning,
[02:31:56.740 --> 02:32:00.560]   in control over one's emotions, in reflexes,
[02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:03.980]   in organizing one's life in a number of different ways,
[02:32:03.980 --> 02:32:06.660]   anywhere from cleaning one's room, literally,
[02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:08.100]   you know, knowing what goes where,
[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:10.700]   to making plans that extend out through the day,
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:12.140]   through the week, through a year,
[02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:14.060]   essentially becoming a functional human being
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:15.980]   involves using your prefrontal cortex
[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:17.520]   in a variety of different contexts
[02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:19.320]   and different sort of time domains,
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:21.820]   the time domain of an hour, the time domain of a day.
[02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:25.000]   Making plans and being able to execute plans
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.940]   is fundamental to being a healthy human being.
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:29.080]   And it's absolutely clear from these data
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:32.780]   that the more cannabis one uses,
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:35.360]   the more impaired those neural circuits are.
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:38.800]   There's simply no other way to view these data.
[02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:42.420]   In fact, so much so that even small amounts of cannabis use
[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:44.580]   are associated with rates of cortical thinning
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:45.980]   and degrees of cortical thinning
[02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:48.340]   that are really detrimental and concerning
[02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:51.220]   for normal cognitive processes.
[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:54.180]   If you were somebody who smoked marijuana
[02:32:54.180 --> 02:32:57.140]   or consumed cannabis in any form or another
[02:32:57.140 --> 02:32:59.100]   during adolescence,
[02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:00.980]   does that mean that your prefrontal cortex
[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:03.780]   can never be rescued, that it can't come back?
[02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:05.260]   Well, the short answer is
[02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:07.380]   it probably can be rescued to some degree.
[02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:10.940]   It will depend on how much cannabis you were using
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:14.920]   and how often and what strains of cannabis, et cetera.
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:16.620]   There's really no traveling back in time.
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.460]   As my graduate advisor used to say,
[02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:20.020]   time machines are broken.
[02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:21.480]   At least for now, we don't have time machines.
[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:24.700]   So all you can really do is try and emphasize,
[02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:28.540]   first of all, quitting cannabis in any form
[02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:33.540]   and focusing on behaviors that emphasize endothelial cell,
[02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:35.700]   blood flow, health to the brain.
[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:38.740]   So that would be cardiovascular exercise,
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:41.500]   adequate nutrition, not smoking nicotine.
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:43.860]   And there are a number of other things that one can do.
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:45.020]   We will do an entire episode
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:48.940]   all about trying to reverse the effects of cannabis
[02:33:48.940 --> 02:33:50.840]   and other drug use during adolescence.
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.940]   We don't have time to do a deep dive on that right now.
[02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:54.580]   But all the things that standardize
[02:33:54.580 --> 02:33:58.040]   and kind of promote health, adequate sleep,
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:01.540]   good social connection, regular cardiovascular
[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:04.660]   and weight training exercise, healthy nutrition,
[02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:05.820]   what that represents to you,
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:08.060]   healthy metabolic function and weight, et cetera,
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:09.620]   those are all going to facilitate
[02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:12.300]   some recovery of brain function
[02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:14.660]   in particular prefrontal cortical function
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:16.100]   by way of all the positive effects
[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:19.160]   that those behaviors and choices have.
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:22.220]   But with that said, if you are in the age bracket
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:23.280]   that I've been referring to,
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:25.700]   this 14 to 25-year-old age bracket,
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:30.540]   and you are a occasional even or chronic cannabis user,
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:34.040]   you should be very, very careful and concerned
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:36.960]   about the long-term effects that could potentially have.
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:39.380]   That statement is bolstered by another statistic,
[02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:42.820]   which is that unlike a lot of other drugs,
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:47.600]   the rate of cannabis use is strongly related
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:52.500]   to how dangerous people perceive cannabis to be.
[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:54.740]   And that might seem obvious on the one hand.
[02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:57.260]   If you think something is very, very dangerous,
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:58.840]   you would expect that the probability
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:01.000]   that somebody would use it would be very, very low.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.080]   And if they think something is safe,
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:04.500]   the probability would be high.
[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:06.600]   But that isn't necessarily the case.
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:10.500]   If you think about it, cannabis is a unique instance
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:12.900]   in which nowadays we are hearing,
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:15.380]   yes, it's becoming legal in a number of areas,
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:17.600]   and we talked earlier about why that's probably a good thing
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:19.260]   in most circumstances,
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:22.340]   but that we aren't just hearing that cannabis is safe
[02:35:22.340 --> 02:35:25.960]   or it's not just being implied that cannabis is safer,
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:28.100]   but many more people are talking
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:30.820]   about the positive effects of cannabis
[02:35:30.820 --> 02:35:32.340]   without a lot of discussion
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:34.340]   about the negative effects of cannabis.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:36.600]   And I realize that saying this is going to upset
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:37.440]   some people out there,
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:38.760]   because I know that there are a number of people
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:41.080]   who fought very hard for the legalization process,
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:42.880]   and I want to acknowledge that.
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:47.720]   I also want to acknowledge the many known positive effects
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:52.520]   of cannabis in adults with very occasional use,
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:55.280]   provided it is delivered safely
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:59.520]   and in the safe context and setting and with legality.
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:02.020]   That is entirely distinct from the issue
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:04.840]   of whether or not cannabis is safe for the developing brain
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:05.680]   and body.
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.060]   Again, I'm not demonizing anybody for using cannabis,
[02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:12.760]   but I want to make the point very simply and very directly.
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:17.200]   It is far and away a different circumstance for the brain
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:21.920]   for an individual to be 25 years or older
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:25.960]   and using cannabis in whatever form occasionally,
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.720]   or maybe even frequently,
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:32.720]   than it is for a young person aged 14 to 25
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:36.620]   to be using cannabis, either by smoking or vaping
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:41.240]   or by edible or any other form on the brain and body.
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:44.260]   It's absolutely clear that the brain continues to develop
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:47.980]   at least until age 25 and that a huge number of systems
[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:51.300]   related to mood regulation, so-called executive function,
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:53.040]   the ability to organize one's thoughts,
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.500]   plan and execute plans,
[02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:58.060]   essentially to become a functional human being.
[02:36:58.060 --> 02:37:00.500]   That's one portion of becoming a functional human being,
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:02.620]   but certainly an essential one.
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:05.000]   All of that relies on the fine tuning
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.980]   of this neural circuitry that we've been talking about
[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:09.660]   up until now.
[02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:14.660]   And it's abundantly clear that cannabis and THC in particular
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:19.340]   dramatically disrupt those processes.
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:23.940]   So if this isn't clear enough just from my statements,
[02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:26.000]   I'd like to point to a particular paper.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.620]   This is one of the more impactful papers
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:29.640]   in this area in recent years.
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.660]   This is a paper published in Lancet Psychiatry in 2022.
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:36.700]   Title is Association of Cannabis Potency
[02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:40.300]   with Mental Ill Health and Addiction, a Systematic Review.
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:41.940]   There are a number of very important points
[02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:43.780]   in this very fine paper.
[02:37:43.780 --> 02:37:46.980]   Lancet Psychiatry is one of the premier medical journals
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:51.420]   out there and they evaluated a huge number of studies.
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:54.420]   They actually looked at more than 4,000 studies.
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:57.540]   They selected the ones that were only the most rigorous
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:00.460]   in terms of study design and analysis
[02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:02.620]   and rigor of conclusions.
[02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:06.420]   And they looked at how early use of cannabis
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:10.860]   impacted later probability of development of psychosis
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:12.940]   and other psychiatric conditions.
[02:38:12.940 --> 02:38:16.580]   And the takeaways from this study are very clear.
[02:38:16.580 --> 02:38:19.820]   First of all, chronic cannabis use,
[02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:22.980]   so more than twice per week, has consistently been associated
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:24.320]   with mental health disorders.
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:26.940]   I'm pulling some phrases directly from the paper.
[02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:31.160]   Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis use more frequent
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:34.340]   than twice per week has been associated
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:37.180]   with four times the risk of psychosis later in life.
[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:40.700]   In particular, schizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.
[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:43.020]   Now we've done an episode on bipolar disorder,
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:44.660]   so-called bipolar depression.
[02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:46.220]   We have not yet done one on schizophrenia,
[02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:48.780]   but both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:51.860]   have a very, very strong genetic component.
[02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:55.340]   There's a 30, three zero, 30 times greater likelihood
[02:38:55.340 --> 02:38:56.560]   that you'll have bipolar disorder
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.420]   if you have a first relative who has bipolar disorder.
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:03.000]   And then it's also the case that using cannabis,
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.760]   especially during adolescence and the teen years
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:09.300]   and up until age 25, create a four times greater risk
[02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:12.540]   of psychosis for those that have a predisposition
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:15.860]   to bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia.
[02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:18.680]   Now I don't hear very much about this in the media.
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:20.060]   This paper got some attention
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:22.780]   and then it sort of got swept away.
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:24.460]   I don't think that was an intentional sweeping way.
[02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:27.780]   There's just a lot of events in the world, as you well know.
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:31.160]   But I think it's a particularly important set of findings
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.940]   because obviously in looking at so many studies,
[02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:37.300]   it distills out the strongest findings that are out there
[02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:40.580]   and really pulls the consistent messages
[02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:42.700]   that are arriving from all these different studies.
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:45.980]   And as they point out, and again, I'm paraphrasing here,
[02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:47.580]   this is the first systematic review
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:50.820]   of the Association of Cannabis Potency.
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:53.300]   And all of the data point to a very clear conclusion,
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:58.300]   which is the more potent the THC concentration,
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:00.660]   the higher probability of developing psychosis
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:02.180]   or a major depressive episode
[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:04.620]   or a major anxiety disorder later in life.
[02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:06.960]   That should be of particular concern
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:11.280]   because we know, we are absolutely clear about the fact
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:14.860]   that with the advent of all these new strains of cannabis
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:19.520]   and with the engineering and availability of cannabis
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:24.060]   at much higher potency, meaning THC potency,
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:26.960]   the risk of psychosis is going up and up
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:28.500]   and is likely to continue going up
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:31.100]   unless something is done to reduce
[02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:36.100]   the frequency of cannabis use to zero, ideally,
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:39.180]   or to very low frequency, very low potency
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:43.620]   in adolescents and teens and people aged 25 or younger.
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:45.880]   I know a lot of people don't want to hear this message
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:47.200]   because first of all, it's alarming.
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.800]   And second of all, as I mentioned earlier,
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:53.140]   the statistics tell us that the greatest number of people
[02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:54.500]   that are starting to use cannabis
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:57.240]   are in the age bracket of 16 to 24.
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:00.360]   Many of them are functional in other areas of life.
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:03.740]   They are students, they are employed, et cetera.
[02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:05.820]   But when you couple that with the fact
[02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:08.560]   that the most frequent adopters of cannabis use
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:11.280]   are in this age bracket of 16 to 24,
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.640]   they're twice as likely to use as other individuals
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:17.480]   or to start using cannabis as our other individuals,
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:19.520]   plus the general perception out there
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:22.600]   because of the way that cannabis is discussed in the media
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:24.760]   and by sports figures and by celebrities
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:27.240]   and by politicians, et cetera,
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:30.920]   that it's not as bad as alcohol and maybe not that bad
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:33.580]   and maybe even has health benefits,
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:35.000]   then you're essentially setting up a system
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.040]   where young people are far more likely
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:39.680]   to adopt and continue cannabis use
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:42.660]   without realizing these serious health consequences
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:43.760]   that await them later.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:48.120]   With all of that said, I of course, again,
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.480]   want to acknowledge that there have been
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:56.480]   well-demonstrated effects of cannabis for reducing pain,
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:58.920]   in particular in chemotherapy
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:02.240]   and in the context of reducing nausea
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:04.800]   in people suffering from cancer or chemotherapy.
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:07.460]   There is a well-known effect
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:09.960]   that one can generally point to as positive
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.400]   using cannabis for things like glaucoma,
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.680]   for lowering intraocular pressure
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:17.200]   and offsetting the loss of neurons
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:18.220]   that would lead to blindness,
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:19.640]   although there are other tools, of course,
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:21.240]   that don't involve cannabis use
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:23.560]   that can accomplish that as well,
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:28.440]   so-called intraocular pressure lowering drugs or drops.
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.280]   There is a list of probably a dozen or more
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:35.900]   psychological and bodily ailments
[02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:37.760]   that can be aided by cannabis use,
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.200]   in particular edible cannabis use of particular strains.
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:45.760]   Of course, I'm going to address each and every one of those
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:48.200]   in episodes where I'm talking, for instance,
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:51.040]   about eye disease or about chronic pain.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.200]   I am in no way, shape, or form trying to rob
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:56.540]   the incredible efforts of the laboratories
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:58.660]   and people that have worked very hard
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:02.680]   to study and establish the valid uses of cannabis
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:04.320]   for treating various ailments
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:06.260]   and that continue to study cannabis
[02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:08.860]   in order to try and ameliorate the symptoms
[02:43:08.860 --> 02:43:10.000]   of different ailments.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.780]   But today I really wanted to emphasize
[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:14.960]   the biology of cannabis.
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:18.160]   Some of the often discussed effects,
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:19.660]   I guess one could call them positive effects,
[02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:20.940]   things like enhanced creativity,
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:23.960]   and really point to the nuance and actually the divergence
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:27.440]   of people who take cannabis and some experience
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:29.520]   heightened levels of creativity and some do not.
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.500]   Some people experience heightened levels of sexual arousal
[02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:36.360]   and some people experience the exact opposite
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:37.840]   and so on and so forth,
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:40.640]   rather than focus on all the potential positive
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:44.040]   and sort of emerging positive data about cannabis
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:45.740]   in different medical contexts.
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:48.480]   And at the same time, I strongly feel that it's important
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:51.800]   to acknowledge the shocking,
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:54.300]   because there's really no other way to describe it,
[02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:57.760]   the shocking effects of cannabis use
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:01.040]   on the developing fetus and the fact that so many pregnant
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:03.220]   and lactating mothers are using cannabis.
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:06.440]   I mean, that number 15% still has me dizzy
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:08.800]   with kind of disbelief and yet we need to acknowledge this
[02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:11.360]   and address this immediately.
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:15.300]   And I think it's vital to understand that cannabis use
[02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:18.960]   through any delivery mechanism,
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:22.120]   smoking or vaping or edible or otherwise,
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:24.680]   is very, very concerning.
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:26.840]   In fact, dangerous to the developing brain,
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:29.580]   certainly for the fetal brain and for the baby brain,
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:32.600]   but also for the adolescent brain
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:35.580]   and for the teen and young adult brain,
[02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:37.440]   not just because of the effects that it can have
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:38.280]   in the immediate term,
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:41.420]   those slow creeping increases in anxiety and depression
[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:43.740]   brought on by cannabis use,
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:47.900]   but also the time release, if you will,
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:49.900]   on the development of psychosis
[02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:54.240]   and other types of major psychiatric disorders later in life.
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:56.440]   I acknowledge we've covered a lot of ground today
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:58.180]   and yet there's still far more ground
[02:44:58.180 --> 02:44:59.120]   that we could have covered
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:02.800]   and that we will indeed cover in future episodes.
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:05.400]   Nevertheless, if you are learning from
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:06.920]   and are enjoying this podcast,

[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:33.420]   As mentioned earlier,
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:35.840]   the Huberman Lab podcast now has a premium channel.
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:37.000]   You can subscribe to that

[02:45:53.140 --> 02:45:56.120]   Again, that's Hubermanlab.com/premium.
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:58.280]   Not so much today, but in many previous episodes
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:00.700]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.
[02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:02.900]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:04.920]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:06.880]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:08.560]   and hormone optimization.
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:09.600]   The Huberman Lab podcast
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:11.200]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.040]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.360]   that the Huberman Lab podcast
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:14.840]   has partnered with Momentous on,
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:17.240]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:19.720]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:21.660]   And there you'll see a number of the supplements
[02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:23.640]   that we talk about regularly on the podcast.
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:25.560]   I should just mention that that catalog of supplements
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:27.040]   is constantly being updated.
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:28.080]   If you haven't already signed up for
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:29.160]   the Neural Network newsletter,
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:31.940]   this is a monthly Huberman Lab podcast newsletter
[02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:35.000]   in which you get some brief show notes summaries
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.920]   as well as a lot of actionable tools in summary form.
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:39.600]   Many people find these very useful
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:42.120]   for distilling out the vast amount of information
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:43.520]   that we cover on the podcast.
[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:45.860]   So for instance, if you go to Hubermanlab.com,
[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:47.620]   you can click on the menu,
[02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:51.020]   click to Neural Network newsletter or simply newsletter,
[02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:52.960]   and you can sign up, just give us your email.
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:54.860]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:57.160]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:46:59.320]   We also have examples of previous newsletters
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:00.460]   that you can download immediately
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:01.820]   without having to sign up for anything
[02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:03.480]   and decide whether or not you want to sign up.
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:05.060]   Again, that's the Neural Network newsletter
[02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:06.820]   at Hubermanlab.com.
[02:47:06.820 --> 02:47:08.900]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:11.340]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, on Twitter,
[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:13.100]   on Facebook, and on LinkedIn.
[02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:16.020]   And especially on Instagram and on Twitter,
[02:47:16.020 --> 02:47:18.300]   I cover many of the tools that are discussed
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:19.340]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:47:19.340 --> 02:47:21.160]   but also a lot of science and science-based tools
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:23.340]   not covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:47:23.340 --> 02:47:25.620]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:27.100]   So once again, thank you for joining me
[02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:29.880]   for today's discussion all about cannabis.
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:33.020]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:35.600]   [upbeat music]
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:38.180]   (upbeat music)
