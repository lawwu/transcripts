[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   A common issue for those trying to cultivate a deeper life in our current world of constant
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.920]   distraction is that of procrastination.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.400]   You have a big idea, something that can make a major change to your working life or your
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.040]   life outside of work.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.440]   Maybe it's a side hustle that could become something bigger.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.080]   Maybe it's a new serious commitment to fitness.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.200]   Maybe it's a major change of location where you actually live or a hard skill that if
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   mastered would give you a lot of leverage in your job.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.840]   You're inspired, you're excited, but you're having a hard time getting going.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.500]   You find yourself putting it off or having a lot of false starts and it fizzles.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.760]   I want to talk about procrastination today because it's important, especially for those
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.480]   interested in the deep life.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160]   In particular, I want to talk about a new way of thinking about procrastination that
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.780]   I think makes it potentially easier to figure out what it is holding you back and will offer
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.720]   some new ideas about how to fix things.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.380]   So to start with, here is a realization I had recently in my own thoughts about procrastination.
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.600]   It's not a singular phenomenon.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.360]   There are different types of procrastination, which have different causes and different
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360]   solutions.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.900]   So if you mix up the solutions for the wrong type of procrastination, it might not actually
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.280]   help the issue that you're facing right now.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.640]   I want to focus in particular on two major types of procrastination.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.960]   We'll go through the first one, I think is what we more commonly think about with procrastination.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.620]   And then the second one is going to be this new one that I realized more recently is a
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.740]   big deal and it's going to have unique solutions.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.500]   So let's start with the more common type of procrastination.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.200]   For our purposes, let's call this tactical procrastination.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   This is where most of the advice you hear about procrastination is actually aimed.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.020]   Tactical procrastination is the result of not sufficiently having your act together.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.780]   If you do not sufficiently have your act together, it can be difficult to get going or make progress
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.780]   on a hard project.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.340]   Now let's be a little bit more specific here.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.480]   What are the specific causes?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.980]   What are the specific types of not having your act together that can cause tactical
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.980]   procrastination?
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.420]   One, potentially your brain does not trust your plan.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.580]   You haven't really thought this through.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.580]   Your brain says you don't know what you're doing.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.640]   And as we've talked about multiple times on the show before, if your brain doesn't trust
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.700]   your plan, it's not going to give you motivation to take action.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.300]   Another cause of practical procrastination could be that your brain is so bathed in distraction
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.100]   that you can no longer summon the ability to overcome even the most modest chemical
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.900]   obstacles to activity.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.980]   Now, if you're wondering what I mean when I say chemical obstacles to activity, you
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.020]   should listen to last week's episode on discipline.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.420]   But if you are constantly looking at this phone, you're constantly looking at your computer,
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.380]   you're so used to just bathing yourselves in dopamine, your mind is like, "What are
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.140]   you talking about?"
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.560]   Just any optional effort you show me is going to be much less exciting than just looking
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.780]   at distraction.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.220]   The final source of tactical procrastination is just you're too disorganized.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.220]   You're in reactive mode.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.740]   You have too much stuff going on.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.600]   You don't have control of your obligations.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.620]   You don't have control of your time.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.140]   And because of this, you just can't find the time to make regular progress on the particular
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.140]   problem.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.900]   All right.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.980]   Tactical procrastination has obvious solutions.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.620]   They're not easy to implement, but you have obvious solutions.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.140]   If your brain doesn't trust your plan, learn more about it.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.220]   You need to learn more about what it is you're trying to do.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.460]   And in doing so, you have to face the hard truths about how the particular world in which
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.460]   you're trying to act.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.580]   You have to face the hard truth about how it actually works.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.500]   The example I give so often on the show is people who want to rewrite how the publishing
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.000]   industry works instead of actually learning how you actually publish a book.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.460]   They want their plan they came up with to somehow give an end run around how the industry
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.820]   actually works.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.900]   Don't do an end round around how things actually work.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.900]   Figure out how it works.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   OK.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.020]   If you're too distracted to make progress, you need to break your dopamine addiction.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.780]   We talk about this all the time on the show.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.800]   Go back a couple episodes and you'll hear more about that.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.700]   You probably have to stop using social media.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.460]   It is not necessary.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.740]   You're not an influencer that people really care about.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.620]   It is not the core at what's making your business run.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.700]   It is you clocking into the invisible factory so that Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or Byte
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.820]   Dance can add another zero to their net worth.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.620]   You have to simplify your phone.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.540]   You have to rewire your phone, which means you plug it in when you're at home.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.760]   You don't keep it with you.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.400]   You have to practice spending time alone.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.500]   We talk about this stuff on the show.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.660]   That will solve that problem.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.300]   Finally, if you're just too disorganized to find the time to get going, you've got to
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.340]   get organized.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.020]   Go back and listen to my episode called "Productivity Basics" from a few weeks ago.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.020]   You need to do full capture.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.020]   You need to do multiscale planning.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.660]   You need to have autopilot scheduling.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.260]   You just need to be on the ball with what's going on in your life and your time.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.140]   These are solvable problems.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.700]   Tactical procrastination has solvable problems.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.100]   There's another type of procrastination that I think we talk about less often.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.020]   This was sort of my recent insight.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.700]   I call this strategic procrastination.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:45.380]   I'm calling it strategic procrastination because we are at another level of scale here.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.220]   Let's say you're in control.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.220]   You're organized.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.860]   You understand the field in which you're trying to act.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.940]   You're not addicted to your phone.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.580]   The issues of tactical procrastination just aren't there, and yet you're still reluctant
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.700]   to make progress.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.180]   The solution when it comes to strategic procrastination is a little bit unexpected.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.180]   Consider giving up.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.100]   Now, let me be a little bit more specific about this.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.060]   There's two things I could mean by this.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.020]   One, give up on the idea that you're procrastinating on, or two, give up on something else major
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.780]   so that you have room for the new project that you're going to execute.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.980]   This advice is coming from an underlying truth, which I think we often try to avoid, especially
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.660]   those of us who actually go through the hard work of getting our act together.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.620]   Major initiatives to be executed sustainably require a lot of time.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.540]   They require a lot of time within your week to make progress, and they require a lot of
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.620]   weeks so that that progress can add up into something significant.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.300]   We can't avoid this reality.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.860]   If your schedule is reasonably full, you might not just be able to add the new thing.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.020]   You just might not have time for it.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.140]   In this case, you can either say, "You know what?
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.100]   This was an inspiring idea, but I have these other things I've been working on for a while,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.460]   and I want to keep working on them," or you say, "We got to change something to make room
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.460]   for this.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.140]   I'm not going to squeeze it in."
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.660]   Major initiatives are not very susceptible to being squeezed in.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.060]   They require time, they require flexibility.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.900]   We talked about this actually in last week's in-depth episode with Oliver Berkman.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.420]   I think Oliver's pretty good, or I would say really good actually, at emphasizing what
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.900]   he calls finitude, finititude.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900]   You're finite.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.900]   Your time is finite.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.580]   There's only so much you can do.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.500]   The earlier you embrace that, the better, and this is exactly an instantiation of that
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   principle.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.960]   There's only so many major projects you can do.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.140]   How do you know if you have enough time?
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.140]   Well, I say, "Look, if you have a major new thing you want to work on, add it to your
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.540]   weekly template."
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.700]   This is when each week when I work on this, this time is set aside, it's protected, and
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.540]   I've set aside more than enough time for this.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.740]   It has buffer in it, right?
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.220]   It's not like I have to fill every minute of these small little gaps.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.100]   I got good chunks of time set aside.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.140]   If you can do that, you can make progress on something.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.740]   If you're having a hard time fitting that into your weekly template, then you don't
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.740]   have time.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.860]   So you have to remove something else or you do have time or you have to move on.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.140]   So giving up is actually a key strategy when it comes to strategic procrastination.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.820]   Now, I have three advanced points to make about this idea.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.100]   One, in general, when in doubt, even if you're feeling inspired about a new initiative, when
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.260]   in doubt, it's usually better to polish or improve efforts on existing initiatives than
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.860]   to add a new one, especially when you're feeling antsy, maybe a little bored.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.080]   Maybe you've been hit with a rush of inspiration that you want to act on.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.860]   It's tempting to add something new.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.680]   And what I want to argue is, it's often better to say, "Let me go back to this thing I've
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   already been working on.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.860]   I've been becoming a better writer, I'm becoming a better coder, I've been trying to get in
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.020]   better shape.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.220]   Let me improve the thing that I already have regular time set aside for.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.760]   Let me get more out of that time than trying to fit something else in."
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:22.820]   My second point is, the quest to find time for a major initiative can actually be useful
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.740]   as a way of cleaning up some of the clutter in your schedule.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:32.700]   So you get committed to this new initiative, you're trying to find time for it to sidestep
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.260]   strategic procrastination, and you might find, "Oh, the issue is I have all these little
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.220]   small commitments I've made.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.140]   I'm working on this thing, which I don't really care about anymore, but it's eating up a lot
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.540]   of my day, and I have these calls, and I'm taking this online course kind of half-heartedly,
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.780]   and look at all these days that it's taken up this time I could have."
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.780]   And it's a good forcing function for you to realize, "Oh, if I canceled this and got rid
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.940]   of this and cleaned up some of these smaller things, I could fit in something else major."
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.820]   So this process of finding time can actually be useful.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.980]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.480]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.940]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.360]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.740]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.540]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540]   Check it out.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.940]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:35.180]   Third point, sometimes it's helpful to work on something seasonally.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:42.300]   All right, I am going to temporarily stop working on this thing and give three months
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.460]   to this new initiative.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.140]   That's how I'm going to clear up time to give it more than enough time, to give it some
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.780]   breathing room, to give it the attention it deserves, to see if it gets legs, to see if
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.220]   it unfolds, to see if it's something worth adding to my life.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:05.060]   So like you're podcasting, and you go on a summer hiatus to work on another side hustle
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.540]   project, like a newsletter, you're not sure if you want to do this or not, give yourself
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.380]   more than enough time to do it by putting something temporarily on hold.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.980]   And then if that new thing goes really well, then you can make some decisions.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.140]   Oh, I want to permanently add this, I'm going to have to take something else out, I'm going
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.940]   to have to change something about my schedule.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.540]   So temporarily clearing the decks can sometimes be a good approach as well.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.540]   All right?
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.100]   So when it comes to procrastination, again, just to summarize, we think a lot about tactical
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.500]   procrastination, which is like, get your act together, so you can make more progress.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.820]   But sometimes that procrastination is strategic.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.940]   And the real problem is, you don't have enough time.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.980]   It's not your systems, it's not your organization, it's not your willpower.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.780]   It's a reality that you're finite, and there's only so much you can do.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.380]   There you go, Jesse, strategic procrastination.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.380]   I deal with that a lot.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.780]   I was going to say, did you have a bout with it recently?
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.700]   I mean, I deal with this all the time, really, because I have my act together, and there's
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.060]   lots of tempting big projects for me.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.660]   But I don't really have time for anything new.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.220]   And I often do put things on hold.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:18.980]   It's like going on book leave, the work on a book, you put something else aside, or this
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:24.300]   podcast took a long time to get added to my schedule because I had to find a way to find
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.460]   a regular time for it.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.220]   And I didn't have it until a few years ago, and then I did.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.660]   So yeah, strategic procrastination, I didn't have a name for it, but it's a big part about
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.060]   how I think about accomplishments.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:40.100]   All right, anyways, we've got some good questions coming up on all sorts of topics.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.380]   We kind of have a grab bag today.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.900]   But first, let's hear from one of our sponsors.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:52.300]   I want to talk in particular about our friends at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.940]   And drink mixes are something that I use almost daily.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:05.120]   Because what you get with these things is the electrolyte mix you need, but in a powder
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.760]   that is zero sugar, no dodgy stuff.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.720]   So you don't feel bad about using it.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.100]   They even have a sparkling product now where you can get it mixed in to a can of sparkling
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.580]   water, so you can just grab that right out of the fridge.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.900]   Actually, our friends at Backyard Ventures, Jesse, just sent me a huge collection of Element.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.740]   Yeah, so I am stocked up.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.460]   I use Element in the morning if I feel particularly dehydrated.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.660]   I do it for sure after I work out, and I do it after a day in which I've been talking
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.660]   a lot.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.540]   If I'm teaching or podcasting or doing interviews, I get dehydrated, and Element is a way for
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.580]   me to get hydrated again without having-- I'm not drinking a bunch of sugar.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.820]   I'm not drinking a bunch of weird artificial ingredients.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.940]   It just gives me the electrolytes I need, and it tastes great.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:14:00.740]   Quick note, as it gets colder, you can also enjoy Element hot, so the rest of the flavors
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.060]   like chocolate, the chocolate medley flavors, including chocolate mint, chocolate chai,
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.780]   and chocolate raspberry can be mixed into a hot drink.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:13.060]   So when you come in after shoveling that snow, it's a more comforting way to get that Element
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.060]   advantage.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.960]   All right, I have good news.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.380]   You can receive a free Element sample pack with any order when you go to drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:31.100]   That's drinkelement, L-M-N-T, .com/deep to get a free Element sample pack with any orders.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.580]   You could try it totally risk-free.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.020]   If you don't like it, just give it away to a salty friend, and they will give you your
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.020]   money back.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.020]   No questions asked.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.420]   I also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:49.300]   When you think about businesses whose scales are rocketing, like Feastables by Mr. Beef
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:55.220]   or Thrive Cosmetic or Cotopaxi, you think about their product, it's innovative, their
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.540]   progressive brand, their marketing, et cetera, but often overlooked when thinking about the
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:07.140]   success of these new brands is the business behind the business that makes selling simple.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:13.140]   For millions of businesses, including those I just mentioned, that is Shopify.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.500]   Nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.420]   It's home of the number one checkout on the planet.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.620]   Their shop pay feature boosts conversions up to 50%.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.860]   Way less of your shopping carts are going to go abandoned when you use Shopify.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.580]   So whether you're growing into your business, if you're going to your business, your commerce
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.420]   platform better be ready to sell wherever your customers are scrolling or scrolling
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.180]   on the web, in your store, in their feed, and everywhere in between.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.900]   If you want to sell more, you need to sell on Shopify.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:49.620]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout as Cotopaxi and Thrive Cosmetics
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.060]   when you use Shopify.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.020]   You can sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep, but you need to type
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.700]   that in all lowercase.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.860]   Go to shopify.com/deep to upgrade your selling today, shopify.com/deep.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.740]   All right, Jesse, let's get to some questions.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.380]   Who do we got first?
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.780]   First question is from Mrs. Exhausted.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.260]   I've been a pre-K and first grade teacher for six years in an elementary public school.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:22.020]   I love the students and I have amazing coworkers, but my district has been horrible with annual
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.020]   changes.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.100]   Should I switch counties to teach fifth grade with only one subject?
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:32.020]   Well, I'm going to use this as an example to talk about two general keys to keep in
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.660]   mind when considering a job change.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.300]   The first key, and this comes from my book So Good They Can't Ignore You, is to be careful
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.420]   when making a change that you're not throwing out hard-won career capital.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.460]   So career capital is my term for rare and valuable skills.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.780]   It is your main leverage for controlling the day-to-day reality of your job.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.980]   It's your main leverage for making your job sustainable and fulfilling.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:05.140]   An often-made mistake is to chase the content of the job and leave your career capital behind,
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.260]   and it's a mistake because career capital makes much more difference than the content
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.940]   of your job.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:17.220]   So if you were leaving teaching to go work at ESPN because you love sports, that would
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.100]   be probably a mistake because you're getting rid of all the career capital you had built
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.500]   up for teaching just to go after a job whose title or content is more appealing to you,
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.400]   but you'll soon realize the main thing that matters is not what your job is, but what
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.180]   you can do with your career capital.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.040]   You don't have this problem in the scenario we're discussing.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.740]   You're moving from teaching to teaching, so that would take your career capital with you.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.620]   The second thing to keep in mind when thinking about changing your job is to make sure that
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.420]   if you're unhappy with something about your current employer, you're not making a move
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.860]   to sort of protest or express your anger at the current employer.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.180]   They don't care.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.700]   They won't notice.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.100]   Your new employer will have other things that annoy you.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.980]   The main reason to make a move from one place to another within the same industry is that
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.180]   the job-related lifestyle factors are better.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.740]   So if you're doing lifestyle-centric planning, you have a vision of a life well lived, the
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.500]   elements of what you want in your life.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.340]   You have this clear vision, including sort of like the feel and rhythms of your job.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:26.020]   If the new job is moving you notably closer towards this vision, that's a good reason
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.220]   to change.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.300]   If you're just annoyed with the way that your current job is handling some things, that's
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.520]   much less of a good reason to change, right?
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.380]   Because here's the thing.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.020]   Let's say, for example, you're annoyed with how your current district is handling annual
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.020]   changes.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.300]   You go to this other district to teach fifth grade.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.880]   They'll do something else that annoys you, and you certainly never want to make a change
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.660]   to try to make a point because, again, no one cares.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:57.260]   In your mind, you imagine when you change districts because you don't like the way
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.180]   they handle annual changes, that there's like some war room somewhere in the school administration
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.840]   building where they're like, oh, no.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.500]   We just had a teacher leave for the fifth grade.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.580]   Why did they do it?
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.940]   She didn't like the annual changes, and they're like, ah, she was right.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.020]   What have we done?
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.020]   What have we done?
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.420]   They're rending their clothes, and like, we knew it.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.720]   We knew this was bad.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.000]   She really showed us, and there's someone just hitting the table.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Why?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Why?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   No one notices.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.960]   So don't make a change to spite someone.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.020]   Don't make a change to make a point.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.960]   Don't make a change because you're annoyed because you will be annoyed in almost every
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.720]   job, especially if you have a job in the public sector like public school teaching.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.520]   Public sector bureaucracies are going to annoy you.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   Spoiler alert.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.200]   So if you're going to change, bring your career capital and make sure that you're changing
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.640]   because the lifestyle implications are positive.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.080]   Now, that could be the case for you right here.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.320]   It sounds like it might be, so that would be a good reason to change if you're clear
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.140]   that this new position would get you closer to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.760]   But those two points, I think, apply to any potential job change.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.760]   All right.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.640]   Who do we got next?
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.600]   Next question's from Kevin.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.720]   Coding can be used to automate a lot of tasks if you properly set up on the front end.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   Do you use coding to automate tasks, or are there tasks that you recommend trying to make
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.120]   time to automate with scripts?
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:24.960]   Here's the thing about automating personal shallow work, as opposed to what most of these
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.800]   tools were created for, which is like automating processes that an organization or a team does.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.080]   To me, it's a hobby.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.600]   If you're a coder, it could be fun.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.360]   If you like it, like, "This is cool.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.600]   I got Zapier to connect to this API over here, and it does this automatically," it could
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   be fun.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.740]   If you're into it, go for it.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.520]   It's not going to make your working life significantly better, and it's far from a necessity for
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.640]   people in general to do.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.800]   This is just an extension, I think, of the productivity prong movement, which arose in
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:07.400]   the early 2000s, which has always sold this promise that with the right technology and
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.040]   the right technological skills, work can become significantly easier.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.160]   If you just deploy the right tool in the right way, work will become significantly easier
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.520]   just from a subjective experience.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:25.560]   This was the big push, for example, in the early 2000s in the Merlin Man 43 Folders community.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:31.040]   People thought, "Look, if we take David Allen's getting-thing-done methodology and we connect
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.400]   this with Mac-based computer tools, we can basically have the computer take over most
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.160]   of the hard stuff of work, and we'll just be cranking widgets, and work will get easy."
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.340]   And it didn't, because work is hard, and you can't automate in the end having to actually
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:51.920]   do the thing, figure out what email to write, do the reading, producing the new code, producing
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.240]   the words that need to come into the strategy memo.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.040]   That's the hard stuff that's going to be hard.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.480]   The context switching is going to be hard.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   You can't automate that away.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.400]   Most of what you do automate is actually not big of a footprint.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   It's not the problem.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   The problem is not, "How do I get these proposed dates from this email and onto my calendar?"
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.540]   It doesn't take long.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.800]   You open up a calendar over here, and you put the dates in, right?
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.360]   The hard thing is I have to think about which of these dates works when I was just working
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.440]   on something else, and now my mind is context shifted over.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.520]   You can't automate your way out of work being hard.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.720]   That being said, there is nothing wrong with it.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.440]   I think it's cool.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.720]   If you're kind of like a geek or a programmer like me, yeah, have at it, but if you're not,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   don't worry about it.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.040]   This is not somehow necessary for making your work much better.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.800]   All right, who we got next?
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.160]   All right, next question is from Tanner.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.840]   "When reading for pleasure, I have no problem, but when it comes to reading with the goal
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.640]   of retaining information for a project, I struggle.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.480]   Specifically, I have several biographies, classic texts, and self-help books I just
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.640]   can't seem to get through, sometimes only reading 15 pages in an hour."
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.400]   Some of this is just practice, right?
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.960]   I think you're jumping ahead into books that you're not that interested in, and you're
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.180]   not that used to reading, and your mind is like, "What are we up to here?"
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.560]   That's not a big deal.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.280]   Here's what you do.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.760]   In these genres where you are struggling, put in the work to find books in those genres
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.520]   that you are super psyched about and love, all right?
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   Instead of, let's say you're not used to biography, don't jump straight into saying, "I'm going
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:40.600]   to read all four extant volumes of Robert Carroll's Lyndon B. Johnson biography," right?
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:47.440]   But find a shorter biography of someone who's really interesting to you and is really motivating.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.720]   Maybe what you read instead is something maybe even more memoir-like.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.680]   Let's read Rich Roll's Finding Ultra, something where it's getting into someone's life, and
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.560]   they're doing something inspirational or whatever it is, but find something you love in self-help.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   That's its own genre.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   Find a self-help book that's like, "Put it in my veins.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.840]   This is exactly what I'm interested in.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.640]   This exactly talks to what I care about."
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.840]   You're going to zip through that book really quick.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.480]   As you get used to those genres, then you can kind of wander a little bit farther from
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.720]   the things that you absolutely love, and you get more used to reading other types of things.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.100]   I think that's fine.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.080]   You can also experiment with audio.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.240]   Some people really like listening to biographies on audio.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.960]   Maybe you want to try that as well, and you'll get more used to it.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:41.400]   A related point here, part of your problem might be dopamine addiction.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.160]   The problem might be, in addition to you not being used to these type of books, is that
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.880]   your mind is used to looking at your phone.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.620]   Every hint of boredom, I get a quick hit of algorithmically optimized distraction.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.680]   If that's the case, you need to work on that as well, because your brain could basically
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.600]   be saying, "This is boring."
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.060]   If you're only getting through 15 pages in an hour, your brain keeps disengaging from
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.160]   what you're doing, probably because it's seeking dopamine, and probably you're feeding it.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.480]   Probably you're getting 25 checks of your phone in that hour where you're only reading
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480]   15 pages.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.720]   There might be a deeper problem here where you need to reduce the noise in your life,
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.200]   and that's probably going to mean stepping away from social media.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.140]   My apologies again to Musk, Zuckerberg, and ByteDance, but you probably have to step away
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.460]   from social media.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.480]   You probably have to what I call rewiring your phone, which is plug your phone in when
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.280]   you're at home and keep it in that one location.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.800]   It's not with you as a default.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.080]   When you're reading, your phone's not there.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.320]   If you need to look something up, you have to go where your phone is plugged in and look
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.900]   it up and then go back to where you're reading.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.480]   You've got to rewire your phone and spend more time alone, outside, walking, just with
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.020]   your own thoughts.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.700]   As you reduce a dopamine addiction, you'll also probably have an easier time keeping
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.880]   your mind focused on the abstract for longer periods of time.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.720]   The final thing, if you really want to try to train this here, if you really think it's
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.600]   an attention issue, do interval training.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   Don't sit down for an hour and have your mind start wandering, you only get through 15 pages.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.640]   Instead, say, "I'm going to sit down with this hard book for 10 minutes and I'm going
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.600]   to read the hell out of it for 10 minutes."
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.920]   As soon as my mind wanders, like, "No, back.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   Let's just do this.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.880]   Let's move and focus and concentrate.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   It's just for 10 minutes.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.760]   I can do that."
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.520]   After you get comfortable with that, which may take a few weeks, you make it 15, then
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   you make it 20.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.280]   You can also directly interval train the specific focus that is induced when you're reading
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   a book.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.480]   Again, your brain will get more used to this.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.160]   All of this, I'm just giving you all these different ideas to help prepare and train
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.800]   your brain for reading these books.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.600]   It's all casting reading books like you would cast shooting free throws or playing the guitar.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.180]   It's not at all surprising, it means very little to me that you say, "Look, I just started
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.000]   trying to shoot the basketball and I'm not really making very many free throws or I just
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.960]   picked up a guitar and it sounds pretty terrible."
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   I say, "Yeah, of course.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   You got to train.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   You got to get your fingers stronger.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.400]   You got to find the muscle memory for the shot.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.640]   You're going to have to throw 1,000 free throws before it starts coming easier.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.720]   You're going to have to—it's going to take a lot of times trying to play that D chord
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.320]   before your fingers are able to hit it cleanly, but you will get better, of course.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.880]   It's not impossible, but it's not trivial."
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   That's what I'm trying to point out here is you can get better at this, and that's kind
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   of the big point here.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   All right.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.200]   Who do we got next?
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.960]   Next question is from W. "My company operates using the hyperactive high mind approach.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.820]   I've implemented all your tactics and I was promoted last spring, but I'm unfulfilled.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.800]   Should I return and finish my PhD to pursue academic work or lean more into my hobbies?"
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   All right.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.000]   Well, this is a—you got the special question here because the answer here is going to deal
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.560]   with lifestyle centric planning, perhaps not surprisingly, but I want to use this excuse
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:57.520]   to show off for those who are watching instead of just listening the latest piece of Deep
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.960]   Questions podcast sartorial gear.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   We've got new hats.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.040]   I'm going to put mine on here.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:11.840]   Hold on one second.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.280]   These are our new and improved Deep Questions hats.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:24.720]   So for those who are listening instead of watching, this is my VBLCCP hat now based
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.240]   on our feedback.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   Our man, Zachary Davey, who made these hats for us, has given me a smaller—I had them
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:37.920]   resized and put in the corner like a surfer hat—VBLCCP values-based lifestyle centric
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.140]   career planning.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.080]   This is an awesome looking hat.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.400]   Jesse is showing off a Deep Life hat.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   Looking good.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.280]   So I figured I'd put on my VBLCCP hat if we're going to give an answer about VBLCCP.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.080]   I do want to shout out Zachary Davey at CompanyOutfitters.net.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.360]   That's who did these hats for us, so hit him up.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.760]   He's got this company called Say It With Stitches.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.600]   So go to CompanyOutfitters.net if you want to get your cool gear.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   All right.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.640]   So with the hat on, Jesse, I am ready to go all lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   The hat messes with my earphones.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   It's interesting.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   It all sounds weird.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   All right.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:22.240]   So W, I'm going to harness the power of the hat and give you an answer here about lifestyle-centric
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.960]   planning.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:31.700]   Before you run out the door and sign up for a PhD program, let's get more strategic.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:36.560]   You need a broad vision for your ideal lifestyle.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.560]   This broad vision should be based on your values.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.600]   There's the V in VBLCCP, and it should cover all aspects of your life.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.080]   What does a typical day look like?
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.660]   What's the rhythm of your day?
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.440]   What does it look like around where you are?
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.060]   How does your work fit into this day?
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.000]   What is the feel of what your work is doing?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.680]   Are you stepping out of a rural home, the walk to a pond in the woods where you're going
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.880]   to be writing in a notebook with a coffee, or is it you're heading to like a galley loft
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.680]   in the city where there's all sorts of high-energy creative work going on?
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.400]   Is it a vision that's really centered around taking your kids to school and being there
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.680]   to pick them up on the way back and being plugged into your town life?
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.560]   Is it being a master of a universe type that's moving numbers and making bank?
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.080]   You got to get this vision.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.880]   Don't be specific about, "I live in this town.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   I have this job."
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.560]   Get the vision that resonates, this vision of your ideal lifestyle.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.320]   Working backwards from that vision is the whole ballgame.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.720]   That's how we figure out what you should do for your job.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.520]   And when you have this vision of the different aspects of your life and what it feels like,
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.840]   and you start thinking through all of the many different options you have to get closer
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.120]   there, a lot of options will come up for your job.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.520]   It might turn out that, "Wait a second.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:58.960]   My job is a fantastic engine for moving towards this vision.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   It's contained.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   Maybe it's hyperactive, but I can change that a little bit or it's okay because it's just
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.040]   9 to 5 and I like where we live and it opens up these other opportunities."
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.400]   Or maybe you realize, "Oh, this job is almost right, but the hyperactive hive mind element
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.720]   is making it really draining work.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.000]   Why don't I use my career capital to switch over to this lateral move within the organization?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.080]   It's not going to make me more money.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   In fact, maybe I'm going to lose a little money, but it's going to be more autonomous
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.200]   and the hyperactive hive mind aspect goes away, but otherwise we can still live here
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.400]   and the income and it allows me to work remote and my vision works out."
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.920]   Or maybe when you do this exercise, you realize like, "Oh, I got to get out of this job altogether.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.480]   We got to move to a different part of the country.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.360]   I need a completely different structure of work."
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.320]   All of these decisions become clear when you're working backwards from an ideal vision, a
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.880]   vision of the ideal lifestyle.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.120]   What you don't want to do is be reactive to feelings in the moment.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.520]   All right, so if you say, "Look, I don't know.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   I'm unhappy.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.400]   I think I feel unfulfilled."
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.160]   That leads to grand goals and this myth that a grand goal can solve everything.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.600]   So if I just quit and get a PhD, this will solve everything.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.680]   If I just like switch to a different job, maybe that'll solve everything.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:18.440]   Pursuing a singular grand goal rarely is going to fix all the issues because your vision
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.360]   of the ideal life has all these different attributes.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.200]   When you focus on just one thing, you're not only just ignoring a lot of those attributes,
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.640]   you might actually be making them worse.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.680]   Now, people don't like this.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.080]   Grand goals are fun because they're inspirational and we want to ride the inspiration like you
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.200]   ride a drug.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   So it's romantic.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   I'll get my PhD.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.800]   You don't want to think anything more about it, but follow through the storyline.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.440]   Pull this thread a little farther.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.480]   Where does it go?
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   Does it lead to?
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.320]   What's the lifestyle this leads to?
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.320]   What is it?
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.320]   You're going to be teaching somewhere?
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.120]   Well, it's not going to be probably a great teaching job if later in life, you're going
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.600]   back to a PhD, right?
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.240]   I mean, the tenure track types of romantic professor jobs like I have typically require
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.000]   that you're a hot shot out of college and go to a number one program like I did and
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.660]   really bust it for six or seven years and become a real force in your field and publish
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.160]   all these papers or whatever.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.880]   So you might just end up doing adjunct teaching and that's going to be frustrating maybe at
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.800]   this stage of life and not have the income you need.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.440]   Like you got to pull these threads and the best way to avoid again falling into this
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   trap is to work backwards from the ideal vision of a life well lived and not forwards towards
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.400]   a singular grand goal.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.880]   The other advantage of doing values based lifestyle centric career planning or as I
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.600]   typically in my book, Jesse, I'm just calling it lifestyle centric planning.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.000]   It's a bit of a mouthful.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.880]   I love it on the hat, which I am going to wear because this is how I'm going to find
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.640]   my tribe.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.960]   Probably so many people will know this, though I am kind of simplifying it.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.300]   The key to this is it gives you a sense of autonomy and improvement in your life right
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:58.640]   away and it might turn out as you work on all these other aspects of your life that
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   you're fine.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.220]   That like actually your unhappiness was not coming from the email frequency of your job,
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.840]   but there's all these other things that matter to you that were not being expressed.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   But your connection to community, maybe nature, maybe a sense of your mind and being able
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.440]   to be engaged in interesting ideas or a sense of productivity.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.040]   Maybe your job is very abstract and you have no sense of making my intentions made manifest
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.520]   concretely in the world and you feel unmoored.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.640]   Maybe it's just something about the neighborhood you live in and the rhythms of it and moving
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.440]   a mile away could change all of that.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.280]   It might turn out that your lack of fulfillment has nothing to do with your job.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.680]   Again, you can't figure this out until you figure out what it is I actually want.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.640]   So you need to do some lifestyle centric planning.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   All right.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:53.720]   Now that we have these hats on, Jesse, I think every question I have to bring back to this.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:59.040]   I feel like in a way it's kind of like golf in terms of because he alluded to the fact
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.440]   that he does lifestyle centric planning.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.120]   But even with golf, you figure one thing out and it's like, oh, well, but maybe this part
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.920]   of this wing isn't going to do something.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.200]   I mean, I would like to talk to him about what planning he's doing because when I hear
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.240]   someone say maybe I should go get my PhD, I know they're not doing lifestyle centric
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   planning right.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   Right.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:27.040]   I mean, unless it's, again, someone who is on the hotshot academic track.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.800]   That is the epitome of I don't know what to do and maybe this will fix me.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   And it almost never does.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.460]   I mean, look, I say my my rules for grad school, I say all the time, let me repeat them one
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.740]   more time.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:46.000]   Do not get a graduate degree unless there is a specific position that you want.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.160]   You have good reasons for wanting it.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.980]   And you have concrete evidence that the specific degree you are going to get at the specific
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.680]   place where you're going to get the degree will make that position available.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.700]   And if you don't, it's not right.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.380]   You have to have here is the concrete thing I want to do and why.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.080]   And I have evidence that if I get this degree from here, I can I could probably do this
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.620]   and I can't without.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.000]   Sometimes this is obvious.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.600]   Like I wanted to be a professor when I was at the end of my undergrad degree, I was trying
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.900]   to figure out what I want to do.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.900]   And I said, you know what?
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.560]   I think I want to be a professor if possible.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.840]   I want to make a run at that because I think the autonomy, the intellectual engagement,
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.160]   the focus on results, not pseudo productivity.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   That's what I really wanted.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   That met me well.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.440]   You'd have to have a Ph.D. to do that.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.280]   So it made plenty of sense for me to go to graduate school.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   And I had the hard evidence.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   Right.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.920]   I mean, I talked to my professors at Dartmouth, like, what does it take to become a professor
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   at a place like this?
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   And they're very clear about it.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.080]   Like, yeah, look, you've got to go to you're not at like a top five graduate program and
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   killing it.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   It's probably not going to work.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:01.640]   They get we get 300 applications, you know, newly minted doctorates for every position.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.800]   You got to be going to a top place.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   Right.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.080]   It's like, OK, I got into MIT so I can go to a top place.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.640]   And here's what it will take.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   Here's what you have to do.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.760]   And I was like, OK, so I know what I have to do when I get there.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.000]   Like, I have the plan.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I might not succeed.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.160]   It's very hard, but at least it was possible.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.240]   That makes sense.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:22.720]   Here in D.C., both in the government and in companies that work with the government, there
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.880]   are often just formal requirements.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.680]   You have to have a master's degree in one of these subjects.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.400]   We don't really care where it's from, but you have to have a master's degree in order
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.160]   to get X, this position or this contract.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.120]   So, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.200]   You're like, OK, in my career, I want to go from here to there.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.280]   I need to get one of these degrees.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.920]   And I know getting these degrees necessary.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.000]   And I know if I get this degree, it'll make it possible.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.720]   Yeah, of course, I'm going to go do that.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.760]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:59.600]   If you're in banking or consulting, to get to a certain level, you have to get an MBA.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   That's just how it works.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.560]   This is why I'm going to get my master's degree, because I want to be managing director at
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   Salomon Brothers or whatever, and I've been there for four years, and this is like the
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.000]   thing you have to do.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   That makes sense.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.200]   But if you're bored and unfulfilled and say, I don't know, I kind of like college, you
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.400]   know, my frat was fun.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   Let's go get a PhD.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.760]   That's not the right reason to do it.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.720]   All right.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.720]   We should get a hat.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.360]   Here's my new thing, and I think this would be great for YouTube.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:33.280]   We should have a hat for every single topic we deal with and just constantly switch them.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:39.360]   That way you're never-- there's no mystery around what we're talking about, just everything
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   we put on, put another hat.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   All right.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.360]   What do we got here?
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.360]   Do we have a slow productivity corner?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.360]   We do.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   All right.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   Let's hear that theme music.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:54.120]   All right.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.260]   Each week we like to identify one question that is specifically relevant to my new book,
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.180]   Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.440]   If you haven't bought that book, buy it now.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.000]   It is the cheat sheet for at least half of what we talk about here on the show.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   All right.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.040]   What's today's slow productivity corner question?
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   Questions from Yuri.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.160]   I'm a director of an innovation at a university in the Ukraine.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.360]   After three months here, I have a team of three and 37 open projects.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.160]   We joke that our goal is to choose what project not to start.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.720]   What's a good way to handle the pressures of our university to complete projects while
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.080]   also not overgrowing my team and causing burnout?
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.080]   All right.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   Well, this is a great example of a key principle from the book, Slow Productivity, where I
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.920]   talk about doing fewer things.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.520]   What I mean about that is exactly, actually, what we see here is don't do too many things
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   at once.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.120]   Now, IT teams, innovation teams, project-based teams, like the team being discussed here
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.560]   in this question, they're actually pretty good at this.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.920]   I'd love to hear—we have a—oh, oh, I see.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.960]   Actually, I've got to—I'm going to revise myself here.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.440]   Here's what I thought you were saying, Yuri.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.640]   So I'm going to tell you what I thought you were saying, and it's not what you're saying.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.000]   But then the thing I thought you were saying I'm very happy about, so I'm going to push
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   you towards it.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.500]   So what I thought you were saying is that you're working—your team is working on three
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:29.060]   projects right now, and you have a backlog of 37.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.560]   That's what I wanted to hear, right?
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.040]   Because the key principle is I don't care how many projects the university has pushed
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.640]   in your direction.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.720]   I don't care if it's 37.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.580]   I don't care if it's 307.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:48.200]   What I care about is how you decide how many you're going to be actively working on.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.720]   And with a team of three, you should be working probably on three projects at a time, right?
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:00.640]   And so the key here is your workload, your daily workload for the members of your team
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.200]   should be the same no matter how many projects are in your queue, because the number of things
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.000]   you work on at once is fixed, and it's the same whether there's 500 things waiting or
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   10.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.520]   All right?
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.200]   That is the way you have to deal with this.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.640]   Now, in slow productivity in particular, in Principle 1, this shows up in Chapter 3, where
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.320]   I talk about the principle of doing fewer things, I discuss a team at a—this is at
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:29.200]   the Broad Institute in Cambridge—and I talk specifically about, here's this team that
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.360]   is given all of these projects by the Broader Institute, their technology projects, tools
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.780]   they want them to build, systems they want them to innovate, that's going to make the
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.780]   institute run better.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.940]   It's a very similar situation, Yuri, to what you're talking about here.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.880]   And what they did that was very successful is that every potential project, they wrote
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.060]   on an index card and they put it on the wall, in a column they had marked off, like, waiting
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.580]   to work on.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.580]   Next to that, they had a column of currently working on.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.960]   And they had a note on each of the things in the currently working on, who's taking
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.940]   the lead on this, who's working on this.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.560]   And the key was, you couldn't have too much stuff in the currently working on.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.480]   You could lead one thing yourself, so if you have three team members, maybe you can have
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.720]   like three projects going on.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.480]   As soon as a project finished or hit a break point, like, okay, now we have to wait for
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.280]   feedback or whatever, they would move it out of that column and bring something new from
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.200]   the waiting to work on into the currently working on project—column.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.600]   As I report in the book, the number of projects they completed went up.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.880]   When they were working on a fewer number of things at a time, they could give it their
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.640]   full attention, complete them well, and complete them fast.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:45.540]   The rate at which projects were completed went up because they weren't having the overhead
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.480]   of trying to switch between too many things.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.520]   That's what you need to do, Yuri.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.200]   You need to have a wall where you have all the things we've been asked to do, and you
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.460]   have the wall of here's what we're working on, and all that matters is your limit for
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.600]   how many things can be in that here's what we're working on.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.840]   And the pressure from the number of things you've been asked to do should not affect
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.600]   the number of things you work on.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.780]   Work should feel like work, no matter how much stuff is queued up.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.080]   You should not be trying to work on more things at the same time.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.640]   There's no other real answer here.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.220]   Like, you can't work on 37 projects—it might as well be 3,000.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.240]   You can't work on 37 projects at the same time, right?
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.440]   There's only so many hours in the day.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:27.840]   So like, once you're past four or five projects, there's no more—you can't sustain an approach
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.880]   where you're like, "We'll just work on everything that's been pushed our way."
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   So be clear about it.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   Be clear to the university.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.920]   Be clear to anyone else who's giving you pressure.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   Here is how we work.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.800]   Here's our list of things we're queued up to do.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.920]   Here's the things we're working on.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.120]   We work incredibly hard and efficiently and with focus on the things we're currently working
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120]   on.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.280]   As we finish, we bring more things over.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.320]   There is no way to go faster.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.760]   You know, this is how fast this team can finish things.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.680]   You're welcome to give us feedback about prioritizing the stuff we're waiting to work on.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.160]   You're welcome to come in at any time you want and cross things off this list.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   Forget about this.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   Forget about that.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   Forget about this.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.080]   But we cannot change the number of things we're working on concurrently.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.880]   That's like squeezing blood out of a turnip, out of a rock, whatever the expression is.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.520]   Our time is our time.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.880]   We've saturated it.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.040]   This is how we produce the best work.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.600]   The big thing I try to advise in that section is like, we should do this even if you're
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.840]   not in a team, like really where knowledge work needs to get is that individuals are
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.840]   doing this as well.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:35.680]   You can push as much stuff at me as you want, but I work on three things at a time and as
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.920]   I finish things, I bring more things in.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.720]   That is the key, that sort of workload management, that binary differentiation between active
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:50.560]   and waiting is like the number one key for reducing burnout and it maximizes the rate
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.400]   of completion, which has to be the metric you care about, right?
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.480]   If I run an organization, it does not matter to me how many things you're working on at
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   once.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.520]   It does not matter to me how many things people say they're working on.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.960]   All I care about is the things to finish.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.120]   The rate at which things finish, how many things do we finish this month?
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.000]   How many things do we finish this quarter?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.320]   That's what matters.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:17.360]   And if you want to maximize that, you have to reduce and constrain the number of things
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.180]   you're working on at any one point, right?
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:25.520]   So look, I get into that in depth and slow productivity, but it's a critical point to
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.720]   making productivity more sustainable.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:33.520]   It's also our excuse, Jesse, to hear that theme music one more time.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   All right.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.520]   Now I feel relaxed.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.800]   You know what other music I find relaxing?
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.580]   So if you haven't, if you like that theme music and you have not listened to either
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:54.940]   of our in-depth episodes yet, our semi-regular Thursday episodes, listen to it for no other
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.140]   reason than the theme music.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:04.160]   And it's the same, let's give credit where credit's due, Kieran, who did the main theme
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.400]   for the podcast, the sort of techno nerd theme, which I love so much.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.860]   He did our kind of cool in-depth theme as well.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:17.560]   So for no other reason, you should listen to those episodes just to hear the cool guitar
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   music.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.600]   I think it'd be, so it's like guitar chords.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.040]   I think it'd be cool if like when you watched it on YouTube, it was just me rocking out
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.520]   on a guitar, just playing those chords and putting my guitar aside.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   That would be, that's how you get views, Jesse.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   Hats.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.080]   A lot of shredding your axe.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   All right.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   Let's get, let's get a call in.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   Sounds good.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.080]   Hey, Cal.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   Long time listener.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   Love the podcast.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   My question for you is this.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   I drive between 30 and 45 minutes each way to school every day.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   That's plenty of time in the car.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:54.800]   Normally I like to listen to audio books, music, podcasts, but I feel like I'm wasting
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.720]   this perfectly good time that I could be working my brain towards learning the material that
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.560]   I'm studying at the time.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:10.640]   So my question for you is this, as an engineering student, how can I maximize my productivity
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:17.240]   in this time while I'm driving when I can't necessarily just listen to an audio book on
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:23.320]   physics where it's more of a understanding conceptual formulas and that kind of thing?
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.880]   I love the show and I can't wait to hear your answer.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   Thank you so much.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.100]   Well, I have a similar length commute to Georgetown.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.160]   It's like 35 minutes.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:36.520]   So I can speak from personal experience of a couple suggestions here.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:42.880]   One, what I like to do is the morning commute, so the commute into school where you have
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.320]   your coffee and your energy is high, is a commute that I want to be productive with
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   quotation marks.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.480]   I'll define what I mean by that, right?
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:56.300]   But usually my drive home, I'm like, no, this is like unwind time, you know, especially
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:01.720]   if I can do a schedule shutdown ritual before I leave to come home.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.080]   Now it's podcasting, you know, let me listen to a podcast.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:10.440]   Let me listen to like an interesting book on tape and just take that unwind, especially
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.640]   after a hard day of school.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.480]   So first of all, I like that productive morning, relaxing afternoon.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   All right.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.240]   Now what do I mean by productive?
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.560]   You're not going to make progress on your engineering studies while you're driving.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.160]   Like, I don't see that happening.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.800]   So by productive, I mean intellectually engaging, interesting, like an exercise that if you
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.880]   did it, even if not in the car, you'd be like, oh, this added value or meaning or depth to
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   my day.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.200]   There's several things I do, so I'll just list them all and maybe some of these will
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   resonate with you.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:50.920]   One thing I've done before is I've gotten a book on a, not a book, a course, an audio
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:57.720]   course like The Great Courses, right, on a topic I'm interested in, but not, this is
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.340]   dead right in the middle of my research, right?
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:05.740]   So maybe I'll get a book on the big ideas of Western civilization or the history of
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.740]   Rome or something like this.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.100]   And what I would do when I'm going through one of these books is typically the lesson
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.580]   would fit with The Great Courses, the lessons would fit pretty well in like a 30 to 40 minute
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   commute.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.980]   I'm like, I'm going to pay attention to this on the drive.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:26.060]   When I get to my parking space, I am on my laptop in the car going to take notes on everything
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.180]   I just listened to.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:33.020]   When I build out this document of notes on like the course I'm taking, the notes will
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.760]   cement it.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.820]   But knowing that you have to write those notes is also going to get you to pay attention
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.900]   better to what's going on.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.980]   So that's one thing I would do.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:47.260]   The other thing I would do is I'll give myself like a particular problem I want to make progress
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.980]   on in my head.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.260]   Like, so for me right now, this will often be, I'm thinking about a book chapter that's
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.260]   coming up.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.060]   I'm like, how am I going to make this work?
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.980]   And I'll just, I'll think through as I drive and I'll think through different options.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.980]   What about this?
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.980]   And I'll let my thoughts unfold.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.820]   And then again, when I get there, I write down my thoughts before I leave the car.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.140]   So like you can do interesting brainstorming in the car.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.700]   Like you have your coffee, your motivation is high.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.900]   I'll do that.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.900]   I've outlined in my head podcast episode, deep dives, for example, I've done, I've worked
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.900]   on that.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:22.420]   If I'm working on an article, like a New Yorker piece, I might say, great, I'm going to try
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.860]   to figure out a structure here.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.980]   I don't like the way I'm getting in.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.100]   Let me try to figure something out.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.100]   And then when I get there, I'll take my notes.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:35.460]   If you have a hard time doing thinking in the car, there's easy practice for this is
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.740]   productive meditation.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.740]   Go for a walk.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.700]   You try to make progress on one idea just in your mind.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.140]   When your attention wanders, you bring it back to what you're thinking about.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:51.460]   This is a great way to sharpen your brain's ability to be facile with his working memory,
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.380]   to keep something in your working memory, to explore a piece of it and come back and
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:58.740]   update the working memory, what you need to think in your head, to write in your head,
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:03.820]   to structure in your head, to come up with ideas just in your head and remember them.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.820]   That's just practiced.
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.420]   So just do a bunch of productive meditation, you'll get better at it.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.420]   And then there's more you can do while you're actually driving.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.700]   So that's what I'd suggest.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.700]   You don't have to make progress on your engineering studies, but you can make progress on interesting
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.020]   ideas and thoughts in the morning.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.160]   And then the afternoon should be listening to the deep questions podcast.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.660]   So when you take out their computer after you park, you're just like, use like a word
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.660]   file or your notes file.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.660]   Word files.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:37.220]   I mean, you should have a bunch of word files or whatever you use for like ideas.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.900]   You're working on things you're trying to understand.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:45.300]   I mean, this is something I often preach, especially ideas like, okay, this feels important
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.300]   to me.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.060]   Something going on in the world feels important to me and I want to clarify my thoughts on
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.060]   it.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   Write it down.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.820]   Otherwise, especially if it's important to you, you're going to just be repeating stuff
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:04.980]   you've heard, be reactionary, or just sort of deal with group activation.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.940]   What do I think my group is supposed to think about this?
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.980]   Which is not like a bad thing, but like if something matters to you and you really want
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.700]   to have a considered understanding of it, begin recording your thoughts.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:17.100]   And you should be doing this about like a lot of different things in your life.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:21.600]   Like if you're a meditator, you should have a document somewhere where you're like, "Why?
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   Why am I meditating?
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.540]   What am I trying to achieve here?
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.140]   Why do I think this is important?"
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:31.180]   If there is like a political issue that pushes your buttons, don't just let your buttons
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.380]   be pressed.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.060]   Really try to understand it, right?
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:40.980]   If you're thinking about like the U.S. presidential election and you're a Democrat and don't really
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:48.320]   understand Trumpism, articulate like what the core principles here are, right?
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   What is it that upsets you?
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.300]   If you're a Republican, you don't like like the progressive left.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.380]   Like what is the core thing?
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.100]   What is the core principles here you dislike and why and what's your alternative?
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:03.740]   Otherwise, what you're going to deal in is just particular anecdotes and examples, exaggerations.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:11.540]   This happens so often, the gap between feeling and understanding, this gap is so common that
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.580]   you'll see this often where there's someone who feels very strongly about something but
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:16.580]   it's like a gut feeling.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.220]   My group hates this and I agree.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.220]   And they're just sure.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.580]   They get put in a situation where you're like someone challenges them.
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.020]   And they're so sure of like, "Oh man, like this is so wrong, I'm going to wipe the floor
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.100]   with this person."
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.220]   And then they find themselves, they're really struggling like, "Well, what about this?
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.260]   And I don't know like that or this."
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.700]   They struggle to articulate their feelings and you can see that frustration in their
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.700]   face.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.460]   It's because you haven't worked through your underlying feelings.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.500]   I think it's really important.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:45.580]   If you're religious, you should have a document that works through your theology.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.580]   Don't avoid it.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:51.560]   If you're political, you should have a document that understands, "Here's my political principles."
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.380]   If there's a practice like physical, you're really into, you know, I know someone was
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:03.460]   telling me the other day how going into extreme, awe-inspiring, natural settings is like at
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.900]   the core of their philosophy of life.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.580]   Work that out.
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.580]   Work out the principles.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.580]   Write it down.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.580]   Write it down, have word files.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.900]   So you should have a sort of this I believe folder somewhere that you're constantly working
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.060]   on because it gives you a more sophisticated understanding.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.380]   Your understanding evolves better.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.460]   You can build off it better.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.460]   You understand the world gets better.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.780]   So yeah, I think in general, that's a good exercise.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:27.080]   So just like one logistics question in terms of that.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.780]   So if you're using the Word files on your laptop, say people use like Google Drive or
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.780]   something.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:34.780]   Do you like merge them?
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.780]   Yeah, you can merge them.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:40.900]   So like if you really want to write after your commute in the parking lot, which I think
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.860]   works because like I just want to shut this down, you can write that in Word and then
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:50.660]   later on copy it like into a Google Drive if that's what you're doing or a Google Doc.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:55.900]   If you want to keep it accessible from different devices, some people will use the diction,
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.660]   the auto translation like in their iPhone and just like let me just say all the thoughts,
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.240]   all my notes about this now in the car and it like auto translated and like I email that
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.760]   to myself and then like later I'll actually put that into something else.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.660]   So I think all that's fine.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.380]   Or if you do it on your phone, you probably have internet on there already.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.140]   So like from the parking lot, you can dictate right into a Google Doc.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.280]   So yeah, I don't care about the tech.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:23.660]   But anyways, in general, it's good to have idea this I believe documents and more specifically,
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.060]   that's a good use of a morning commute.
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.440]   It's coming up with a way to update one of those documents.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.180]   All right.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.180]   Let's see here.
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.720]   I think we have a case study.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:41.820]   So this is where people write in to talk about how they have put my advice to work within
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.260]   their own life.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.380]   If you have a case I share, you can send it straight to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:51.920]   All right, today's case study comes from Amy.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.660]   Amy says for various reasons, I'll be attending a graduate program at the Berklee School of
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.640]   Music at 34 years of age.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:04.680]   My plan to succeed inspired by your advice is as followed.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.380]   Time block planning and fixed schedule productivity.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.140]   Being a fan of CALS for years, I've been time blocking off and on for a long time.
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:18.060]   Mostly on because when I do time block, my life is infinitely better than when I don't.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:23.660]   It's less about getting everything done and more about structure in my day-to-day life.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:28.340]   Two specific places for specific work.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:32.020]   Even after taking social media off my phone, I still noticed I was checking my email too
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.020]   much.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:37.740]   I took that off as well and now check my personal email on my computer at home.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.780]   Number three, no social media.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.900]   I've had problems with Facebook and Instagram in the past.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:46.900]   In fact, I set up a contract with my boyfriend to keep me accountable.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:53.420]   I believe that contract said if she violated it, she had to wear a VBLCCP hat for one week.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:57.580]   What's this, one, two, three, four, four.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.500]   Only have my school email on my phone, five, keep my phone on do not disturb or airplane
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.340]   mode during class.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.940]   If someone really needs me, they can call the school, that is true.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.460]   Six, the iPad I had to buy for my program is used only for schoolwork, practice materials
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.540]   and writing.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:16.060]   Seven, use the phone for your method, that's where you keep your phone plugged in, not
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.220]   with you while you're at home.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:23.660]   And eight, planning assignment, study and practice time way in advance.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:28.340]   Amy goes on to say, "I don't want to work past 6 p.m. and I plan to do most of my work
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.340]   on campus.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:34.180]   Since I'll be commuting to Cambridge from Quincy via the red line in the commuter rail,
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:39.340]   I will use the inbound time to prep and prime myself for the day and I will use my commute
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:44.340]   home as my schedule shut down complete, I'll report back later in a year."
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.620]   Oh, that's a flashback.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:51.540]   Commuter rail to Quincy station, red line from Quincy into Cambridge, just that's like
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.700]   me old Boston days.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.700]   She mentioned that.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:58:00.380]   Oh, I love the T. I might be going back to Boston soon, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.260]   Harvard Yale football game?
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.340]   It's not the Harvard Yale football game.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.860]   Go Big Green, Dartmouth fan.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:14.060]   It is a podcast, I won't say what name because whatever, but a major podcast, surprisingly
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.620]   records out of Boston.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.460]   So we're trying to find a time for me to go up there.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.220]   My guess is something with Alex Cora, why the Red Sox need help.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.220]   I wish.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:23.220]   I wish.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.460]   Yeah, I could help them out.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.660]   They need these hats.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:32.220]   This would be the home run celebration hat, should be VVLCCP.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.540]   They just don't hit many of them.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.540]   It's still, yeah, I know.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:40.460]   Let me tell you this, and I don't, look, I'm no expert in baseball, I believe in data.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:47.220]   I was in Boston from 2004 to 2011, Red Sox won two World Series.
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.060]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:54.180]   I don't say I get complete credit for that, but let's just say they have had much more
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.660]   World Series success when I was in Boston than not.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.660]   So-
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.500]   You were responsible for breaking the curse.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:04.100]   The curse was broken soon after I arrived, and I'll leave it at that, I don't want to
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.100]   get too much into it.
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.780]   We'll leave it at that.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.220]   Big Poppy loves Deep Work.
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.500]   Big Deep Work fan.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:18.100]   All right, Amy, you're going to crush it.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.960]   You're going to crush it.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.860]   That type of structure to your life, you are going to find that grad school is not that
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.500]   hard, and you're absolutely going to crush it.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.740]   I was very structured in grad school.
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.740]   I got bored.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.060]   I wrote books simultaneously with all the other stuff I was doing.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.520]   We were going to do great.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.520]   This is what it looks like.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.100]   I mean, let's bring this back to last Thursday's conversation with Oliver Berkman.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:46.180]   Oliver is rightly worried about obsession over productivity and trying to get more and
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:50.900]   more done and trying to deny the reality that we're finite.
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:56.020]   Those are all really good points, but I think the band of people that fall into that problem
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.620]   is relatively narrow.
[00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.340]   What I'm talking about with sort of humanistic productivity is exactly what Amy's talking
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.340]   about here.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:07.600]   This type of structure to her time and attention is going to make her time at Berkeley so much
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.100]   more sustainable and interesting and productive.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.860]   She's going to kill it in the program, and she's not going to be running around and be
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:19.300]   reactive and then get really sort of resentful about school and how everything's unfair.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.980]   She's going to be able to enjoy that commute, like as the red line gets near Quincy and
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.500]   you can see the water and that's all really nice.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.940]   After I fix the Red Sox, she can go to games at Fenway.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:36.060]   It's just going to be her life will be happier and better than if she was just instead being
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.380]   like let's just rock and roll.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.660]   For students in general, that's the case for most people.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.480]   That is a case study, I think, of humanistic personal productivity.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.100]   It's taking control of your time and obligations so that you can steer your life somewhere
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.100]   good.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.100]   She's not trying to optimize.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.100]   She's not trying to be the best.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.280]   She's not trying to get after it.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.980]   She's not trying to like, "I'm going to graduate early and I'm going to be the best musician
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.980]   ever."
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.280]   It's like, "Look, I want to do this thing well and not have it control my life.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.220]   So me controlling my life first is going to help."
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:08.980]   So I think it's a great example of humanistic personal productivity.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.820]   Productivity to make your life better, not to try to turn your life into an optimization
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.820]   puzzle.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:14.820]   All right.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.740]   We've got a cool final segment coming up.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.020]   I want to react to an author admitting what her greatest regret is.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:26.980]   First, however, I want to tell you about another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:33.780]   I'm pausing here for a second.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.220]   Oh, I fixed it.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.220]   Okay.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.860]   I had a Shopify script in front of me.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.860]   I said, "Wait a second.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.980]   We already talked about Shopify."
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.420]   It was an extra page I had left.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.900]   Who I really want to talk about is our friends at Mint Mobile.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:52.980]   I love a great deal as much as the next guy, but look, I'm not going to crawl through a
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.740]   bed of hot holes just to save a few bucks.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.740]   It has to be easy.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   No hoops.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.740]   No BS.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.140]   So when Mint Mobile said it was easy to get wireless for $15 a month with the purchase
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.460]   of a three-month plan, I called them on it, and it turns out it really is that easy to
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.220]   get wireless for $15 a month.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.740]   The longest part of the process is the time required trying to break up with your old
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.740]   carrier and not sign up for the new.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:21.820]   This has been relevant in our life because we have this really simple flip phone for
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.820]   our soon-to-be 12-year-old for when he has to take the bus to get to various places in
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:26.820]   case there's emergency.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.740]   We're like, "How do we put cellular service on this thing so he can call us or whatever?"
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.340]   Mint Mobile, oh, $15 a month.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.340]   It's cheap.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.340]   It's easy.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.340]   Let's get it done.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:42.780]   So if you want to get started, go to mintmobile.com/deep, where you'll see that right now all three-month
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.620]   plans are only $15 a month, including the unlimited plan.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:51.300]   All these plans come with high-speed data and unlimited text and talk delivered on the
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.300]   nation's largest 5G network.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.540]   You can use your own number with any Mint Mobile plan and bring, use your own phone
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.700]   rather, and bring along your phone number.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.980]   You can also bring along all of your existing contacts if you switch.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.100]   Find out how easy it is to switch to Mint Mobile and get three months of premium wireless
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.180]   service for just $15 a month.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.940]   To get this new customer offer and your new three-month premium wireless plan for just
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.540]   $15 a month, go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.060]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:26.500]   Get your wireless bill to $15 a month at mintmobile.com/deep, $45 upfront payment required, equivalent to
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.500]   $15 a month.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.780]   The new customers on first three-month plan only speed slower above 40 gigabytes on the
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.780]   unlimited plan.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.140]   Additional tax fees and restrictions apply.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   See Mint Mobile for details.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.900]   I also want to talk about our friends at Policy Genius.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:44.220]   Look, we put a lot of time as the holidays coming up right now, including the biggest
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:50.220]   holiday of all from my perspective, Halloween, plus all those secondary holidays that follow.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:53.540]   But it's a time coming up where you spend time with your loved ones.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.260]   This is a time to be thinking about life insurance.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:02.340]   Do you have enough coverage to support the people you care about if the unthinkable or
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.780]   the unexpected happens?
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.260]   41% of people don't.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.580]   Why?
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.580]   Because it's unclear.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.660]   How do I go get more life insurance?
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.820]   What is the process here?
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:20.280]   Policy Genius enters the scene because they make finding and buying life insurance a breeze.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.160]   With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies that start at just $292 per year
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.820]   for $1 million of coverage.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:34.860]   Some of these options have 100% online and would let you avoid unnecessary medical exams.
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:40.380]   All right, so when you go to Policy Genius, you're able to compare quotes with America's
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:45.420]   top insurers side by side for free with no hidden fees.

[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.620]   get on with your life.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.620]   They answer your questions.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.080]   They help handle paperwork and advocate you throughout the process.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.500]   If you are delaying on life insurance because it seems like a logistical headache, Policy
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.720]   Genius is your solution.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.020]   Save time and money on providing a financial safety net for your family.

[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   That's policygenius.com/deepquestions.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:22.500]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to our final segment.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:28.020]   So in our final segment, I often like to react to interesting stuff I have seen in the news.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.220]   Today I want to react to an article from the New York Times, an op-ed that many of you
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.220]   sent to me.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.220]   I have it on the screen here for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:41.140]   There's an op-ed from October 15th by the novelist Ann Patchett.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:47.220]   Here is the provocative headline, "The Decision I Made 30 Years Ago That I Still Regret."
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:54.700]   Now when I saw this headline, I thought it was going to be something grim.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   Like I don't know.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.500]   I was like, okay, this is going to be maybe like a, like a health thing or like a big
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.780]   moral quandary.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:09.260]   I was like, am I about to read that, you know, Ann Patchett murdered a hobo 30 years ago
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:13.700]   and hid the body there in Tennessee in like an oil drum and is now regretting it and is
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:14.700]   admitting it?
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.300]   Like I thought it was going to be dark.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.940]   That's not exactly what she was regretting.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.900]   And I was sort of surprised and pleased to see her answer.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.260]   All right, so here we go.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:32.140]   I'm reading from the third paragraph, "I signed up for email in 1995."
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:36.940]   She goes on to explain how email was signed up for an innocent reason.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.180]   She could communicate with friends.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:44.300]   She did it on AOL and now she regrets it.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.180]   Email is the thing she regrets most from the last 30 years.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:54.980]   Let me read you a quote here, "Because I do regret email.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.780]   Even though I've turned off the ping that once heralded every new message, I regret
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.820]   how susceptible I am to its constant interruptions.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.800]   I regret all the times I look only to find there's nothing there.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.620]   I regret the minutes it takes for my attention to fully return to other work at hand after
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.300]   stopping the check.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.940]   I regret how I can spend an hour a day writing back to people I've never met, explaining
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:20.580]   why I can't speak at their school or judge their contest or read their novel.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:24.660]   I regret how every person who hits reply all to the holiday message sent to a hundred people
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.420]   shaves off a few seconds from all of our lives.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:31.140]   Those seconds add up."
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.140]   Then she says, "Could I manage without it?"
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.420]   She says, "Well, look, people with smartphones look at me as if I'm the last of the carrier
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.420]   pigeons."
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:42.260]   So Ann Patchett does not use a smartphone, right?
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:43.980]   But she's okay.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.260]   So maybe the same is true for email.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.420]   So she's considering this article.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.620]   Do I really need email?
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.860]   And she says she is going to practice or potentially experiment with giving it up.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:02.260]   I like this article because it underscores a key point of my personal philosophy about
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.620]   technology which I call techno-selectionism.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:11.300]   I wrote a New Yorker essay about this last year called "It's Time to Fight Back Against
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.300]   the Technopoly."
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.820]   You can look that up if you're a New Yorker subscriber.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.900]   But here's the point about techno-selectionism.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:22.380]   Technologies have impacts that are hard to predict in advance.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:27.180]   And accordingly, the only sensible way to live in a world in which technology is going
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:34.660]   to play a big part of our advancement as a species is to be willing to continually re-evaluate
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:39.580]   and investigate the impact of technologies and be willing to step away or radically modify
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.860]   technologies after they were brought into your life.
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:50.940]   We have to get away from what I call techno-fatalism, where once the genie's out of the bottle
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:55.300]   or Pandora's box has been opened, we can't go back.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.420]   Smartphones exist.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.620]   We started giving them to our kids because we didn't know how could we go back.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.980]   Kids need social media.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:07.160]   We introduced email because the fax machine stunk, and this was better than voicemail.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.780]   And now it's taking over our lives and making work unsustainable and actually impeding the
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.980]   growth of productivity at a macroeconomic level.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.980]   What could we do?
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.700]   We can't just stop using email.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.620]   Ampatch says, "Why not?
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.620]   I hate it.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.620]   Let's change.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.460]   Yeah, it's hard, but this stuff's hard, too.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.180]   Let's do the Wayne."
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.180]   That's techno-selectionism.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:35.500]   We need to be willing to say, "Regardless of why we introduced this, regardless of the
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   reality that this technology exists, what is it doing it to us now?
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.780]   And if the answer is something really bad, let's be willing to make radical changes."
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   And when it comes to email, yeah, novelists like Ampatch can aggressively scale back.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.140]   You can't do that tomorrow in your job.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.180]   I get that.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:58.180]   But I wrote a whole book called The World Without Email that gets into what it would
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:03.260]   look like to build a workplace that was not dependent on all of this unscheduled back
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.260]   and forth messaging.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.360]   It's absolutely possible.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.100]   There's particular knowledge work sectors that actually do this.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.740]   Anyways, that's the type of thinking we need.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:15.460]   The current movement to take smartphones out of schools, that's techno-selectionism.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:21.020]   It's stepping backwards from what we did after we observed the impact.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:27.140]   Adults deactivating their social media account, that's techno-selectionism.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.460]   Yeah, it was fun or interesting in 2014.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.860]   It's a source of darkness in 2024.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.260]   I'm going to change.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.580]   Adults who are giving up their smartphones, techno-selectionism, adults that are rewiring
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.580]   their phones.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.780]   Okay, I have a smartphone, but it stays plugged in when I'm at home.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.780]   It's not with me.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.200]   I don't take it when I walk the dog.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.700]   That's techno-selectionism.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:52.820]   And we need more of that, especially as technologies have the ability to have impacts at population-wide
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.740]   scales and at very fast rates.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:58.380]   So anyways, good essay to read, Ampatch it.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.620]   My hat's off to you.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.620]   We got to get a copy.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.540]   We got to get a copy of A World Without Email to Ann.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.020]   She's got a great bookstore in Tennessee.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.160]   She's got to feature that book.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   She's got to know about it.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.900]   So look, if Ann Patchett's agent is listening, I want to send her some signed copies of World
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:13.900]   Without Email.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   I think we're on the same page.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.700]   But the broader message here is techno-selectionism.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.820]   We have to keep evaluating the impact of technologies that we've already admitted to our lives and
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.300]   be willing to make changes even after the fact.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.580]   What about in terms of like personal email and work email?
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.900]   Do you think she has it combined into one?
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.460]   She said earlier, it's a good question.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.420]   She said earlier in the essay she gets them separately.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.580]   And even then, it was still a problem.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.340]   So she took them both off her phone?
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.660]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.460]   We should get Ann on the phone.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:43.940]   You think she'd come on the show?
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:44.940]   Sure.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.940]   I think.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.740]   You're in Parade Magazine.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:56.060]   I am in ParadeMagazine.com, which means I'm guessing when the Premier Magazine Power 100
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.100]   Hollywood list comes out, I'm probably going to be top 10.
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:04.340]   I mean, how many people are featured in ParadeMagazine.com?
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.340]   Come on.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.220]   We should have her on the phone.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.300]   I think this is true.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.340]   It's possibly true.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.340]   So I've talked about this.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:16.700]   Actually, I think I've talked about this more on Tim Ferriss's show than this show.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:22.260]   But when I got started professional writing in college, I talked to an agent who was like
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:27.580]   a family friend to just figure out how the industry worked and what it would take for
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:31.260]   someone like me to get a book contract at the age of 21.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.780]   And it was a fiction agent.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.620]   So I was like, look, I'm not trying to sell myself to you, but just explain the world.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:41.060]   And once I knew the world, how it actually worked, I was able to get the book contract.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.420]   My vague memory is it might have been Ann Patchett's agent.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.540]   You know how you forget?
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.620]   It's been over two decades now.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.100]   Wasn't she a family friend?
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.100]   The agent was.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.100]   Yeah, the agent.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.100]   My uncle knew her.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   We can look that up.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.160]   I don't know how I'm going to look up here.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   I'm looking up one thing here.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.420]   This is there's nothing is more scintillating audio than someone looking something up on
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.420]   Google Live.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:08.180]   But let me look up one thing.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.540]   I have one one clue I'm pulling here.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.940]   Yeah, I think so, because here's my memory.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:21.980]   My memory that very vague is they had just had a big hit with Bel Canto, which was Ann
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:23.800]   Patchett's like big breakthrough novel.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.940]   So I think Ann Patchett's agent is responsible for me being a professional writer.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.940]   So there we go.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:30.940]   I should thank her.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.940]   And we should get Ann on the show to talk about email.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.940]   All right.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.740]   What I need to do, obviously, is save my voice.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.340]   I'm sort of losing my voice today.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:41.020]   And I have to go on national radio in Canada pretty soon, so I guess I got to go brew some
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.020]   tea.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.020]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.020]   Welcome to the life of a podcaster and author.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.020]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.500]   Remember, if you want to volunteer for the organization's studies, send a note to jessie@calnebrook.com.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:56.720]   We'll be back next week with another episode, and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.080]   If you like today's discussion of tactical and strategic procrastination, I think you'll
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:06.040]   also like episode 312 when I talk about productivity basics.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.720]   These are the key tools for fighting tactical procrastination.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.320]   They're a key partner to this episode.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.600]   I think you'll like it.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.840]   Check it out.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.540]   So what I thought I would do here would be to review five of the biggest ideas I've had
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.580]   about finding productivity in a distracted world.
