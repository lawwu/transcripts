[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.920]   - Pastor John, you said something happened to you recently
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.840]   as you were studying the Bible for yourself
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.520]   and you wanted to share it here and ask Pastor John,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.720]   please explain for us what happened.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.820]   - Well, it was on the Lord's day,
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.880]   I'm sitting on the front porch
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   and just trying to enjoy Philippians chapter two,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.840]   which is one of the richest chapters there is.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.120]   It begins with have the same mind among yourselves
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.960]   and don't do anything from selfish ambition or conceit,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.000]   but in humility count others more significant
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.440]   than yourselves and don't look just to your own interests,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.580]   but to the interests of others and have the mind of Christ.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.640]   And you know what that means?
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   He didn't hold on to his outward manifestations of deity,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.600]   but empties himself and becomes a slave and a servant
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.720]   and dies for us and rises.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.440]   And so work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.400]   And then I got to verse 14 of chapter two
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.820]   and the Lord really convicted me.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.280]   I was on the point of tears, really.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.960]   If I suppose if I'd let myself go,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.220]   I would have cried all the way,
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000]   but on the ring of tears because it says,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.260]   do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.120]   And I've read it a hundred times, more than a hundred,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.920]   I'm sure, without it having this effect on me.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.140]   Grumbling is another word for complaining or murmuring.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.940]   That word disputing is the word that,
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.280]   it's dialogus mois, it means reasonings or thoughts.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.320]   And so what I think it means is complaining
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.760]   is usually accompanied by all kinds of rationalizations.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   As soon as I get frustrated or angry or disappointed
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.880]   or irritated at something,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.920]   and I start feeling like, oh, maybe this is not good,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.360]   my brain kicks in with unbelievable rationalizing.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.200]   So when he says,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.920]   do all things without grumbling or reasonings,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.280]   he doesn't mean reason is bad,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.000]   he means this kind of reasonings
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   that the heart that's unbelieving
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   and self-defensive is producing, that's what's evil.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.120]   And here's what sank the arrow deep into my heart,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.820]   because the next verse says,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.400]   that you may be blameless.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.520]   Now, there's do everything without grumbling, Piper,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.240]   stop being a complainer,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.680]   so that you may be blameless and innocent,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.440]   children of God without blemish
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.960]   in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   among whom you shine as lights in the world.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   And I thought,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.840]   my light is my doing things without complaining.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.440]   So if I'm a complainer, I put my light out,
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.680]   and I live in a crooked and twisted and dark generation,
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.060]   what do they need, complainers?
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.600]   That's what they are.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.040]   Well, what good is a complainer?
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.800]   My light goes out, and I thought,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.440]   then I just, I stepped back and I said,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.760]   now, why is that?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.960]   What's the light that goes out when you complain?
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.920]   And the light that goes out is the light of his power.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.200]   I'm saying by complaining,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.240]   God wasn't strong enough to stop this thing
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.600]   I'm complaining about,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.480]   or the light of his wisdom goes out.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520]   He wasn't smart enough to keep this out of my life,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.840]   or his goodness.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.100]   He just wasn't, he doesn't have my best interests at heart,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.980]   so he lets this thing that I'm frustrated about
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.300]   come into my life.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.220]   And so the longer my complaining goes on,
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.820]   the more I put out the light of his strength
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.940]   and the light of his wisdom and the light of his love.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.780]   And that just landed on me, Tony,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.540]   with tremendous conviction.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.620]   And I had to go just pleading to the Lord,
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.940]   have mercy upon me.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.240]   Oh God, I'm just seeming to be wired to complain.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.120]   I see faults everywhere I look,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.380]   and I don't want to be this way.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.720]   I want to be a joyful person, an affirming person,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.800]   a hope-filled person.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.600]   And so I embraced afresh,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.000]   as we must do every day,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.200]   the gospel, ask for forgiveness,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.800]   and took heart that in his mercy,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.600]   this chapter is written precisely,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   not just to leave me there in my sadness and my misery,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.080]   but to say, he really is bright.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.520]   He really is light.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.540]   He really is strong and wise and good,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.720]   and he can help you not murmur.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.640]   So I think the way I would close
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.040]   this little confession is to just ask people to pray.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.520]   I mean, if they're saying, yeah, me too, well, fine.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.240]   I do pray for you 'cause I don't know who you are,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.400]   but you know who I am now.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.960]   And if you're a Christian,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.220]   you have some little teeny responsibility
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.560]   to join John Piper in praying
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.400]   that he wouldn't put his light out by complaining so much.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
