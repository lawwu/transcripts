[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720]   We're back with Francis Chan,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.540]   who was kind enough to join us today and tomorrow.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.360]   And Francis and his wife, Lisa,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.600]   are the authors of the new book,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.960]   You and Me Forever, Marriage in Light of Eternity.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.200]   And as you know, Francis,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.100]   men and women are postponing marriage later and later.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.480]   Even among Christians in the church,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.680]   this trend is happening,
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.200]   among couples with the full intent
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.760]   of eventually getting married.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.160]   So what is this trend doing to the church,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.960]   and what is it doing to the institution
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.360]   of Christian marriage?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.240]   I believe that at least 90% of those
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.640]   who are postponing, postponing,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760]   they're already sleeping together.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.320]   So they don't see a big need to rush.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.520]   There's no sense of, oh, I wanna get married,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.940]   you know, to really consummate this.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.380]   I mean, there's so much immorality in the church,
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.920]   and it's disgusting.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.120]   I mean, people need to know that God hates that.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.000]   Don't fool yourself.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   We're gonna get married anyway at some point,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.200]   and we're in love, and this or that.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.320]   And it's like, no, you don't understand.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   You're a temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   You're a member of Christ,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.760]   and you're joining yourself basically to a prostitute.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.400]   You're entering in a union
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.080]   that God wants nothing to do with.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080]   It's immoral.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.000]   And I believe there's more and more of that in the church.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.380]   It's becoming more and more acceptable,
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.600]   and it is still just as heinous in God's eyes
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.080]   as it's always been.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.640]   And so don't fool yourself.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.920]   I really do believe that that's the main reason
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.680]   why people are okay to postpone,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.480]   because sexually they're exploring and messing around
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   and dishonoring God,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.840]   and it's destroying the church in so many ways,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   'cause now they feel guilty,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.640]   that they don't feel like they can be used by the Lord.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.280]   And honestly, because of their unrepentant heart,
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.020]   their prayers aren't being answered.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.820]   And so I don't know if that's probably not the answer
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.060]   you're looking for.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.580]   But the other thing I will say too is
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.180]   I think some of the postponing of marriage
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.020]   is they're not seeing a lot of marriages
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.940]   they want to become like.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.480]   And so often you see these singles
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.160]   that are radically on fire for the Lord and serving him,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.540]   and then they get married.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300]   And once people get married,
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.000]   either they spend all their days enjoying each other
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.980]   and neglecting the mission,
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.920]   or they start fighting with each other
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.660]   and they're counseling all the time
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.140]   and ignoring the mission.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.940]   And so it doesn't seem really exciting
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.880]   to either idolize your family to the neglect of the mission
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.740]   or to be in such a desperate state of
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.660]   just trying to get along
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660]   that you're not really accomplishing anything
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.500]   for the kingdom.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020]   So that's another reason.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.740]   I don't wanna make it all about immorality,
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.420]   although I do believe that
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.460]   we're not doing so well in the area of purity
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.300]   within the church.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.100]   - Yeah, talk more about marriage on mission.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.980]   But maybe first, how old were you when you were married?
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.260]   - I was 26 and Lisa was 22.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.500]   And we were both virgins when we got married.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.260]   Three, two or three weeks into the marriage,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.100]   I looked at her and I said,
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.760]   I know we've never talked about this,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.380]   but suddenly I feel like God wants me to start a church.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.300]   And this would mean, if it's okay,
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   you work and support us, if that's all right,
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.060]   'cause I don't wanna take any money from the church.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.860]   I don't even know if anyone's gonna show up.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.020]   So that's how our marriage started,
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.060]   was like, let's gather some people in the home,
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.240]   let's start the church.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.820]   And eventually that became Cornerstone Church
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.700]   and ended up shepherding there for 17 years.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.500]   - That is marriage on mission.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.820]   How would you explain this conviction from the Bible?
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.380]   - I would just turn to 1 Corinthians 7
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.660]   and just explain from scripture
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.420]   what Paul is saying there about how marriage
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.140]   has the potential of distracting us
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.760]   from this undistracted devotion to the Lord
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.500]   and how he tells the married couples,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340]   hey, those who are married live as though you are not.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.300]   What's he talking about there?
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.620]   Why would the apostle Paul,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.380]   whose husbands love your wives,
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.820]   also say, hey, those who are married
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.500]   should live as though they're not?
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.780]   There's also another truth that there's something bigger
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.020]   than you just enjoying each other.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.900]   The time is short, and that's why he says,
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.500]   those who are married live as though you're not.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.060]   If you got a bunch of property, pretend you don't.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.540]   It's just like there's something bigger
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.140]   than the two of you.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.420]   And if you just spend your days enjoying each other,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.540]   you're gonna miss out on something greater.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.340]   And you also don't wanna set that example for your kids.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.700]   And it's also unbiblical.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.660]   - Thank you, Francis.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.620]   I have one more question for you.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.740]   A tricky parenting question that ever presses for clarity
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.780]   in many of our homes.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.340]   And I wanna know if you and Lisa have guidelines
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.220]   for how much time your kids invest in digital technology
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.460]   and entertainment and video games.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.700]   That's tomorrow with our guest, Francis Chan.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.900]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.500]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
