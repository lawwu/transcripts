[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.960]   - Our 144th consecutive week of episodes
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.660]   comes to an end today with a question
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.440]   from a podcast listener named Benjamin,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.080]   who writes in, Pastor John,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.720]   in his defense of Calvinism, Charles Spurgeon said this,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.360]   "There is no such thing as preaching Christ
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.280]   "and Him crucified unless we preach
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.360]   "what nowadays is called Calvinism.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.440]   "I do not believe we can preach the gospel
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.860]   "if we do not preach justification by faith without works,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040]   "nor unless we preach the sovereignty of God
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.280]   "in His dispensation of grace,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.660]   "nor unless we exalt the electing, unchangeable,
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.400]   "eternal, immutable, conquering love of Jehovah,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.940]   "nor do I think we can preach the gospel
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.740]   "unless we base it on the special
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.980]   "and particular redemption of His elect and chosen people
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.800]   "which Christ wrought out upon the cross,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.200]   "nor can I comprehend a gospel
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.000]   "which lets saints fall away after they are called
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.160]   "and suffers the children of God to be burned
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.700]   "in the fires of damnation
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.440]   "after having once believed in Jesus."
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.360]   Now back to Benjamin's question.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.680]   He asks, "Now I love Spurgeon.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.440]   "He is one of my most valued teachers,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.020]   "but it seems as though this would render,
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.640]   "if true, ineffective the gospel that Arminians preach.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   "Pastor John, what is your opinion?
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.280]   "Can an Arminian preach the gospel effectively,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.960]   "Christ and Him crucified?"
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.360]   - Okay, I love Spurgeon too,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.320]   and as he was unpacking those points
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.560]   about the foundations and the riches
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   and the heights of gospel truth, I was saying amen.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.280]   However, my answer is,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.840]   can an Arminian preach the gospel effectively?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.460]   Yes, he can.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.360]   Now notice, Benjamin did not ask,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.120]   "Can an Arminian preach the gospel fully?"
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.560]   He didn't ask, "Can an Arminian preach the gospel
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880]   "without implicit or explicit theological defects?"
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.000]   He didn't ask, "Can an Arminian preach the gospel
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.880]   "without tendencies that lead the church
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.920]   "in harmful directions?"
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.360]   He didn't ask, "Can an Arminian preach the gospel
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.100]   "in the most Christ-exalting way?"
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.800]   And my answer to all those questions would be, no, they can't.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.480]   What he asked was,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   "Can an Arminian preach the gospel effectively?"
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.080]   Which I take to mean,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.480]   can an Arminian speak enough of gospel truth
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.000]   so that God is willing to use it to save sinners?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.680]   And the answer to that is yes.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.100]   Now, let me say something about why I say this,
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.480]   'cause this is important.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   We need to not understate or overstate the issues here.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   Why do I say that?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   Spurgeon said, "There is no such thing as preaching Christ
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.600]   "and Him crucified unless we preach
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.120]   "what nowadays is called Calvinism."
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.000]   And then he impacts on what Calvinism means.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.960]   The problem with this way of saying it
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.780]   is that it creates an unrealistic picture
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.700]   of what really happens in preaching.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   He treats gospel preaching as all there
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.060]   or not there at all.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.340]   And when he says it this way, it's misleading,
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.820]   because in fact, preachers, Arminian and Calvinist,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.980]   always preach aspects of the gospel,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.780]   different ways of saying the gospel,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.420]   different emphases of the gospel.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.180]   And all of us use language in preaching
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.180]   that at least sometimes is not perfectly clear
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.660]   as to whether the words that we're using
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.040]   carry a Calvinistic meaning or an Arminian meaning.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.060]   They could go either way,
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.880]   depending on what you're intending by the words.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.820]   We don't always specify.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.580]   We can't, we can't qualify that often.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.500]   So whether you're a Calvinist or an Arminian,
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.220]   you can't qualify every sentence you speak
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.420]   as you preach Christ to make sure
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.820]   that every sentence carries a distinctive Calvinist
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.780]   or a distinctive Arminian meaning,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.800]   which means that the same Bible sentences
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.160]   about the death and the resurrection of Jesus
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.460]   will be quoted by both preachers,
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.140]   both Calvinists and Arminians,
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.140]   and God can use those Bible sentences to save sinners,
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.900]   even if all the Arminian
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.540]   or all the Calvinist implications of those sentences
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.120]   are not made explicit.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.300]   So here's the gospel.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.180]   Let's see if a Calvinist and an Arminian
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.660]   could say what I'm about to say.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.620]   I'm gonna preach the gospel now.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.340]   God is a glorious, all holy, all righteous, all just God,
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.940]   and created us for his glory.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   All people have sinned by not living for the glory of God,
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.900]   but preferring other things over God
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.620]   and thus dishonoring God,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.020]   and we are by nature rebellious,
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.940]   and we cannot change ourselves without divine help.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.940]   Therefore, we are all under the just and holy wrath of God.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.820]   We will all perish eternally
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.420]   if we cannot be saved from his wrath.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.380]   But God, in his mercy,
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.020]   has sent his own Son into the world, Jesus Christ,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.580]   to bear the sins and to endure the wrath
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.460]   for all those who believe on him.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.980]   Faith alone unites us to Christ
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.220]   so that his death counts for us
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.860]   and his righteousness can be imputed to us.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.320]   Everyone, therefore,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.100]   no matter how terrible your background has been,
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.280]   no matter what your ethnicity is,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.380]   or intelligence, or gender, or socioeconomic status,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.860]   or family background,
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.760]   everyone who believes, simply believes on Jesus,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.140]   that is, receives him as Savior and Lord and treasure,
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.260]   will be saved and have eternal life.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.660]   So turn from your sins and give up all self-reliance
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.480]   and trust in Jesus.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.500]   End of gospel presentation.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.700]   Now, I think both an Arminian and a Calvinist
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.580]   can say every word that I just spoke.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.580]   Now, of course, we know that at several points
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.060]   in that gospel presentation,
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.980]   our beliefs will take us in different directions
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.980]   as we explain those sentences,
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.100]   and those differences really do matter
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.820]   as people grow in faith.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.340]   These things are not, Calvinism and Arminianism
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.420]   are not a matter of indifference,
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.500]   but even before we make those differences clear,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.660]   these gospel sentences are true as they stand,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.340]   and God can make them effective
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.060]   in the mouth of both Calvinists and Arminians.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.780]   What people who hear believe,
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.860]   now, this is a crucial statement.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.280]   What people who are hearing the gospel
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.500]   believe when they hear those sentences,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.300]   what they've believed about what God really is like,
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.500]   that will become clear as people are taught
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.940]   the fuller, deeper truth.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.580]   And if the God they believed in,
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.580]   the God that appeared to them as glorious and desirable,
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.140]   proves not to be the true God
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.700]   and the true Christ of the Bible,
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.300]   that will become plain as truth is unfolded to them,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.560]   and the false believers will be revealed,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   and the true believers will be confirmed.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.380]   So my answer is yes, in this sense
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.500]   that I've just tried to unpack,
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.180]   an Arminian can preach the gospel effectively,
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.680]   Christ and Him crucified.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.580]   - There it is, wonderful.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.620]   Thank you for breaking that down for us, Pastor John.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.500]   And if you're listening to this podcast
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.740]   and you have never trusted in Jesus Christ
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.260]   for your salvation, maybe the gospel is new to you,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.300]   I would encourage you to listen to this podcast
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.900]   one more time and pray that God would give you faith
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.580]   to embrace this most glorious and most magnificent truth.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.940]   Well, the weekend is upon us now,
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.100]   a good time to formulate that sharp and concise question
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.020]   you've been wanting to send in to Pastor John.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.620]   And it's a good time to catch up on past episodes,
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.180]   all of which you can do through our free mobile apps
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.180]   and through our web home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.780]   John Piper returns with us Monday to talk to students
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.480]   who are feeling pressured at school
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.220]   for standing against the widespread celebration
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.540]   of gay marriage in our culture.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.540]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you then.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.120]   (upbeat music)
