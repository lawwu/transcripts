[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Today is the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.200]   And Pastor John, on a day like this, I think listeners may be interested to hear of your
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.400]   involvement in the anti-abortion demonstrations back in the 1980s and 90s.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040]   Share with us where that burden came from, how many times you've been arrested for trespassing
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.920]   because of it, how much time you spent in prison, and then maybe, if it's not too much,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.340]   maybe a principle or two for how you think through civil disobedience in the defense
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340]   of the unborn.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.520]   There was a season in the late 80s and then the early 90s, maybe about three years, where
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.680]   I was deeply moved by the rescue movement that originated pretty much, I think, in Atlanta.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.600]   Noel and I were sitting in a pizza hut, watching the monitor of a television show, watching
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.720]   people being picked up by the police, put into buses and dragged away, who were not
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.920]   doing anything but sitting there in front of an abortion clinic.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.080]   And as I watched that happening, I said to Noel, "That's right.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   That's just right."
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.460]   It just came over me with such a strong conviction.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.600]   And the rescue movement grew and lasted for two or three years, and we became very much
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.880]   a part of it here in the Twin Cities, which means that we would get up early, pile into
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.480]   buses and go sit in front of an abortion clinic so that nobody could get in without stepping
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.080]   on us or opening the door.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   And then we would be accused of trespassing and they would tell us to leave.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.960]   And we wouldn't leave because we believed that we were there to try to rescue children
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   from being aborted.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040]   And so the police would come and pick us up, put us on buses and haul us down and let us
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.080]   go, usually after they had told us not to do it anymore.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.960]   That happened, I don't remember how many times, maybe, I don't know, half a dozen times.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.800]   One of those times, we were sentenced to one night in jail.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.640]   It might have been two.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.440]   And here's just a little anecdote.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.960]   Spending that night, and next door to me in the cell was another member of our church
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:27.160]   named Rod, and we were talking through the night about this and he said, "You know, there
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.960]   are other methods we could use."
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.800]   And there was born in his heart the MICA Fund, Minority Infant Child Adoption Help, out of
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.720]   that experience in which we created a fund that still exists for helping people adopt
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.960]   little babies who were rescued from abortion.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.680]   But the principle behind this was Proverbs 24, 11, "Rescue those who are being led away
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.920]   to death, hold back those who are tumbling to the slaughter, if you say, 'Behold, we
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.240]   did not know this, does not he who weighs the hearts perceive it?'"
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.440]   That was a very powerful text for me, because these children are being led away to slaughter,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.400]   and if the power to resist is there, then use it.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.840]   The way I think through civil disobedience is fundamentally to say, number one, that
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.520]   submission to the state, according to Romans 13, 1-4, is right.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.160]   I try to keep the speed limit, I drive on the right-hand side of the road, I pay my
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.760]   taxes, I cut my grass, I don't shoot squirrels in the city limits, I obey a hundred laws.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   I think I should.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.200]   I think I should submit.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.840]   But the law of God, and submitting to God, takes precedence over that.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.160]   The Apostles said, "Whether in your eyes we should do what you say, we must obey God
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.120]   rather than man," and that text was driving me to say, in this situation, at this time,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.280]   this method of rescuing seems right.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.480]   I was putting myself in the situation of the midwives who were saving babies by breaking
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   the law of Pharaoh, or you can point to other instances like Esther, who said, "It's
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.320]   against the law to walk into the King's presence without being bidden, but if I perish,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.520]   I perish, I will go and risk my life," and he lifted the golden scepter and she saved
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   her people.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.800]   That seemed like a parallel to me, to go against the King's ordinary laws.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.880]   One last principle is, our own laws, I think, are being undercut by this.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   I think the principles of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence say, "Life,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.600]   liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all our people," and we're denying that
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.800]   so that the laws that protect abortionists to kill children are laws that are contradicted
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.480]   by other laws, and so our country has already, I think, given a green light to those who
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.400]   would say, "No, you can't do this."
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   One last comment, how did it go?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.080]   I think it made a significant impact, and I think for that season, it was a good strategy
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.360]   and I don't regret being involved in it.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.880]   The reason it didn't continue, I think, is because partly the price became very high
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.560]   for a lot of people, and people lost their livelihoods and people got sued and lost their
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   possessions, but mainly, I think, it's because the Christians, we ourselves, could not maintain
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.600]   the kind of suffering, humble, quiet attitude that would win the day, as in the civil rights
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   movement.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.480]   There were just too many loudmouth, feisty, pro-life people that couldn't keep their mouths
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.800]   shut when we were mistreated by the pro-abortion people that were there or by the police, and
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:27.680]   since the spirit was lacking in so many, it backfired, and so it ceased to be an effective
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.480]   tool in the rescuing.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.440]   Whether God may raise up some other means like that along the way, I don't know, but
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.080]   for now, I think everybody should obey that text in some way or other.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.840]   Rescue those who are being led away to death.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.040]   Hold them back from the slaughter.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   You already know what's right here, so do something for the sake of life.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.400]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John, for sharing your story and for encouraging all of us to get
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.980]   involved in some way.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.720]   For more on this subject of abortion, see the e-book titled "Exposing the Dark Work
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.120]   of Abortion."
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.520]   The e-book contains a collection of three John Piper sermon transcripts, and it's available

[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.880]   And if you have a question for Pastor John, please send it to us via email.

[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.040]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
