[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.280]   - Welcome to the BogleHedge Chapter Series.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.440]   This episode was hosted by the Chicago Virtual Chapter
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.600]   and recorded April 15, 2021.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.480]   It features Lauren Bolin, the developer of Seafire Sim.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.600]   BogleHedge are investors
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.040]   who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.600]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.960]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.480]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.280]   - All right.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.380]   Well, thank you for inviting me, Jim,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.540]   and whoever else was involved in that email chain.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.980]   My name is Lauren.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.640]   I am the developer and creator of this site
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.000]   called Seafire Sim.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Let me, I'm gonna start sharing here.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.440]   - Yeah, I'm gonna stop sharing.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.240]   - Which screen?
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.080]   This one.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.400]   - Yeah.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.240]   - Okay.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.880]   Bear with me.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.160]   All right, so I'm the developer and creator
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.960]   of this sort of retirement back-testing calculator
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.340]   called Seafire Sim.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.920]   Sort of a mouthful.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.060]   Marketing and SEO are not my thing.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.040]   I developed this sort of in 2013,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.520]   actually as a side project,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.760]   and it's sort of been this passion project of mine.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.140]   I have a very loose agenda here.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.520]   There are a lot of things on this calculator to go over.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.680]   I'll try to hit at least every one a little bit.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.920]   We can go into more depth
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.400]   if people have questions on specific things.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.000]   And always, you know,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920]   one of the most important things about my site
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840]   is the first word, crowdsourced.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.180]   I really like to take other people's input.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.920]   When I was developing this thing,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.280]   the whole reason I developed it
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.360]   was because of other people's input.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.080]   And I'll get into that a little bit on the history.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.480]   So at the end, if your question isn't answered,
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.040]   my email is at the top of the website.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.960]   You can feel free to contact me anytime.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.060]   Plenty of people do.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.840]   So here's sort of a rough agenda I'm gonna go over.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.960]   Just sort of introduce myself a little more.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.980]   I talk about how I developed this project
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700]   and go over a little bit of my sort of development practices,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.280]   which I won't get too much into the tech details
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.000]   or tech nerdery,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.560]   but I have a little bit of information out there
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.600]   if you're the kind of person that's interested.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.560]   Then I'm gonna sort of go over basic functionality
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.380]   on the site, some of the more advanced features.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.480]   My favorite part of the site,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.620]   which is the different spending plans.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.400]   And then I'm gonna go over some sort of fictional scenarios
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   to show you how someone would use it given your situation,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.880]   whether you're paying for two kids college
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.220]   at two different times,
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.000]   or maybe you're still saving for retirement,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.020]   or maybe you're gonna have a part-time job in retirement.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.280]   All those things can be done on this tool
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.360]   and it's kind of useful.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.060]   Then at the end, I can talk about any sort of questions.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.700]   So before I go anywhere,
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.820]   I guess I'll introduce myself again.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.020]   My name is Lauren.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.980]   I'm a software developer by trade.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.520]   Me and my wife lived in the suburbs of DC.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   We have two kids and I've been interested
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.260]   in sort of the retire early, the fire movement,
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.940]   probably since 2008 or nine,
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.920]   when your money, your life was really the only resource.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.780]   I was kind of really involved in the internet
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.380]   when it became more of a blogging thing
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.660]   with Mr. Money Mustache and various other people.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.540]   And now that sort of movement is quite rampant out there.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.100]   And I'm happy to see it.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.240]   At some point in my life,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.500]   I was a moderator on Mr. Money Mustache forums,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   was a moderator on the Reddit financial independence site.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.860]   So I've been around.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.740]   So a little bit of history about Seafire Sim.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.060]   Really this project was born out of conversations I had
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.380]   with people on earlyretirement.org.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.180]   So for those of you who don't know,
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.540]   I mean, I think most of you would,
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.180]   but earlyretirement.org is sort of the forum website
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.600]   that happens to be attached to a website called FireCalc.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.540]   FireCalc, if you look at it today,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.820]   is really a sort of retirement calculator
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.660]   that looks like it was written in the '90s.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.660]   And I believe the data is updated yearly still.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.420]   But the reason it hasn't been updated,
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.160]   and not to diss them honestly,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.100]   'cause I like their project in general,
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.300]   but the reason it hasn't been updated
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.880]   is 'cause the person sold it.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.120]   He retired and is living on a boat as far as I know.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.860]   So bravo to him.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.880]   But the folks at earlyretirement.org get a lot of clicks
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.160]   for having that site up there.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.440]   So it's good.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.300]   But in, I'd say around 2011 or 2012,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.640]   I was hanging around on those forums,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.920]   and it was pretty clear
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.040]   that there were people asking for new features
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.080]   on this website.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.840]   No one was there to make those new features.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.680]   So it was a lot of people sort of screaming into the void.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.280]   I was not a software developer at the time.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.640]   I was trying to learn it.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.620]   And I thought that, hey, this would be a great project.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.440]   One of the things that was useful for me
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.960]   is that FireCalc outputs a CSV file at the end.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.880]   And it's kind of a mess,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.320]   a lot like cfire-sims-csv,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.920]   but it's essentially a data dump
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.140]   of every single iteration of the simulation.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.280]   So I figured if I looked at this long enough,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.560]   I could reverse engineer it and figure out what's going on.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.840]   And it turns out it was right.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.460]   I think it took me a month of nights and weekends
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.260]   of just sort of going through the steps
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.020]   to figure out what was going on,
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.740]   how they were applying inflation
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.420]   and doing all the calculations.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.940]   But I did reverse engineer it,
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.900]   and I started putting some code out there.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.820]   I took a lot of input from folks on that forum
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.280]   and from folks on Reddit and other places during that time.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.320]   There's a couple of people who are either on this call
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.760]   or will be listening that were a big part of that.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.560]   I've never actually heard his name said out loud,
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.020]   but Jerome Moisand is a Boglehead in your group
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.720]   that was a big help back then.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.320]   And there's a user named Ciamond
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.280]   that also I spoke to quite a bit about 10 years ago.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.680]   So if you're out there, thank you for your help.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.160]   And anyway, I put this project out there in 2013,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.520]   and personal finance and FHIR is sort of my thing.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.560]   And I actually used it as a way to shift my career.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.380]   Now I am a software developer by trade,
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.360]   so it's great to be paid for something that you like.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.600]   But real quick,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.920]   going over sort of general development practices
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.000]   of how this tool work or how I work on this tool
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.720]   for any of you nerds out there.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.760]   I host this on a platform called DigitalOcean,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.200]   which I believe just had an IPO recently.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.600]   So go DigitalOcean, I am not an advisor.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.240]   Don't take my word for that.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.520]   I sort of viewed the websites written in Python
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.780]   and a framework called Django as a MySQL database.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.600]   And I use a lot of Docker containers.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   And of course, there's some JavaScript written in there
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.260]   for the form magic that you see.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.440]   In the past, I've written it in PHP.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.480]   Then I rewrote it completely in AngularJS.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.980]   Then I rewrote it completely in Python.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.280]   So it's gone through a few iterations.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.660]   One of the things I know a lot of people are concerned about
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.220]   is testing.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.580]   How do I go about testing this?
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.600]   When I add a new feature, does it change the outputs?
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.720]   This is kind of a tricky question.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.360]   Some of the time, it does change the outputs.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.980]   And the question is whether or not that's the intended thing.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.640]   I talk to a lot of people when I make changes
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.000]   that actually affect the outputs.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.660]   A very big example of this is I would say sometime in 2014,
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.120]   I'll provide a link that we can attach to this video
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.360]   or the thread in the Bogleheads forum.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.720]   But sometime in 2014 or so,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.200]   someone came up to me in the forums and said,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   "Hey, how do you calculate the bonds on your site?"
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.000]   And I gave them the formula that I'd been using.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.300]   It's based on the GS10 long interest rate
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.720]   that's publicly available data
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.960]   that's gone back for 150 years.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.180]   Someone's printing in my office.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:08.160]   They came to me and they offered some information
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160]   and we sort of hashed out the mathematical formula.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.740]   Well, it turns out that...
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.240]   Sorry, this is really loud and bothersome.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.900]   How many pages?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.320]   It turns out that the FireCalc and a lot of different sites
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.560]   were calculating the bond rate incorrectly.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.360]   We sort of went over it as a group
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.440]   and came up with a slightly different formula,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.680]   which actually affected some of the success.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.080]   I would say that there's probably a two or 3% difference
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.320]   in success rates between CFIR-SIM and FireCalc
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.180]   given the amount of bonds you have in it.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.080]   So this is sort of like an interesting point in testing
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.720]   where it's just gonna be different.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   I do have lots of unit tests.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.960]   And for those who are not software developers,
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.320]   sort of unit tests are pre-built tests
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.880]   that have predetermined outcomes.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.240]   And every time you make a change in your software,
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.640]   you can just run them immediately and see what happens.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   If those predetermined outcomes are different,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.040]   it will let you know.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.580]   So I do keep an eye on that.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.520]   Honestly, the biggest thing that I rely on is user testing.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.680]   Almost, I would say 95% of the bugs that happen on my site
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.580]   are just UI bugs.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.720]   I was mentioning to Jim before everyone came on
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.640]   that JavaScript is the programming language
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.880]   that lets you kind of mess around with the UI.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.800]   That's not my day job.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.400]   I'm not used to doing anything with JavaScript.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.620]   So sometimes little UI bugs get in there.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.360]   And lastly, I've mentioned this before,
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.080]   but I always take advice from users.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.840]   I'm always looking for new features
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.880]   or quality of life things.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.760]   I don't wanna make this thing too complicated in the end.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   So I reserve the right to shoot things down.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.280]   But over the years, I've added a lot to the site
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.360]   based on suggestions and it's been great.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.160]   All right, all right.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   That is basically some of the back end history of this.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.680]   And I'm gonna go through some of the basic functionality
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   on the site and see if any questions arise.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.320]   So I'm gonna refresh this just in case.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.200]   When you arrive here on the site,
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   you're presented with what I call the giant form.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   There's a lot of inputs here.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.280]   You can open it up depending on what you select
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.720]   for even more inputs.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.400]   But there's sort of this basics section
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.160]   that I'll go over in the beginning.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.800]   A little bit of the back end data is to know
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.560]   is I go off of Robert Schiller's dataset,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.240]   which is pretty common.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.200]   Robert Schiller's dataset has like sort of the S&P 500
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:28.040]   equivalent stock index for the last 170 years
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.480]   and also has the bond rates.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   And I also have a separate data source for gold.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.440]   One thing that I would say is lacking in this program
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   is historical cash data.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.320]   I've never been able to find a good historical cash data
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.560]   that goes back all the way to 1871.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.880]   There's quite a few that go back to 1900
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.520]   and I've never bothered to sort of jam those together.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   So that being said, I offer the ability for you
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.080]   to put in how much cash you think,
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   how much growth you think cash will have in your portfolio.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.120]   Maybe this is a lesser tended to feature
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   because I don't have a lot of cash, but.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.000]   So the basics here are sort of,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.520]   I would say pretty common for a lot of retirement calculators
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.360]   you have a retirement year,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.760]   you have a retirement end year,
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.680]   better known as your mortality.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.400]   You have sort of a check here
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.920]   for what kind of data you wanna use.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.000]   I almost always use all historical data,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.080]   but some people like to really nitpick
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   on the worst periods of history
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.800]   and see if their portfolio would have survived,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.000]   which is useful, but I mostly like to see everything.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And then you sort of have your portfolio value
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.640]   as it stands now, which is important.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.160]   And then what your yearly spending is now in today's dollars.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.920]   So I'm not gonna assume people's knowledge here,
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.120]   but everything on this page
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.360]   is essentially in today's dollars,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.240]   which means you don't wanna inflate
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.880]   these numbers for the future.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   If you're gonna retire in 30 years
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.040]   and right now you're spending $40,000 a year,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.880]   sure, maybe in 30 years, that's gonna be $70,000.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.440]   Don't put that in this calculator.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.320]   Everything is in today's dollars.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.160]   I personally find it easier to wrap my brain around
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.000]   when everything's in today's dollars.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.840]   And everything does get adjusted by inflation
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.360]   as you'll see on the output.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.080]   So initial spending.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.680]   Spending plan is something I'll go over later.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.800]   There's quite a bit in here,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.640]   quite a bit of complexity in there.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.400]   But right now, this is inflation-adjusted spending,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   which will adjust this initial value up and down
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.240]   based on historical inflation,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.760]   which is a pretty common feature
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.160]   in I think some of these calculators.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.600]   Here's sort of a dropdown
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.480]   for what kind of inflation type you have.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.840]   So this is CPI, this is the historical inflation.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.440]   You can do your own flat rate inflation
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.760]   if you really want to.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.520]   Some people like to use this for sort of bad scenarios
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.560]   where they're like, oh, maybe inflation's gonna be 4%
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.600]   for the rest of eternity,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   or maybe it's gonna be 2%.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   I'm not sure, but I tend to use historical myself.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.920]   Those are sort of the basic things
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.640]   that you need to run this in general.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.760]   Everything else below here is sort of adding details
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   to make it more of a fine-grained simulation.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.200]   So like I mentioned before about cash,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.280]   here's your portfolio area.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.920]   Important to note that this is essentially the portfolio
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.000]   that's gonna be throughout your simulation.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.920]   Now, you may ask, I'm gonna change my portfolio,
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.360]   maybe I'm gonna get more aggressive,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.800]   or maybe I'm gonna get more conservative
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.000]   as I get closer to retirement.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.920]   You can do that.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.720]   I do have the functionality in there
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.280]   to provide what's called a glide path,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.760]   which sort of takes your allocation at one point
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   and moves it slowly to another point
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.840]   over a certain amount of years.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:51.120]   So the default here is 75% equities, 25% bonds.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.000]   I think this is a pretty standard default
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.920]   for a lot of retirement calculators.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.520]   If you want to do those glide path type things,
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.000]   you would uncheck this, keeping the allocation constant.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.240]   It will reveal a new panel here.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.360]   And so in this particular situation,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   this person is retiring in 2021, which is this year.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.960]   There are some financial gurus that seem to think
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.160]   if you start off in a conservative portfolio
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.880]   and slowly move to a more aggressive one during retirement,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.440]   that that's a viable thing.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   So I wrote in here,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:49.600]   we're starting off with a 50/50 portfolio,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.200]   and here is the start year of the glide path,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.560]   and here's the end year of the glide path.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.360]   So over a 10-year span,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.360]   it's gonna slowly ratchet it up to a 90/10 portfolio.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   I would say one of my personal to-do lists for features
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:18.680]   would be to add the ability to do more than one of these.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.440]   I think it's pretty common for people
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.760]   to change their allocation
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.520]   throughout their investment careers multiple times.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   So I wish I could do this twice or three times,
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.480]   but right now you have the ability to do it once.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.120]   For simplicity's sake, I'm gonna hide this for now,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.800]   but this can be pretty useful
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.400]   in trying to model different risk scenarios.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.440]   So I'm gonna click this button
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.680]   and make that thing disappear.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.080]   You'll sort of notice that a lot of things on this website
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.400]   appear and disappear based on your inputs.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.320]   Hopefully that that's intuitive.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.840]   I haven't found a lot of people have a problem with that,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.080]   so hopefully it's not too bad.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.240]   Rebalance annually is an interesting thing.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.960]   I don't know your own personal views,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.440]   but I think most folks that are interested
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.600]   in planning their own retirement
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.760]   are rebalancing annually or twice annually.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.000]   I mean, maybe people are doing it every quarter.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.040]   I don't know.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.440]   All this means is it's rebalancing your funds
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.440]   back to this portfolio every year based on the simulation.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.320]   If you don't do that, it'll just let the simulation drift.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.080]   It'll let your equities go up and up and up
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.880]   or your bonds go up and up and up
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.320]   during certain times in history,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.840]   and it'll never rebalance.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.920]   That's certainly an interesting thing to simulate.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:56.200]   You can try it out on your own and see the effects of that.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.040]   And lastly, one thing I haven't mentioned here is fees.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.120]   This is essentially the average fees
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.920]   across your entire portfolio.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.440]   I know that that's not ideal.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.080]   People have different fees and different accounts
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.200]   because they have different funds in them.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.920]   For the purpose of simplicity,
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.240]   I put this in here as just an overall average
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.520]   on your portfolio.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.880]   This is like some sort of average of Vanguard funds
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.960]   that I found out there, so I put it in there.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.800]   All right, below portfolio,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.760]   we start getting into some of the inflows and outflows
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.280]   that you can add to your simulation.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   And starting with the most popular,
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.800]   at least in the United States here,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.040]   I do have several people from Australia and the UK
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   that visit this site and make use of other adjustment types.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.840]   But since I'm in the US
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.480]   and I will be collecting Social Security hopefully,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   I added this.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.240]   So we have two different Social Security fields,
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.520]   one for yourself, one for your spouse.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:22.360]   By popular request, I've made it so that you can change this
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.920]   from a monthly to an annual number.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.520]   I used to have everything annually,
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.600]   but most people think in monthly terms
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.320]   when it comes to Social Security,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.520]   how much am I getting each month?
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.120]   So whichever you put in there,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.920]   it will do the right thing on the backend of the simulation.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:47.880]   Of course, you can model different start years.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.680]   I know lots of people try to figure out
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.640]   whether it would be worth it to take Social Security early
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.960]   or take it at the full retirement age.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.080]   You can certainly do different simulations
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.640]   based on start year.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   And of course, I used to not have an end year in here.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.360]   I used to just assume, hey, this is gonna be,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.200]   you're collecting this for the rest of your life,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.800]   but lots of people want to model their spouse's deaths.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   So I added an end year in here
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.960]   and you can model different people's deaths
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.120]   and changing of values in here.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.880]   So this is essentially one example
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.120]   of what I call an adjustment.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.920]   It's sort of a general term for the inflows and outflows
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.440]   of money in your portfolio each year in the simulation.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.040]   A pretty common theme, and I'll show you right here,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.680]   this is the generic,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.960]   this is the general adjustment section.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.000]   So you can put up to,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.960]   I believe I've allowed up to 10 adjustments in here.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   There's no reason I couldn't increase it.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.760]   I just have kept it at 10.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.440]   But this is essentially where you would put your pensions,
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.960]   where you would put a different spending things
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.200]   that would happen during retirement.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.360]   Maybe you're gonna retire
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   and then you're gonna start paying for your kid's college.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.880]   So you know, my kids are gonna be in college in 2030.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.800]   And then I've got another kid in college, 2033.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.640]   So I would model a couple of different spending things.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.560]   Good old in-state tuition in Virginia right now
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.880]   is roughly 15,000 a year.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.000]   So this is sort of a general thing
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.720]   that you can do with these adjustments.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.120]   I have pension availability in here,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.960]   any sort of income and savings, which could be,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.320]   I mean, it could be anything.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.760]   It could be, you've got a part-time job,
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.600]   you're renting a house out and you're a landlord.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.760]   So this is your rent.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.720]   You can also make this a one-time thing.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.200]   So imagine you're gonna sell your house.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.000]   You can uncheck this recurring box,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.600]   which will sort of gray out the end year.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.200]   And this particular adjustment will only happen on 2030.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.960]   So these things, these kinds of things are pretty useful.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:30.160]   Some of the inputs in here might look familiar.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.760]   You know, amount per year, that's pretty simple.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.080]   This label here, you know,
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.400]   I find this useful mostly because there's an ability
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   to come back to your simulations later.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.000]   So real quick, I'm just gonna run this
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.640]   and sort of ignore the output
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.040]   because I can click this link
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.920]   and it will reload the exact same things,
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.880]   exact same inputs that you entered before.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.320]   I'll talk a little bit more about that
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.640]   when I'm on the output page.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.680]   I apologize for jumping back and forth.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.360]   So this label is important.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.400]   This is also important.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.600]   Some people have been known to mess up
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.840]   and put the wrong thing in here
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.160]   where they meant spending and they put savings.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.280]   And they're like, why do I have so much money at retirement?
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.720]   It's like, well, you said your kid's college
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.800]   was actually a savings or income stream
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.600]   instead of a spending stream.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.840]   So that's an interesting thing
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   that you need to look out for.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.520]   One sort of option in here
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.440]   that might be a little different for you
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.000]   is this value here.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.600]   I wasn't really aware,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.840]   this is where the crowdsourcing comes in.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.080]   I wasn't really aware of this
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.560]   because I don't have a government pension.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.160]   I know that there are other,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.960]   my wife has a, she has a private pension.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.600]   And actually, I think this applies to it,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.480]   but I don't pay much attention to her pension and stuff.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   But this little checkbox essentially is for pensions.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:22.000]   So a lot of pensions will have this setup
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.240]   where they'll tell you,
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.600]   hey, you're gonna get $5,000 a year
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.560]   once you start collecting your pension.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.160]   That value is often frozen
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.920]   and it's always gonna be $5,000
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.960]   until you start collecting.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.520]   And then only after that
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.200]   will it be adjusted for inflation.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.240]   So if you have a pension that's like that,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.520]   you'll wanna click this button
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.280]   and have this clicked, inflation adjusted,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.240]   and it will stay at $5,000
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.640]   until you start collecting it.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.040]   Now, that may seem intuitive,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.360]   but anything on here
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.920]   that you select inflation adjusted for
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.440]   that's in the future, for instance.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.160]   So I just unchecked this
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.960]   and this is nine years in the future.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.600]   What's gonna happen is
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.200]   even though you're not taking this pension until 2030,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.120]   this adjusts that value for inflation every single year.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.760]   So nine years down the road,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.800]   this might suddenly be $7,000.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.720]   That wouldn't normally be a problem for a lot of things,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.680]   but like I said,
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.040]   pensions have this knack for being frozen in time
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.440]   until you start actually taking them.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.560]   So this is a worthwhile thing.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.280]   I forgot to mention at the very beginning of this,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.320]   some of the things at the top of my site.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.480]   Fairly recently, I've started writing tutorials
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.760]   that sort of describe some of this functionality.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   So if you miss something on here
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.120]   and you don't wanna go back through the video,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.960]   you can certainly check out this tutorial section.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.120]   I'm gonna click here real quick.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.240]   Right now, I sort of only have information
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.040]   about the basic section and what the output looks like,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.800]   but I definitely have,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.080]   I've already written articles for spending plans.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.520]   I just haven't gotten them up yet.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.640]   And I definitely am gonna talk more
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.480]   about some of these things.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.840]   I'm gonna quickly scan over essentially the information
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.000]   that I'm gonna put in this demo.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.400]   So hopefully that's helpful.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.360]   And go back here.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.560]   Okay, so adjustments.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.040]   Recurrent, the recurrence button, I sort of mentioned.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.880]   Does this occur over a span of years or is it just once?
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.800]   And then whether or not this is inflation adjusted or not
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   is pretty straightforward.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.160]   Just like above, you can choose the inflation type.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.800]   It can either be the historical CPI
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.920]   or it can be a flat rate.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.320]   I actually know that a lot of pensions
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.160]   have a flat rate adjustment, so that can be pretty useful.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.880]   And let's see.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.440]   I believe that that is essentially
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:35.520]   a quick scan through of all available inputs
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.800]   without touching spending plan.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.720]   So spending plan has lots of different things
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.440]   that show up after you click the appropriate spending plan.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.480]   And I'm gonna go over that in just a moment.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.040]   Firstly, though, I'm going to refresh this page,
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.560]   have the default scenario,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.320]   and we're gonna talk about the output page.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.240]   So this is a pretty standard situation.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.640]   In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the exact same inputs
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.280]   that FireCalc does.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.720]   This is a 30-year scenario.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.680]   It may look like it's 29 years,
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   but it counts this year and this if you, it's 30 years.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.760]   With a million dollars and $40,000 spending per year,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.480]   this is the classic 4% rule.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   I'm gonna hit Enter or hit this button up here.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   And this lovely rainbow graph is what you would see
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.040]   when you hit Run Simulation.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.160]   There's a lot going on on this page.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.000]   I've tried really hard on this site
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.320]   to put as much information out there as I can
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.080]   without making it too confusing.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.240]   However, I do understand that because I'm the one
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.360]   who wrote this, I know where everything is,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.200]   and it might look a little wild
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.280]   to someone who hasn't checked it out.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.640]   So I'm gonna go over a couple of the sections here.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.840]   So the first thing you're gonna see
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.920]   is this really big, wild rainbow graph.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:15.600]   So what this is is essentially every single simulation
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.720]   of 30-year span over the course of history, starting in 1871.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.560]   And what I mean by that is, let me see if I can,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:30.680]   I think I wrote a pretty nice graphic of this.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.840]   Oh, no, I got rid of the graph.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.680]   Oh, wait.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.560]   Output tab.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.640]   No, I got rid of the graphic.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.480]   That's a bummer.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:47.600]   So what you have to imagine is this data goes back to 1871.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   So it's gonna take your inputs and it's gonna go to 1871
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.560]   and put them in as a theoretical million dollars
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.600]   and a theoretical $40,000 spending.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.680]   And it's gonna run the data from 1871 to 1901.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.720]   And it's gonna see how your portfolio would have done.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.240]   Then it's gonna start a new simulation in 1872
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.640]   and go to 1902 and so on and so forth
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.040]   until you get all the way to the 2020 data,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   which if I try real hard, I can find it in here.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:28.200]   But this results in sort of this cool graph
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.120]   and you can kind of get a sense of what's going on here.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.120]   There are periods of, if you hover over this,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   it sort of hovers on an entire simulation.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.560]   So right here, it's kind of hard to see in the blues,
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.480]   but that blue line dips down really far.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.600]   This was not a good period in time.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.280]   In fact, this is the classic beginning
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.440]   of the stagflation period in the late '60s and early '70s.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.120]   So what this represents is your portfolio over time.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.560]   Now, like I mentioned before, this is today's dollars.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   So it's adjusted to make it easier on your brain
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.680]   to figure out what this is worth.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.440]   So if you started with a million dollars,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.240]   this is worth roughly six times as much.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.960]   However, in nominal dollars, this is probably way more.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.000]   I'm just gonna make a speculative guess
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and say this is like $11 million, double that or more
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.600]   in nominal dollars.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.880]   Now, how do you figure that out?
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.200]   You could go into the CSV up here.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.800]   I guess I will open this up.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   This is sort of stream of consciousness.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.600]   So if you click on this button,
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.200]   you're gonna get this long named CSV file.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.280]   I don't even have Word on here.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.880]   I don't even have Excel on here.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.040]   Where'd my screen go?
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:10.840]   All right, it's gonna load it up.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:17.520]   And this is not gonna be very easy to show people,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.800]   but this is a very long file
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:27.680]   and it has every year of every 30 year period
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.000]   in this simulation.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.760]   So if you go to the top, it says the cycle start year
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.720]   is 1871.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   So this is the 30 years starting in 1871
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   and it has your starting portfolio
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.280]   and has the inflation adjusted portfolio
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.080]   as the spending and the inflation adjusted spending.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.120]   So for this particular one,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.280]   which is the one I think I was highlighting,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   if we look at the ending portfolio,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.440]   and this is just a quick tangent,
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.040]   ending portfolio right here,
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.440]   what was the ending portfolio of this one?
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:14.960]   3.2 million and the inflation adjusted was higher.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.800]   Gotcha.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.880]   Anyway, this is a bit of a tangent,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.400]   but good to know that you can look at all the numbers there.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.720]   This here is a big ugly link
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.320]   that will allow you to get back to your same inputs.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:41.240]   A lot of people ask me why I don't have a login system
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.960]   so that you can save your data.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.160]   I have taken a hard stance on that
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.400]   because I don't want to deal with
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.480]   keeping the data anonymized, to be honest.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.120]   Right now, as it stands,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.600]   I have a database full of people's inputs.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.560]   I have no idea who put them in and I'm okay with that.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.520]   I'm not in the business of selling data.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.160]   I don't make any money from this site.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.720]   This is a 100% passion project
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.080]   and I want to keep it that way.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.960]   So I anonymize the data and I put it into here as a link
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.920]   so you can get back to it rather than have a login system
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.080]   that's tied to your email.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.800]   Maybe that makes you feel good.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.880]   Maybe that makes you feel like this tool is clunky.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.360]   Okay, back to this chart.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.800]   Real quick, as I'm scrolling through here,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.160]   if you look below down here,
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.440]   I can't point to it while being on the screen,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.640]   but if you look below, it says that the year is 1953,
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.000]   the cycle start year of this particular simulation was 1935.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.160]   And at this point in time, the portfolio is 1.3 million.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.560]   So as you go through here,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.560]   you can kind of get a good idea of what happened in history.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.040]   Very similar to this chart is right next to it,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.720]   the inflation adjusted spending over all the simulations.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.120]   Now, a lot of people get confused when they first see this
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.560]   and they say, why is it a flat line?
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   Well, because you chose $40,000 as a spending point
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.040]   and because you chose it to be
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.360]   just straight up inflation adjusted,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   it's $40,000 every single year.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.440]   And it sees that there, you see it there.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.480]   If we choose other spending plans, which are variable,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.080]   which we will go over in a bit,
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.720]   they definitely go wild over here.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.440]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.320]   Okay, there are a lot of numbers here
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.840]   and without getting too verbose,
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.040]   I'm gonna talk about the most important ones
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.080]   and then let you sort of figure it out after that.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.480]   I think the most important thing is this little section here
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.800]   right below the portfolio chart.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.240]   This is the success rate.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.920]   Success on this tool is defined
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.200]   as you still having any money in your portfolio
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.160]   when the simulation is over or when you're gone.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.080]   You can have $1 in your account and it will be a success.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.880]   If you look on this chart, there are a couple of these.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.840]   This is the very last year of this portfolio.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.080]   It started off with a million dollars, it's down to 50,000,
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.000]   but that person made it to the end.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.840]   That's a success.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   So out of a possible 121 different 30,000,
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.400]   30 year periods in history,
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.120]   this particular setup would have only failed five times.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.520]   This is essentially the definition of the 4% rule
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.480]   that is often cited.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   The 4% rule is not 100% successful, it's 95% successful,
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.920]   which for most people is good enough.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yeah, I'm not gonna tell you what success rate
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   is desirable.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.720]   You can look and read a lot about that topic.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.120]   One of the recent papers
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   that sort of has blown my mind recently
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.080]   is Michael Kites, a financial planner,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.280]   has written a paper that essentially says
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.320]   that if you do a Monte Carlo simulation,
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.840]   which is different than this,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.920]   this isn't just historical data.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.600]   If you do a Monte Carlo simulation,
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.200]   which is randomized data,
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:50.280]   and you have a 50% success rate for retiring,
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.040]   that if you did that every single year, you'd be fine,
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.400]   as long as it was 50% every single year.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.240]   Now, do I feel comfortable with 50%?
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.160]   Probably not, but that's up to you to decide.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.800]   Some people need this to be 100%.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.120]   It's totally however your brain works.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.880]   This number here is sort of what your portfolio was
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.400]   at retirement for this particular scenario.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.480]   Because I retired right now on the scenario,
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.360]   it's just exactly what you put in
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.040]   as an input for your portfolio.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.520]   Beyond that, this entire side, the left side,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.160]   is all talking about portfolios.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.320]   This entire right side is talking about your spending.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.240]   I have all sorts of statistical numbers in here.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.120]   I've got the average ending portfolio.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.560]   I've got the average yearly withdrawals.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.040]   I've got the average total withdrawals.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.880]   I've got the median, the standard deviation,
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.640]   which is sort of the volatility.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.320]   I've got the highest value, the lowest.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.120]   And then by popular demand, I put in the lowest 10%,
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.200]   and the lowest 5%, just to see sort of
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.880]   what the slices of the statistical pie
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.160]   are here for these particular simulations.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.920]   You'll sort of notice that a lot of these numbers
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.760]   are the same.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.000]   That's not a bug.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.480]   When you have very flat data, it tends to end up like that.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   Like I said before, the spending is $40,000 flat every year,
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.920]   inflation adjusted.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.400]   So these numbers are all gonna be the same,
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.840]   just like over here.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.040]   I'm not gonna go over this entire chart for spending,
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.040]   but I will say that I've split it up into quarters
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.280]   and the first five years.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.040]   These are sort of very,
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.240]   these are both statistics that are very often cited
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.920]   in sort of financial planning articles,
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.040]   or people even on the Bogleheads forums will say,
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   the first five years is the most dangerous part
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:09.880]   of retiring.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:15.280]   So I've included sort of statistics on spending
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   for these different time periods.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   Now, someone asked me recently, like,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.000]   do these quarters mean only the retirement period?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.320]   And the answer is yes.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.880]   If I wrote that I was retiring in 2031,
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.600]   so 10 years of pre-retirement simulation,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.960]   this information would only be including
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.120]   the retirement period.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.480]   I'll let you look at some of these later.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.080]   I don't wanna get too verbose on this page.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.160]   The last thing I'll talk about is this.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.080]   I kind of hide this a little bit because it's long
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.400]   and most people don't wanna see it,
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.040]   but if you click this show button,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.880]   it brings up a extra chart.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.280]   Now, these are the single years
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.840]   where the portfolio was the lowest
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   out of all the simulations.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.040]   It tells you what the portfolio was.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.360]   Now, if you look, five of these failed.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.920]   So of course we have five zeros,
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.800]   but look at this guy.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.360]   I didn't see it before,
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.720]   but in a starting year of 1967,
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.320]   in year 28, it got down to $4,000.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.360]   Actually, this makes sense because right here,
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.680]   starting year of 1967, the very next year, it goes to zero.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.240]   These are just individual data points.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.000]   People like to see how low it goes before failure.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.240]   If you happen to have a simulation that has 100% success,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.920]   it's still interesting to look
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.040]   at how low it has gone in the past.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.800]   So keep this little section in mind
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.560]   if you're the kind of person that likes to look
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.600]   at the very edge cases of things.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.600]   I don't usually look at this very often,
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.440]   but to each their own.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:14.560]   Okay, I've gone over this.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.800]   Another basic functionality to note is if you look up here,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.280]   I have these two little tabs.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.680]   When you submit the form, it doesn't refresh the page.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.720]   It opens a little tab here and puts the information here.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.280]   If I click back onto the Inputs tab,
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.760]   I see my same inputs that I had before.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.080]   This is just the regular default data.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   Now, what you can do is you can do things like this.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.680]   The retirement end year is 2050 in this case.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.640]   Well, what if it was 2055?
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.200]   I'm gonna leave everything the same,
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.560]   but what if it was a longer period of time?
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.080]   What if I think I'm gonna live till I'm 95?
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.160]   If you notice up at the top here,
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.000]   it loaded a new tab called Sim 2.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.600]   This shows the statistics for what I just put in.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.800]   It failed another extra couple of times
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.640]   because it's trying to eke out
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.080]   another five years of retirement.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.760]   But most importantly, what I wanted to show you
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.000]   is that you can click between these tabs
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.680]   and essentially have a bunch
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.240]   of different simulations out at once.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.080]   Whichever tab you were last on,
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.840]   when you click on the Inputs tab,
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.320]   it will load the inputs for that simulation.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.880]   It will tell you that it loaded it.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.440]   And if you look, this is the input
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.600]   that I used for Sim Tab 2.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   If I go back to one and then go back to the inputs,
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.240]   it will load it from Sim Tab 1, which was 2050.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.760]   It does that for everything on this page.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.480]   So it's kind of useful if you're sort of iterating through
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.000]   and trying to find a very specific time
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   that how many years you can retire or things like that.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.200]   So this is a very useful feature.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.520]   I personally like it.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.680]   You can also hit this little red X,
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.600]   which I hope is intuitive, and it will make it go away.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:18.960]   Let's see.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.000]   One last thing.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.400]   I guess I missed this.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   So I haven't gotten to do a lot of these yet,
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.280]   but if you click this button, Open Investigation Options,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.520]   it opens this little extra spot down here.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.000]   Once upon a time,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.480]   this was a very popular thing on the site.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.040]   And I can't remember if FireCalc does something similar,
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.520]   but essentially what this does,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.920]   if you click this little slide thing,
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:03.160]   it's gonna look for the maximum initial yearly spending
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.640]   for this amount of success.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.960]   This is actually a typo.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.520]   I should just delete this
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.720]   and just say for this amount of success.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.960]   So if you type in 95 here,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   it's gonna run the simulation many times
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.280]   to figure out what is the maximum number of spending here
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.960]   to get 95% success.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.120]   Oh, I unchecked it right before I hit Enter.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:32.960]   Let's go back.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:39.400]   This one takes a little bit longer
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.920]   'cause it actually runs multiple scenarios in a row.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.040]   So I would not worry too much about it spinning.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.120]   Okay, this looks a lot like the other simulations,
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.080]   but down here, I sort of write this little note
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.800]   just says investigation was complete.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.200]   Then it tells you the maximum initial spending
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.120]   is $40,507 exactly.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:10.280]   And it results in 9,504.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.680]   I would say that this is accurate within $10 usually.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.920]   Just the way that I'm iterating through the thing,
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.000]   it makes it really inefficient to find it down to the $1.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.920]   I'd rather it spit out something very close.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:31.880]   So if you were to put this amount back in the Inputs tab,
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:37.320]   it would give you the same,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.640]   it should give you the same amount of success.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.600]   Boom, 9,504, perfect.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.280]   Really hoping I can make it through this demo
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.920]   without displaying a bug in real time.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:53.880]   Okay.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.600]   All right.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:04.280]   I've gone over most of the basic stuff.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.240]   The spending plans I've yet to go over,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.840]   Jim or whoever else, Keith,
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.200]   I don't know if we wanna take any questions now.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.520]   - All right, we're recording.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.360]   - All right.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.840]   Spending plans.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.000]   Spending plans are my favorite part of this tool.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.400]   Honestly, this is the thing that I mess with the most
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.920]   in terms of my own personal situation.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.840]   And I think that it's a pretty undervalued thing.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.240]   I am not a, I'm gonna say this a lot.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.760]   I work for a financial firm
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.680]   and I am not, this is not part of their work.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.200]   And I know all the legal disclaimers.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.680]   I am not a financial planner.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   However, I know that people do not spend
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.880]   the exact amount of money
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.160]   or same amount of money every year.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.360]   And modeling that is kind of unrealistic.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.840]   Ideally, people are vacillating between
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.760]   a spending high and a spending low,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.440]   and they know roughly what their average spending is.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:17.840]   We can do that with these different variable spending plans.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.320]   VPW was just asked about in the question and answer section.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.120]   So I'm gonna go over that one first.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.960]   So VPW is a,
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:35.680]   essentially a spending plan or a variable spending plan.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.120]   Or a withdrawal plan, if you will,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:38.960]   that was come up,
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.080]   that came up with on the Bogleheads forums.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:47.280]   I can't remember the username off the top of my head.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.120]   I want to say, was it long invest?
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.520]   Anyway, one of the users came up with this
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.960]   and the premise of this is pretty simple.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.160]   Well, the premise is simple,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.960]   but the calculations are complicated.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.600]   The premise is that this user would look at
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.440]   sort of the standard inflation adjusted simulations.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.760]   And they would see that a person who had a million dollars
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.640]   and spent roughly 40,000 a year
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.120]   would end up with a portfolio of $6 million at the end.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.440]   And they thought, you know what?
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.120]   You can't take it with you.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.720]   I wanna spend all the money.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.320]   How can I do that in a safe way?
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.720]   And the models, basically, if you look here,
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.160]   if you go back to inflation adjusted,
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.560]   you can't just say, I'm gonna spend 60,000 a year.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.360]   I gotta back this up.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.600]   You can't just say, I'm gonna spend 60,000 a year
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.400]   because if you spend a flat 60,000 a year, it fails a ton.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.840]   And it's just not sustainable, you can't do that.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.520]   So he wanted to find a safer way
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.520]   to get as close to zero at the end of life as possible.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.320]   What he did was take a combination
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   of sort of writing his own annuity each year
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:20.360]   based on the end point of your simulation.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.120]   Excuse me, talking too much.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.760]   So he wrote out a sort of annuity formula
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   and then based it on whatever future value you wanted.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.960]   So these two values are new values when you select VPW.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.040]   And this is sort of a rate of return
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:50.640]   that the aforementioned annuity is based on.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.720]   And this future value is essentially
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.040]   what you want your portfolio to be at the very end.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:02.920]   Now, this number is largely ignored in the VPW.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   I believe it has some significance to the starting point
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   but it very quickly gets changed along the way.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.560]   So just in case I changed some other things,
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.400]   I'm gonna refresh this real quick to the defaults
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.000]   then I'm gonna switch it to VPW.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.920]   And then this is the default stuff.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.720]   I'm just gonna run the simulation and see what happens.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:35.080]   So you'll see that it says 100% success.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:40.080]   Now that means that the portfolios were above zero
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.560]   when the person died.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.880]   Now, if you look at this chart on the left,
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.280]   it looks a lot different than the other ones.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.400]   If you look, everything is spiraling down to zero
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.560]   but it falls just short.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.800]   So the math behind this allows you to spend it down
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.760]   so that you essentially end up with less money
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.160]   at the end of retirement.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.880]   Now, if you look on the right here,
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.840]   this is the first time you've seen the spending graph
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.640]   become a variable graph.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.080]   Now, if you look here, this might be sort of unfathomable.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.720]   This is a million dollar portfolio.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.440]   And at some point spending is getting to be
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.800]   like $200,000 in a year.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.400]   How can that be?
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   Well, I mean, it follows the market sort of gains
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.200]   for a given year.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.120]   And every single year it's calculating
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.200]   based on the current portfolio
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.600]   and how many years you have left to live
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.440]   and the expected return rate,
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.760]   what it thinks you're gonna have at the end.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.680]   So it keeps increasing that.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.120]   Well, it really just varies it up and down.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.440]   But so if you look here, it goes up and down quite a bit.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.280]   But if you see here,
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.160]   if you look at the average spending
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.800]   for this entire simulation,
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.480]   it is quite a bit above 4%.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.720]   But if you look on the left side of this chart,
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.880]   the average ending portfolio is 85,000.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.720]   This is as close to zero as we can get
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.800]   without failing before your end of life.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:26.440]   So this is an interesting example of something crowdsourced.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.600]   Someone on the Bogleheads forum
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.640]   was writing the sort of thesis for this
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.840]   and you can find it out there.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:37.680]   It's still a very, I think it's a very trafficked thread.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:42.640]   But that person came to me in like 2015 or 2014
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.360]   and asked if I can make this happen
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.320]   as part of the website and I did.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.840]   So it's kind of an interesting way of thinking
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.480]   about spending if you're willing to spend it all down.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.880]   And before I move on to the next one,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.520]   one thing to note is you can change the future value.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.760]   If you're planning on spending more than normal,
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.640]   but you want more than just zero left at the end,
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.280]   maybe you wanna leave 200,000 to your kids or something,
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.120]   you can change this future value
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.200]   and it tries real hard to make things happen at 200,000.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.640]   Actually, it seems to not have done that.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.400]   I told you I was trying to make it
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.160]   through the entire video without a bug, but here we go.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:36.680]   I'll have to check that out.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.240]   So if you look, some of these portfolios,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.320]   they actually dip down to zero.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.440]   It looks like they're failing right before the end.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.560]   So that's interesting.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.840]   Anyway, we'll move on to the next one.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.080]   All right.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.760]   So when you have inflation adjusted,
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   of course, this is the not inflation adjusted scenario.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.720]   Essentially, it takes your spending and never changes it.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   That means over time, your actual value of your money
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.440]   is gonna go down because inflation's gonna be
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.760]   sort of reducing the value of it.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.360]   So if you run this really quick,
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.680]   you'll see on the right side here
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.320]   that inflation really changes things.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.960]   Now, what's interesting here is in the early 1800s,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.880]   there's quite a bit of deflation.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.800]   So even though you're not adjusting your spending here,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:40.560]   your inflation adjusted value of that spending
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.360]   is going up.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.640]   But the vast majority of sort of modern times,
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.520]   the value of that money is going down quite a bit.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.200]   If you look at sort of the averages here,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.520]   really you're averaging 30,
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.600]   you're averaging lower than 40,000 per year
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.960]   if you never adjust it.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:04.400]   And I don't know if anyone's,
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.960]   I can't remember from our poll
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.520]   who frequents earlyretirement.org,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.120]   but it's a common trope on early retirement
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.160]   that you don't wanna be eating cat food in retirement.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:21.040]   So if your spending reduces to half of what it started,
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.280]   you might be in trouble.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.440]   Okay, I'm gonna go back.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.080]   What's next?
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.720]   Percent of portfolio.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:37.000]   Okay, this is a pretty simple one on its surface,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.840]   but there's some nuances that a lot of people miss.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:46.360]   So percent of portfolio pops up one new field
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.200]   called the yearly spending,
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.960]   which is a percentage of the portfolio for that given year.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:56.640]   So when we talk about the 4% rule,
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.280]   if you're not familiar, which I hope you are if you're here,
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.320]   but if you're not familiar for people out there,
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.400]   the 4% rule is based on a study
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:09.400]   where they had portfolios of people at retirement
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:16.000]   and starting at retirement,
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   their starting spending was 4% of that portfolio value.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.800]   Then from then on out, no matter what the portfolio did,
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   you just only adjusted your spending for inflation.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.960]   So every year wasn't 4%.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.560]   It was just the very beginning.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.280]   This particular spending plan, percent of portfolio,
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.000]   every single year, it's going to take your portfolio value
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.760]   and then adjust your spending based on that.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.720]   If you start off with a million dollar portfolio
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.880]   and somehow it gets to be $2 million,
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.320]   well, 4% of $2 million is $80,000.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.240]   And that's what it's gonna set your spending to.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.920]   So if you run this, you'll see on the right,
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.480]   that the spending is wildly varied.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.360]   If you would have retired in the '80s,
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.400]   your spending would have gotten up to $157,000
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.600]   by using this method.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:20.040]   Now, this says here that it's 100% success rate.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.240]   Now that is true.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.840]   And that is true because no matter how high
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.520]   or how low your portfolio gets,
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.320]   it's gonna only take out 4%.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.880]   So if you look here, the spending in this year
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.200]   was only $15,000.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.680]   That's because the portfolio dropped quite a bit.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.640]   By definition, if you're only ever taking 4%
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.520]   of the portfolio, it's almost never gonna go to zero.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.160]   So how do we simulate these on a more realistic manner?
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.880]   If we go back here, I'm gonna introduce this other section
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.840]   of the variable spending that is very important.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   It's a concept of a spending floor and a spending ceiling.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.720]   So, well, I'm gonna go back to the tab real quick.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   If we look here, we're trying to spend 4% of our portfolio.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.800]   Now, if you're trying to stay within the realm
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.320]   of $40,000 inflation-adjusted spending,
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.040]   you look at this chart and you say, wow, it's really,
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.480]   I mean, it doubles or triples sometimes,
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.600]   and it goes down to the major, I'm eating cat food level.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.880]   How do we fight against that?
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.320]   We do that with spending floors and spending ceilings.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.160]   So the idea of a spending floor,
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.800]   and I'm gonna choose a defined spending floor value,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.240]   is that the simulation will never allow the spending
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.600]   to go below the floor.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.360]   So in this case, this is a 4% rule.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.960]   I personally like to think like, hey,
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:05.960]   I can take a 10% haircut on my spending and be okay.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.280]   So I'm gonna put the floor to be $36,000.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.440]   Now, if we just run this as is without doing the ceiling,
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.240]   if you look on the right,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.640]   you'll see some very distinct flat bottoms.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.200]   It never goes below the $36,000 that we set,
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.440]   and that's great.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.160]   However, it also goes out of control in these other places.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.880]   Now, maybe you want it to go out of control.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.800]   Maybe you wanna set a floor,
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   and when your portfolio goes crazy, you can go crazy too.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.160]   That's great.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.240]   Some people are trying to pay more attention
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.480]   to their average ending portfolio
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.800]   to make sure that they can pass money along
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.080]   for some sort of generational wealth.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.800]   So if we go back to the inputs again,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.720]   what we can do is we can rein in the spending
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.640]   by setting a ceiling.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.200]   Now, like the floor, you might've guessed,
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.160]   the ceiling makes it so the spending
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.720]   will never go above a certain amount.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.360]   So let's say we have a $40,000 target.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.600]   Let's go crazy and say, if in good years,
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.680]   we can spend up to $60,000, that'd be great.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.280]   And we're gonna run that.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.920]   Now, this might look a little wilder
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.680]   'cause this is sort of to scale.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.440]   So when the values went up to 157,000,
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.040]   they looked a lot more squished,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:41.080]   but now they're within 24,000 of each other.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.560]   So if you look, there's some very distinct flat tops
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.400]   and flat bottoms.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.480]   It's bouncing around in between the spending floor
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.760]   and the spending ceiling.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.880]   I love this feature.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.240]   I think that it's one of the more realistic things
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.400]   that happens in retirement.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.320]   Most people will have sort of this idea in their head
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.960]   of what they wanna spend,
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.200]   and they'll have like a sort of belt tightening amount
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.360]   in their head that they don't wanna go below.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.720]   And then on good years, maybe they'll spend more.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.920]   This allows you to do that.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.520]   I really like this feature.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.760]   So that's what that looks like.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.960]   One of the things you can do is set the floor
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.080]   to be the value of your adjustments.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.720]   So if your retirement is dependent
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.800]   on a lot of social security and pensions,
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.640]   and say this person has $30,000 worth of pensions
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.960]   and social security, if you can set the floor to be that,
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   then it's a quick and easy way to deal with the floor.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.440]   I don't have that same ability for the ceiling
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.600]   'cause I think it's kind of silly to be able to select
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.040]   your adjustments as the ceiling,
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.960]   but maybe someone can convince me otherwise.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.680]   But they're of percent value.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.280]   Wow, it's 9.30 Eastern already.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.740]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.480]   (upbeat music)
