[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   So one of the nice things, actually, about studying these kinds of things, like basic
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.860]   mechanisms of hunger, thirst, because these things are so important for survival, they've
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.800]   been under really strong selection, right? And so many of the components of these systems
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.640]   are genetically hardwired, meaning these are cell types that have a single purpose, in
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.440]   this case, to control hunger. They're labeled by specific genes, and those are conserved
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.480]   through evolution. We also know that this pathway, this AGR-PNRM pathway, is important
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.520]   in humans due to human genetics. So just to add a little bit more information here, there's
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.680]   a companion set of neurons called POMC neurons that promote satiety. So they're sort of the
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   yin and yang of hunger. AGRP neurons promote hunger, POMC neurons promote satiety. They're
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.600]   intermingled in the same part of the hypothalamus. They're axons that project to the exact same
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.440]   downstream brain regions, and it's thought that these two neurons compete with each other
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.280]   to control appetite. And that competition occurs through neuropeptides that they release,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   one of which is an agonist for a downstream receptor, and the other one of which is an
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   antagonist. We know from human genetics that among severely obese people, mutations in
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.040]   this pathway, AGRP, POMC neurons, and their direct downstream targets, are quite common.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:30.080]   So is it fair to say that some amount of obesity is genetic in nature at the level of neuronal
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.420]   firing or circuitry?
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.200]   I think a lot of body weight regulation is genetic. It's highly heritable. There's a
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.880]   question of how much of it is due to single genes. And the number of people, quote, and
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.160]   this is among people who are severely obese, so not just people who you've seen someone
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.560]   who's overweight, but people have sort of syndromes where they're very obese from a
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.000]   very young age, among those people, something on the order of 10% have mutations in this
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.600]   pathway. And it can either be this hormone POMC, or an enzyme within those cells that
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.480]   processes POMC into the right form, or, and this is the most common mutation, in the downstream
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.320]   receptor for POMC, it's called the melanocortin-4 receptor. And so among the severely obese,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.040]   people who have sort of genetically inherited severe obesity from childhood, something on
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.600]   the order of 10% have mutations in this pathway. So it's very clear that this pathway is involved
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.960]   in body weight regulation in humans. Most obesity, although there is a very strong genetic
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.520]   component, is not associated with single gene mutations like this. It's associated with
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.800]   effects of many mutations. But we know that even in that sort of polygenic obesity that
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.720]   has many different genetic causes, that the brain is important. And one of the reasons
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440]   we know that is if you look at the genes through genetic association studies that have been
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   associated with body weight, and there's been lots of genetic association studies trying
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.760]   to find mutations that are associated with whether you're lean or obese, something on
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.280]   the order of 1,000 genes have been linked to body weight regulation. And the vast majority
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   of those are expressed in the brain. They're highly enriched for brain processes, which
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.560]   makes sense because body weight is controlled by food intake, right? And the brain controls
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.720]   behavior and also the brain controls energy expenditure. So maybe it's not so surprising,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.680]   but it's clear that mutations in genes in the brain are important for body weight, and
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.400]   which is consistent with the results of twin studies. So if you look at monozygotic versus
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.200]   dizygotic twins, the estimates for the heritability of body weight is something on the order of
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.360]   80%.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.040]   We should explain monozygotic, dizygotic, which I've talked about before on the podcast,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   to people.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.000]   Sure, just identical versus fraternal twins, basically. And by comparing their, basically,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.800]   their body weight when they become adults, you can get a sense for how much of this is
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.840]   genetic versus environmental. And something on the order of 80% is thought to, the variation
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.040]   between individuals is thought to have a genetic component.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.080]   Wow. I don't think most people appreciate that. And a lot of the debate we hear nowadays
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.840]   is because there are things that people can do to lose body fat, exercise, eat differently,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:16.120]   et cetera, maybe embrace pharmacology if that's appropriate. There seems to be this, to me,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.280]   silly debate as to whether or not people should be eating better and exercising or assuming
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.640]   that all of the obesity they might have arises through genetic causes and therefore take
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.920]   a prescription drug. I mean, why wouldn't it be a combination of things? To me, it just
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.040]   seems like, why wouldn't people embrace some or all of the tools that they could afford
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800]   and that are safe for them? So, I just want to get that out there because the moment this
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.640]   comes up, people start thinking, "Oh, well, the moment we assign a genetic source to something,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.720]   we're removing personal responsibility." But of course, there are people, I know people
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.840]   who have struggled with their weight their entire lives, for whom some of these new pharmaceuticals
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.960]   like Ozempic have provided them the opportunity to finally be able to lose weight and feel
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.120]   better and exercise safely, for instance.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.000]   - I completely agree with that. I think there is a misconception out there about this, about
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.920]   what it means for something to be genetically heritable. And I think this gets to the root
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.120]   of why so many people find this sort of hard to believe that there's such a strong genetic
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.280]   component to body weight. And that's the idea that if you look at people, say, 75 years
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.400]   ago, they were much leaner. And you look at people today and there's been this, starting
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.640]   sometime around, you know, the 1970s, there was this explosion in body weight and increase
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.640]   in obesity.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.200]   - Is that when, that's when it started, mid-seventies?
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.720]   - Sort of the 1970s is when a lot of that started happening.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   - Snack food, snacking.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   - So, there's lots of explanations.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.960]   - Seed oil snacking. By the way, I don't think that's the reason, folks. I think there are
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.020]   a lot of reasons, but the theories that abound right now on social media are, I have a list
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.720]   of theories as to why the obesity is increasing. You get everything from seed oils to snacking
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:01.000]   to smartphones to conspiracies to, it's wild. It's wild. The range of hypotheses is wild.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.400]   - Yeah, I mean, and the challenges, I mean, some of them could be true, but it's just
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.000]   very hard to test those things experimentally because they're happening in the whole population,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   right? But, so I think the thing that people find hard to wrap their heads around, because
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.560]   it is a little bit of a confusing idea, is that how can it be that in say 50 or 75 years,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.600]   there's been this explosion in obesity, which is, the environment has changed, but human
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.080]   genetics has not changed in that amount of time. It's just not fast enough for people
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.560]   to evolve. So, it can't be due to mutations in humans.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.920]   - What about devolve? My understanding is that within a species, evolving new traits
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.320]   is very slow, but mutations arise, like the OB mutation, and then you can get very fat
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:44.600]   versions of an animal very quickly, right? All you need is a, if it's a recessive allele,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.380]   you need two copies, and the next thing you know, you've got a mouse that's four times
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.540]   larger than a typical mouse, and it's all explained by increased body weight. So, that
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.880]   can happen very quickly within a species. What's rare to find is an entire new branch
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.840]   of a species that has a very, a new adaptive function. That seems more rare.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.520]   - So, that's true. So, definitely there's some things that take longer to evolve than
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.040]   others, but with humans, we're talking about just two generations. There just isn't enough
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.180]   time for any evolution of any significance to happen.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.160]   - Baby boomers, right? General Dex, that's new, right? And then whatever is YZ millennial.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   - Exactly.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   - Like I lose track after that.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.700]   - Exactly. So, I think the thing that people find hard to wrap their heads around is how
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.000]   can it be that this is, that increase in body weight is clearly environmental, right? Because
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.540]   that's all that's changed is the environment. Nothing's changed genetically. Yet, it's also
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.440]   true what I said, that body weight is extremely heritable. It's one of the most heritable
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.720]   features and something on the order of 80%. The only thing, one of the only things we
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.240]   know about that's actually more heritable than body weight is height, right? Most diseases
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.360]   are not as heritable as body weight. How can you explain that? And the idea is this, there's
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.260]   a distribution of body weights among people. So, in any given society at any point in time,
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.920]   some people are going to be leaner, some people are going to be more obese. That distribution,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.880]   where you lie on that distribution, is determined primarily by genetics. So, you may be the
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.360]   person who has the thrifty genes, so that basically cause you to save energy, and so
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.680]   you would be more on the obese side. Or you may be a person who has different genes that
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.160]   cause you to be a little bit less hungry, so you would be on the leaner side. What environment
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.640]   does is then it shifts that whole distribution, so that basically the mean shifts so that
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.320]   everyone becomes, or most people become heavier. And so, sort of a phrase that people sometimes
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   use is that genetics loads the gun and environment pulls the trigger. So, basically genetics
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.740]   sets your propensity, and then environment can basically unmask that. And so, as we've
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.000]   had this change in environment where there's all of this, and we don't know exactly what
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.920]   the things are that have changed that are important, but there's all this ultra-processed
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.620]   food, highly palatable food, just various other things that you mentioned, seed oils,
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:55.000]   who knows if that's important. Certain people had these latent mutations that made them,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.840]   say, very sensitive to palatable food. And in an earlier time, they may have been lean,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.160]   but now because they have that latent capacity to be sensitive to ultra-processed food, they
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.000]   now gain tons of weight in the environment that we're in. It's still because of genetics,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.400]   but it also requires the environmental component. I mean, you just take a step back, right?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.760]   You can make anyone lean by just putting them in prison and just only feeding them 1,500
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.440]   calories. I mean, we've done those kinds of experiments. There's this famous experiment,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.880]   the Minnesota starvation experiment, right? They basically put people in prison, but this
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.640]   is in World War II. They took a bunch of healthy volunteers, fed them 1,600 calories a day,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.080]   and just asked what would happen if you basically semi-starved people. And unsurprisingly, they
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   lose an incredible amount of weight. All they think about is food. Basically, their body
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.520]   temperature goes down. Their heart rate goes down. They just become obsessed with food.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.560]   And you could always do that for anyone, right? But in a given environment where you're not
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.800]   in that kind of situation, then your propensity to gain weight will be determined by genetics.
