[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.880]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue after a little hiatus. Remember, our email is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.000]   Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Innovator ETFs. So, Innovator has these defined outcome
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.680]   ETFs, Duncan, right? Now, they can be a little tricky to understand. So, let's say you have
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.860]   an ETF with a cap of 15% and you have some downside protection to 10%. But what if your
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.800]   stocks rise 15% and you're capped out, what do you do? So, you probably have to switch
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.560]   over to another fund, right? Same thing if you have the loss cap. If you're down 10%
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.040]   and you have that cap, maybe you want to switch over to a different fund that has another
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.880]   downside protection, right? So, what they have is they've actually made it a little
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.520]   easier for people who don't want to switch to a different fund. So, they have this laddered
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.120]   allocation buffer ETF, BUFB. And just equal weights across the different 12 months, because
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.800]   they have a new one of these each month that kind of resets. And it basically diversifies
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.560]   you. It's like a ladder of these buffers. So, if you look at the caps over the past
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.400]   year from all the 12 different funds that make up this fund, you could have a cap ranging
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.220]   from 13% in one fund to 23% in another. So, that depends on market conditions, like volatility
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.200]   and options trading, because these options, they become more or less valuable depending
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.840]   on when you buy them and how volatile the market is. So, this is kind of an easier way
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.240]   for people who don't want to have to really get in there and do some things, because the
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.920]   market can move pretty fast, as we've seen in the last few weeks. Obviously, we've seen
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.320]   in the last few years, for sure. So, anyway, this is an easy one for people who don't want
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.920]   to -- who just want to have a little diversification. Ladder their holdings. They don't want to
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.620]   think about it too much. They just want to get in there, have that protection. To learn
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.280]   more about this and more other Defined Outcome ETFs, remember to visit InnovatorETFs.com.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.200]   All right, Duncan, you're back from your honeymoon. Welcome back. I have an important question
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   for you.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   Thanks. Okay.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.640]   Which city is more expensive, London or New York?
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hey, Michael.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Hawaii.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.160]   Which city?
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.120]   Which city is more expensive, London or New York?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.000]   I would say New York, in my experience.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.880]   Okay, even more than London. Okay, interesting.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.240]   Sorry, that really threw me off there. I was like, who's walking in? Oh, Michael. Yeah,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.960]   I would say New York. I was actually surprised by how affordable a lot of stuff was in London.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   Okay. I guess it probably helps, being that you're converting from dollars, too, right?
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.800]   Pink dollars. See, this is where the strong dollar helps, right?
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.360]   Yeah. Like, beers, for instance. It's easy to pay $8-12 for a beer, depending on where
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.120]   you go in New York City. A lot of places there, I was paying like four pounds for a beer kind
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120]   of thing.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.760]   Yeah, I don't want to do the calculation in my head for how many dollars that is, but
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.720]   four is less than eight. We know that. Okay.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.040]   All right, John, let's look at the chart here of the S&P 500. Look where we're at now. So,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.920]   at the worst of it, the S&P 500 was down almost 24%. We've made back more than half of that
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.880]   in this little bounce here. I think the S&P is up 16% from the lows. The NASDAQ 100 is
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   up well over 20%, although it was down much more in the trough. It was down well over
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   30%. So, of course, everyone wants to know, was that the bottom? Is the bear market over?
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.960]   We're going to get into that a little bit today on the show. I don't know. I really
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.360]   don't. I wouldn't want to put my neck out either way on this. Here's the thing, though.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.600]   If you're a saver, you should hope this wasn't the bottom. Right? You should want more volatility
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.760]   to the downside. Now, this is always easier to say when stocks are going up than when
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.480]   they're going down. A few weeks ago, six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, people would not want
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.000]   to say that. But now, just remember, when stocks are going up, it's good for your current
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.480]   holdings, but it's not great for your future contributions. So, I'm kind of in a weird
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.280]   spot. I'm approaching middle age. I think I can safely say I'm almost there. I'm going
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.160]   to be, you know, let's see, a week. A week? Oh, wow. Less than a week. It's my birthday.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.400]   Yeah. I just realized that. I don't think about this stuff anymore. We should do a joint
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.720]   birthday show because my birthday is the 27th. So, like, we're relatively close. Ten days
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.200]   before you. Nice. Okay. So, I have more money in my portfolio than I did when I was in my
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.360]   20s, of course. But I still have, I don't know, a couple decades to save. So, I'm kind
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.900]   of in the middle ground where I'm diversified. If stocks go up, it feels good for my current
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.160]   portfolio, but bad for my future savings. And if stocks go down, it feels bad for my
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.760]   current portfolio, but pretty good for my future savings. So, I should hope that the
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.360]   market goes back down. Right? I'm making more money now than I did when I was younger. I'm
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.480]   saving more. I have a higher savings rate. I should want it to go down. It doesn't feel
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.580]   that way, but it's true. And especially if you're young, it's okay. You've had two bear
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.520]   markets in the last three years. I hope young people were saving in those and kept making
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.800]   their contributions. It's an unpopular opinion, but this is the way it should work. We should
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.760]   hope for a little more volatility to the downside. Now, if you have all your money in your portfolio
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.240]   and you're not saving anymore, obviously, you want new all-time highs. And guess what?
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.720]   I don't control these things, but this is my unpopular opinion. I'm hoping for more
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.760]   downside in the years to come. Either way, you have plenty of material for social media.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.800]   You can always make cracks about how bad your portfolio is doing, or you can talk about
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.880]   how well you're doing, and dunk on people and stuff. So, either way. It's a 60/40. I'm
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.840]   well-diversified. Alright, let's get into a question. Speaking of which, this is a good
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   one from a young person. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, no, that was a good weed. Okay, so up first
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.600]   we have a question from, did they give us a name? Kamal. Kamal. I have a quick question
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   that I think is pertinent to the current season we are in. Like me, a lot of fresh graduates
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.840]   are looking for a job commencing this September. I would like to know how much of your salary
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.920]   you should save every month, and how much you should invest in the stock market. For
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.480]   example, suppose you have $500 left of disposable income, what percentage should be saved and
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.840]   what percentage should be invested? You know, this one got me thinking. There's a lot of
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.880]   questions in finance that begin with how much, right? How much money do I need to save? How
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   much do I need to retire? How much money should I be spending each month? How much do I need
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.560]   for a down payment? How much house should I buy? How much money should I invest in stocks?
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.760]   How much is enough? All these things. Of course, this person is thinking about it the right
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.640]   way. They're coming from graduation. They want to save. It makes sense to begin saving
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.080]   from a young age, right? We've seen the, I'm going to use this example that a lot of people
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   use. It's totally unrealistic, but it makes the point. So, I did this for one of my books.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.920]   Sarah begins saving at 25, sets aside $500 a month until 35. At that point, she stops
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.880]   saving and just lets compound interest take the wheel, right? John waits until he's 40
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.120]   to start saving, but he keeps saving every month $500 a month until he's 65. Sarah only
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.800]   saved $66,000. John saved well over $150,000. Sarah ends up with way more than $700,000.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.600]   At the end, when she's 65, John ends up with $412,000. Now, we're using the same $500 a
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.500]   month saving, 7% on your investments, and Sarah ended up with more. Why? Because she
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.720]   started early. This is completely unrealistic, but it makes the point, right? I hope no one
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.160]   is starting saving at 25 and stopping at 35. That doesn't make sense. But the point is,
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.820]   the earlier you start, the better you are, right? That's pretty simple. Now, when it
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.480]   comes to saving and budgeting, I do think it makes sense when you're just coming into
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.720]   the working world to think about this, that there's generally two ways to approach saving
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.600]   money, right? One is like the manual approach. You track every single item that you want
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.680]   to budget for. You have a spreadsheet or some sort of tool that you follow, and then you
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.800]   make sure you track every last penny, and then at the end of the month, you have $500
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.040]   left over, and then you decide to save it. That sounds great in theory, but not many
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.400]   people can make that work in practice. I think the autopilot version is much better, where
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.920]   you automate as much of your saving and spending as possible and bill pay and all this stuff,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.060]   and then whatever's left over, you can spend on anything you want, right? But I think you
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.960]   treat saving like a bill payment. It's like Netflix subscription or a gym membership,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.760]   right? That saving is like a bill pay. It's like your utilities. So you take that saving
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.560]   first, and then anything that's left over, spend it on anything you want, especially
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.760]   when you're young. Now, my rule of thumb in terms of how much should you save, I think
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.040]   you should set yourself a savings goal, and it should probably be, my goal is always,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.520]   I want 10% of your gross income, at least. That's what I want you to work up to. Now,
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.400]   when you're young, you might not be able to get there. When I, my first job out of school,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.000]   I wasn't making anything. I think I could save $50 a month. I was trying to save, I've
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.800]   had all these bills for the first time, I'm paying for my own car and all my own insurance
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.560]   and rent, and I'm trying to save for an engagement ring for my wife, and I could only save $50
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.120]   a month. But then every time I got a raise, I would save at least half of that raise and
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.160]   work up to it. So I think I want you to work up slowly to that 10% at least. 15% would
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.720]   be great. 10% I think is a good savings goal. So what you do is you figure out how much
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.680]   you want to spend, and I think it's okay if you're young to balance that a little bit.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.420]   Still have some fun, have some guilt-free spending, but again, make that savings come
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.440]   out automatically at first, and don't wait until the end to try to save. Set a savings
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.640]   goal, increase the amount you save over time, especially every time you get a raise, save
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.000]   at least half of it. You'll never even notice it in your lifestyle. Then the rest of it,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.120]   you can kind of bump up a little bit. That's my ideal, is just get to that goal, but start
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.060]   small and build up over time.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.860]   And to clarify, you're talking about something different than like an emergency savings.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.860]   What's the rules on that?
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.300]   He's talking about stock market. I mean, people say, there's a lot of personal finance people
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.540]   who'll say six to 12 months. I think that is ridiculous for young people. I don't know
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.620]   how you can ever get to that point. It's huge. I don't think that makes sense. I think you
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.780]   have to have a decent amount. I would set more of an amount on that. I want to get to
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.940]   a goal of having $1,000 saved or 2,000, whatever makes you feel comfortable where you can have
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.940]   some sort of...
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.940]   For emergency.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.260]   Emergency, yeah. I remember my first job, I was three months out of school. I had no
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.260]   money to my name and my car broke down. And I'm like, what do I do? Hello, credit cards,
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.740]   right? So you have to have something, right? So I assume this person's talking about saving
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.740]   for retirement.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.220]   Yeah, they are. I was just for our viewers clarifying that they were just talking about
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220]   general savings.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.660]   And Kamal, if you're listening, send us an email. I will send you, because I think I
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.300]   wrote it for young people, my book, Everything You Need to Know About Saving for Retirement.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:49.460]   I'll send you a copy. Send us an email and let us know where to send it. Let's do another
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.460]   one.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.420]   Awesome. Okay. So up next, we have a question from Robert. So I know you guys have talked
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.620]   a lot about whether or not we're in a recession now and being in a bear market, equity is
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.000]   declining 20%. When is a bear market by definition over? For instance, if we just trade flat
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.900]   for the next year and then enter a recession, does this correction still count as part of
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.020]   that?
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.660]   And you guys kind of definitively on Animal Spirits this week said like, yeah, we are,
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.820]   we have not been in a recession, right?
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.020]   Right. Yeah, this one's more about a bear market, though. And this one's probably even
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:25.260]   harder than a recession. But I think, yeah, if we didn't get back to all time highs, and
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.700]   the market kind of just treads water for a while, then goes down again, because we go
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.660]   to recession in 2023 or 2024, people are going to count that as one bear market. That's the
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.700]   problem, though. You never know this stuff until after the fact. And so this is another
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.980]   one of those things that there aren't any really good definitions about. I mean, most
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.340]   people believe there was a bull market from 1982 to 2000. Right? When the tech bubble
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.780]   burst, that's when the bull market was over. But I'm sure a lot of people assumed that
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.660]   bull market was over in 1987, and stocks crashed 33% in like a week, right? So, you have cyclical
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.620]   and secular bull and bear markets, and they last at varying lengths. We have dead cat
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.100]   bounces and V-shaped recoveries and all this stuff in between. Let's look at the 2008 scenario
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.420]   as an example. So, this is the 2008. We were down 56%. You can see it took a while to get
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.060]   back to those all-time highs that were reached in October 2007. It wasn't until like early
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:19.340]   2013. But this is price only. No dividends included, right? So, if we look at what happened
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.280]   in that time, including dividends, go to the next chart, John. This is the total return.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.020]   Stocks were up 150% from the lows by the time we hit all-time highs again. That's, again,
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.740]   including dividends. So, I don't know. Did the bear market last from peak to peak? Did
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.620]   it end at the trough in March 2009 when it stopped? I don't know. Barry Ritholtz has
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.880]   some very strong opinions. He's going to be on the show again, I think, next week for
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.740]   us. He has some very strong opinions. He likes to say, "We hit new all-time highs again.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.060]   That's when the bull market starts." I don't really have strong feelings about this. They
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.740]   can both last much longer than you'd think, or be over much quicker than you'd think.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.020]   Eddie Ardeni from Ardeni Research has these really cool bull and bear market tables on
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.820]   his website, and it's free. So, I think people should check these out. So, John, pull up
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.020]   the first one. This is corrections in bear market since 1928. You can see there's a lot
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.940]   of them. I think there's like 55 or 56 on this list. It's a lot. Go to the next one
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.820]   now. This is bull markets. There's not as many bull markets as you can see. The bull
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.340]   markets tend to last longer, bear markets are shorter, and bull markets have much bigger
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.180]   gains, right? Because the bull markets outweigh the bears. It's kind of interesting. I think
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.020]   there's like 25 bull markets on here versus 55 corrections in bear markets. So, obviously,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.780]   the negative stuff hits a lot more often. And Eddie Ardeni defines a bull market as
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.580]   a 20% gain or more from a bear market trough. So, right now, if we're using his definition,
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.160]   you could say the NASDAQ 100 is in a new bull market, even though it hasn't reached the
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.900]   all-time highs yet. I don't know. I don't think it really matters. The thing to know
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.820]   is downtrends are typically more volatile than uptrends. And this is the kind of thing
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.740]   that you can probably only know in the rearview mirror. But it's probably easier, as much
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.920]   as we're arguing about it right now, about a recession or not a recession, it's probably
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.740]   easier to define that than it is to define the end of a bear market. But I think, definitively,
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.580]   once we hit all-time highs, yeah, sure, no more bear market. But if we don't, then this
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.780]   is still part of that same correction. How does that sound? Does that work?
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.380]   Yeah, that sounds fair. And I think, based on what you're saying, it really shouldn't
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.380]   impact what you're doing with your savings and investments either way, right?
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.340]   No. Although, again, people feel a lot better right now that the stock market has bounced
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.700]   15%, 20% than they did seven weeks ago, right?
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.500]   I'm glowing. I mean, just seeing some green in my portfolio feels great.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.220]   You do have a goal about you. You went on your honeymoon, stocks are up. I don't know
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.500]   how Beyond Meat's doing, but it's got to be doing better, right?
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.580]   Yeah, still down a lot. Yeah, it's up, it's up.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.740]   All right. Speaking of down a lot, let's look at another one who's got a quitter or a closer.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.420]   Yeah, I can relate. Not amount-wise, but percentage-wise. "My background is in fintech and e-commerce,
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.300]   and during the 2020-2021 boom, I took some extra cash I had laying around from the sale
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.540]   of a boat," humblebrag, "and a side business and dumped it into the high flyers that were
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.980]   benefiting greatly from the pandemic. We're talking a basket of the most painful assets
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:07.820]   to earn in 2022, PayPal, Square, Alibaba, Shopify, Coinbase, and some Bitcoin and Ethereum.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:14.620]   This $100,000 portfolio soared to $200,000 in 2021 and then crashed to $50,000 in 2022.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.340]   If I sell and take the loss, I'll still have $50,000, which would provide plenty of additional
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.460]   peace of mind to quit and focus on finding a specific opportunity that I'm looking for.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.100]   But at the same time, I hate being forced to sell at a big loss when this pile of stocks
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:35.140]   are beaten down to a pulp." This is a two-slider. "The losses wouldn't be bothering me too much
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.100]   if it wasn't for my recent desire to quit my job and focus on finding a new one. Prior
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.900]   to that, my only worry was that I'd have to wait a year or two to get another boat. Either
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.540]   way, these stocks are getting trimmed, sold, diversified at some time in the future. There's
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.060]   just something about selling at a big loss that's painful, especially when it is needed
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.820]   to free up money for something that comes with a completely different set of risks and
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.500]   uncertainties. I'd love to hear your thoughts on my situation." So, they're just kind of
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.100]   wanting some comfort, I feel like, here, you know?
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.700]   Sometimes, what you need is not data and spreadsheets. Sometimes, what you really need is a financial
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.740]   therapist. I'm here to do that. I'm here to provide that to the people. I'm not a PhD,
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.220]   but I play one on Portfolio Rescue. So, I think, this is the opposite of a not to brag,
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.900]   right? They were doing great for a while. I'm sure there's a lot of people like this,
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.700]   that high-flying stuff. And I think that's, sometimes, path dependency in the way that
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:30.020]   you invest matters a lot, because if you saw your money go from $50 to $200, right? And
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.020]   then all the way, or was it, what did he start with, $100?
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.020]   Yeah, he doubled, went from $100 to $200, and then down to $50.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.660]   $100 to $200, then down to $50. If you'd have just gone from $100 to $50, that'd be painful.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.020]   But I think it's doubly painful to go from $100 to $200, then back to $50, because you're
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.860]   anchoring to that high level, no matter what. In your mind, people think, "Okay, I'm going
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.820]   to sell once I break even." And for him, I'm sure breaking even is $200, not $100, right?
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.980]   So, there's a lot of these ... Daniel Kahneman has some of these stories. So, there's the
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.660]   San Francisco Exploratorium, where they have all this data about redwoods. And they asked
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.500]   these group of people, "Is the height of the tallest redwood tree more or less than 1,200
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.820]   feet tall?" And then they said, "What's your best guess of the tallest redwood tree?" That's
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.140]   one group of people. The next group of people, they said, "Is the height of the tallest redwood
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.460]   tree more or less than 180 feet?" And then they said, "What's your best guess?" So, they're
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.380]   anchoring these people to these numbers, right? These numbers are meaningless. They pulled
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.220]   them out of thin air. The average guesses in the first group were 844 feet, and in the
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.540]   second group, it's 282 feet. So, people take that high number and they anchor to it, and
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.940]   the low number, they anchor to it, right? This is just the way that our brain works.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.180]   I think this is why people assume, when they save money on clothing, that, "I just saved
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.380]   so much money. I bought this $100 shirt for $80. Can you believe it?" This is what my
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.260]   wife says, "Do you know how much money I saved you this week? I bought stuff on sale." So,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.620]   anchoring and investing, I think, works a little different, because we anchor to the
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.340]   high and the lows, right? If I would have just bought at the lows, I would be making
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.580]   so much money. If I would have sold at the highs, oh my gosh, I would be doing so great.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:17:01.000]   I think hindsight can play some massive head games with you. So, I think this is why defining
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.240]   your time horizon matters so much. So, again, this person sounds like, this is almost the
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.420]   kind of thing that went from an investment to a trade, right? They sold their boat, I'm
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.660]   going to put it in here, and if I can just buy another boat with it, I'll make a little
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.820]   money. Maybe I can buy a bigger boat and a better boat with a bigger motor or whatever.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.980]   Now, the goal has changed, and that's fine, because this happens sometimes. You can say,
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.940]   oh, an investment turned into a trade, but that's okay if your goal changes. This person's
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.980]   goal changed from, "I've got a little bit of extra money from selling a boat," to, "Oh,
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.900]   wait, I might want to quit my job and try something new." I think, at that point, throw
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.460]   that original thesis out the window, right? What matters more to your happiness in life?
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.220]   A missed opportunity? Let's say you turn this $50 into $100, because the stock market screams
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.540]   higher from here. Is that going to make you feel better than going for your desired career
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.300]   goal? Of course, how much joy do you get if you hold that $50 to $100, or $150, whatever
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.740]   it is, versus how much happiness do you get from pursuing your dream job? I think you
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.900]   can't put a price on that. If that money is going to make you feel good and allow you
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:02.980]   to pursue your career aspirations, I don't know why you would, it's a pretty simple choice
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:08.660]   for me. It's going to sting if you see, "Oh, this stock doubled after I sold it." I don't
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.220]   think you can look at the opportunity set that way when you have this type of goal in
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.980]   mind. Yeah, and I think that they could still have plenty of fun with a jet ski, you know
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:23.460]   what I mean? They could join the jet ski lobby. If they can get one, right? I'm in the process
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.580]   of selling mine. I'm out. I'm totally out of the jet skis. Sorry. Really? I didn't use
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.900]   it enough. Wow, okay. Sorry. Well, I figured you could rent it out or something, right?
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.180]   Yeah, Uber for jet skis. Is there an Uber for jet skis? Maybe. People are paying up,
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.260]   so I'm just going to, I'm selling it. I'm out. I'm going to be like this guy. I'm going
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.620]   to sell it and put it on the PayPal and Square and Shopify. Maybe not. All right, let's do
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.340]   another one. Okay. So up next, we have a question from Rishi. "My dad has about two million
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.020]   in a traditional IRA and is working five more years to get Medicare. He does not want to
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.580]   have a high RME, so he wants to take money out now, but with him working, it will lead
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.220]   to a higher taxable income. He wants to invest in real estate and buy a bigger property,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.400]   logic being that if he is going to take money out, he would like the money to go to interest
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.860]   and property taxes to write off his income rather than straight to the government. What
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.360]   are your thoughts on the best ways to reduce taxes, specifically regarding RMDs?" Got to
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.020]   be honest, I don't understand a whole lot of that question. Do you remember RMDs? Required
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.140]   minimum distribution. Yeah. So for an IRA, at a certain point, you have to take a certain
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.580]   amount out. Okay. Let's bring in a tax expert on this, because this is a tax question, retirement.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.500]   So let's bring in one of my top two favorite bills who works at Redults Wealth Management
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.940]   in the tax department. He's in the top two. Bill Arts. I don't have a definitive ranking
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.660]   system. Bill Arts, you're in. Top two. I love it. All right. Bill, I can't put my finger
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.060]   on this one, but it doesn't seem to add up. So the idea here is I know I'm going to have
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.820]   to take this money out of my IRA. I'm just going to take the tax hit now, and I'm going
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.740]   to buy some property with it, and that way my RMDs will be lower in retirement. I won't
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.700]   be forced to take this money out. This seems like a little backwards way of thinking to
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:04.380]   people. What are we missing here? Yeah. I don't love this. First of all, well done to
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.580]   Rishi. You're pops. He's 60. He's got $2 million in an IRA, and he's looking to reduce his
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:15.580]   future income. He's looking at a pretty comfortable retirement. So just general lesson on RMDs,
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.580]   required distributions. They start at age 72 from retirement accounts. That first year
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:28.040]   is about 3.6%. If your dad's worried about higher income in the future, higher RMDs,
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.300]   he's in the minority. Most savers, once they hang it up and call it quits from work, they're
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.360]   immediately pulling out from their retirement accounts to live on. Rishi, I think your instincts
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.460]   are correct here. What IRA withdrawals while your dad is working, what that's going to
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.900]   do is it's going to stack income on top of income, and it's going to cause him to pay
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:53.140]   a higher rate on these IRA withdrawals than he probably will in the future. This is probably,
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.700]   based on the information we have, this looks like an optimal Roth conversion case for your
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.620]   dad. As my man, Bill Sweet, always puts it, all roads lead back to a Roth conversion.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.900]   We talk about him a lot around here. I should have known it was coming. Yeah, every time,
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:12.820]   every time. The reason for this is it sounds like dad's targeting at age 65 retirement
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:20.820]   if he's looking to target Medicare upon retirement. Based on his savings rate that we can assume,
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:27.020]   he may be able to defer Social Security until age 70, and his RMD start at 72. Between 65
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:33.900]   and 70, he may have this period of five years where he has super low income. During this
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.940]   five years, John, could you throw that chart on? I've always wanted to say it. Here's a
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.340]   look at some ordinary income tax and long-term capital gains rates. This was built by the
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.540]   team at Kitsis.com a few years ago. I updated it for 2022 rates. Based on dad's IRA balance
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:56.500]   of $2 million right now, I think it's safe to say he's at least in this 22% tax bracket,
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   maybe 24, maybe higher. Then at age 72, this IRA is going to be worth $3, $3.5 million,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:11.500]   so that first-year RMD is going to be north of probably $125,000. At 72, he's probably
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:19.620]   in the 24% rate. There may be an opportunity, starting at age 65, to withdraw, to convert
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:25.420]   IRA money to Roth at maybe 12%, maybe 22%. What you're doing with the Roth conversion
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.980]   here is you're choosing to pay tax early, but at a potentially lower rate than you will
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.300]   in the future. I guess the point, too, is that if you're going to pull it out to pay
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.700]   the taxes anyway, you might as well put it in a vehicle that's still tax advantage, right?
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.680]   That's the point of the Roth conversion. That's right. The Roth conversion gives you kind
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.300]   of three benefits. Number one is that IRA money is going to be taxed at some point,
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.820]   so you might as well take advantage and pay at the lowest tax rate possible. Number two
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.620]   is the amounts that are converted to Roth are all going to grow tax-free. Rishi, this
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.120]   may benefit you. If dad is really comfortable living at a low rate, this may go to Rishi
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.900]   as an inheritance, and he could have tax-free money. Then to dad's point-
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.140]   Say, "Dad, the Roth is for the grandkids." Well, yeah. In theory, you want to leave that
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:18.300]   Roth alone to grow tax-free as long as possible. For dad, his goal was to reduce his RMDs and
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.540]   the amounts converted to Roth. The Roth account doesn't have a required distribution date,
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.700]   so he is lowering his future RMDs. One more thing here. Does it ever make sense?
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:34.220]   Is real estate a good, taxable vehicle for retirement? There's a lot of pain points when
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.700]   you own real estate if you're renting it out, but are there any pros for investing some
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.300]   money in real estate in retirement? Yeah, this is a big "it depends." If it's
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.020]   not a rental property, you're pretty limited in what you can write off. If it is a rental
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:55.340]   property and you're age 70+, you may not want to manage a rental property when you're retired.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.300]   It's not my favorite for retired people, and if you're not renting it, the tax benefits
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.980]   just aren't as strong as if you are renting. Counterpoint if we're trying to help Rishi
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.780]   out here. If he says, "Dad, buy a place in Florida on the beach," maybe that's a good
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.900]   idea. Some place for me to come visit. I'd sign off on that.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:18.420]   Sounds good to me. Also, Rishi said they listen to our show on
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:28.100]   their evening walks, so thanks for listening. Colin writes, "My wife and I recently got
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.300]   married and are trying to figure out the best way to navigate the tax portion of things.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.140]   So romantic. Especially with getting married halfway through the year."
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.100]   Duncan, is this what you talked about on the Air Flight over to your honeymoon? What tax
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.940]   bracket are we going to be in, honey? Yeah. "Filing jointly this year, we are going
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.900]   to be borderline between 32% and 35% tax bracket. Our salaries put us close to that limit. However,
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.700]   I also have a few side hustles, like personal training. With personal training, I work for
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.320]   a company and receive a W-2, minimal amount, approximately $2,000. And the other, I claim
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.260]   at the end of the year as it's my own business. Is there ever a scenario where it makes sense
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:09.500]   not to work in order to avoid being bumped up a tax bracket? If it's something where
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.700]   I would not want to miss the income of the company I'm training for, is there more
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:21.700]   upside in stopping that side hustle?" Now, this is the kind of thing where people
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.780]   say, "Why would I want to make a million dollars? I've got to pay 50% taxes on it."
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.460]   Does it ever make sense to have that theory, if you say, "Why would I make more money
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.460]   because I'm going to pay taxes on it?" Doesn't it always make sense to make more money?
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.220]   Yeah, this is kind of like, "Do people turn down raises to avoid more taxes?" You know
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.900]   what I mean? I mean, I know if you're really, really close,
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.660]   I don't know. Does it ever really make sense, Bill?
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:46.020]   General rule of thumb, no. Earning a dollar is better than not earning a dollar. Even
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:52.300]   after paying taxes, you're going to have more money net than you otherwise would. In Colin's
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.100]   case, we're talking about a side hustle, so that could change his math on this. The big
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:03.360]   reason why you still want to earn the dollar is ordinary income tax rates are marginal.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.460]   If Colin jumps from 32% to 35%, all of his income isn't taxed at 35%. It's only the amount
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.340]   over that threshold. John, can we throw that chart up one more time? For reference, these
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.460]   are- Bill, chart on. Come on. Chart on.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.900]   Chart on. My mistake. I'll get used to it. There you go.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.420]   These are ordinary income rates. If Colin's side hustle, his personal training pushes
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:30.060]   him up from 32% to 35%, only the amount over that threshold is taxed at the higher rate.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.300]   I think to answer Colin's question, "Should I stop my side hustle?" It's really not about
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.260]   tax. I think with a side hustle, we should think about this with two different questions.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:44.220]   Number one is, "Colin, are you relying on this income?" If you're pushing the 35% tax
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.620]   bracket, you're $400,000, $500,000 plus in the income. Is a side hustle earning a few
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.900]   thousand bucks, is that material to your income and your wealth? Maybe not. Everybody's financial
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.740]   plan is different, but that might not move the needle for you.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:05.860]   Question two is, "Do you enjoy the side hustle?" Since this is not moving the needle financially,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:11.660]   do you value the side hustle income more than your free time? In a highest tax scenario,
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:17.740]   Colin lives in California, and if he's pushing 35% on the Fed rate, he's at 9.3% in California,
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:23.460]   so effectively, he's going to earn $0.56 for every dollar. He's going to net $0.56 for
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.260]   every dollar that he earns. For Colin as a side hustle, is $0.56 on the dollar worth
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.260]   it?
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.540]   That's a good point. Him and his wife are already making decent income. The side hustle
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.780]   is not bringing in that much on top of it. Is the time worth it to go ahead and keep
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.740]   doing that personal training on the side?
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.540]   Right. I would never tell somebody, "Turn down a raise," or, "Stop working in December
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.980]   to not go over a tax threshold," but for a side hustle, it's really a matter of how
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.540]   much do you value your time versus how much income are you getting off of the side hustle?
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.980]   Based on their income, I'm guessing they do this more because they enjoy it, right? That's
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:03.380]   what it sounds like to me. I think they probably just enjoy the personal training is my bet.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.140]   I'm just happy seeing all this data that Bill is sharing. I'm just happy our tax code is
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:13.260]   so simple and easy to understand. That's what I'm always grateful for.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:23.060]   Yeah, always. If you're listening to this in podcast form, leave us a review. Duncan
