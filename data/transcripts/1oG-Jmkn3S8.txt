[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   - Well, it is no secret that Jonathan Edwards
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.000]   has shaped you profoundly, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.360]   And as we heard earlier in the week,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.160]   back in episode number 554,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160]   you explained a little bit about how
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.920]   and why that has happened.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.080]   And Andy writes in to ask this.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.400]   Pastor John, if you could ask Jonathan Edwards one question,
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.360]   what would you ask him?
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.840]   - Well, I'm assuming that these answers to APJ
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840]   should be longer than 30 seconds.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.800]   - Right, yes.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   - So I'm going to fudge on the question
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.240]   and instead of answering what one question
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.200]   would you ask Edwards,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.480]   I'm going to answer what one kind of question
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.240]   would you ask Edwards and then give a bunch of examples
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.560]   and fill up the time we're supposed to take.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.180]   I would not ask Edwards anything about theology.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.960]   Not because it isn't important.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.640]   It has been the most important source of inspiration
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.100]   and insight for me outside the Bible, more than anybody.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.960]   Edwards is at the top of that list.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560]   The reason I wouldn't ask him about his theology
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.120]   is that I think he has been so full and so clear
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.300]   on what he thinks theologically
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.080]   that if he hasn't written about it,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.000]   then it's probably not important to him
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   and he doesn't want to talk about it.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.820]   And if it's not plain there,
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.520]   I doubt that he can improve on it.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.240]   And so I'm not going to go there with him
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240]   because I think he's done us the great service
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760]   of putting it in books
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.440]   and he should expect that I would read them.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   So that's not the direction my questions are going to go.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.760]   I'm going to go where 18th century Puritan type preachers
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.080]   were not willing to go, namely about their private life.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   You will read two volumes or 25 Yale volumes
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.240]   of Edwards' works and find almost zero references
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   to his family or his personal life
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000]   or his struggles or anything.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.680]   So I'm going to put him on the spot big time
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.360]   if I get a chance to meet him.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.120]   And he probably will not answer a bunch of these
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.760]   just because the way 18th century people are wired,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.160]   but I'm going to ask him anyway.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.600]   Mr. Edwards, you had 11 children.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.380]   Was that intentional?
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.400]   Did you want 11 children?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.360]   Could you have had more?
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.920]   Mr. Edwards, it's simply astonishing and wonderful
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.140]   that all your children walked with the Lord,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.600]   as far as I know, till the day they died.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.500]   Can you give me any insight
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.360]   into what your relationship with them was like?
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   Since you have the reputation of working in your study
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   13 hours a day, can you help me understand
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.560]   a little bit of how you discipled your children?
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.360]   Mr. Edwards, can you describe any of your own battles
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.920]   with temptation to sin?
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   I'm thinking about sexual lust and anger and pride.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.880]   What were your battles like?
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.520]   How did you mortify these sins?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   Mr. Edwards, did you ever have misgivings
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.100]   about the pattern of your parish ministry,
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.020]   giving so much time to study and writing?
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.300]   How did you make those choices in a God-honoring way,
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.920]   whether to write or read and study,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.720]   or whether to visit and evangelize and disciple?
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.160]   Mr. Edwards, would you tell me
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.880]   about some of the sweetest times
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   you enjoyed in communion with God?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.320]   What were they like?
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   Were there patterns of devotion that led into those times?
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.720]   I know you've written just a little bit
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.840]   in your personal narrative about a horse ride once,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.620]   but you didn't say much more after that.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.620]   I'd love to know what your pattern of devotional life,
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.600]   or, Mr. Edwards, would you tell me
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.520]   about your devotional Bible reading,
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.360]   or did you even distinguish between reading your Bible
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.120]   for personal enjoyment of God
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   and reading it for study of doctrine
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.080]   or scripture in general?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.480]   How did you mingle prayer with Bible reading?
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.560]   Were they separate?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.200]   Did you pause?
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.940]   Did you have lists in your prayer?
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.840]   Did you have a pattern of prayer, a time for prayer?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.200]   How did it look?
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.320]   Mr. Edwards, what books did you consult most often
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   in your study of the Bible?
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.360]   How important was a concordance to you?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.840]   I don't even know if you had a Greek concordance
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.800]   and a Hebrew concordance.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.720]   Did you?
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.760]   Did you use them?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.160]   I'm just amazed at how much scripture you quote.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.120]   (laughs)
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.680]   On any topic, you string 10 texts together
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.120]   and I just wonder how you found them,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.640]   or are they all in your head?
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.280]   Mr. Edwards, you are known for being in touch
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.360]   with cultural currents of the day, like philosophy.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.220]   How did you include reading of John Locke
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.040]   or other philosophers in your pastoral work, in your study?
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.840]   Was there a plan for that?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.360]   Or did, when a book was published,
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.520]   you just happened to kick back and read it?
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.000]   Or how did you mingle cultural reading
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.520]   with theological study?
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.440]   Mr. Edwards, would you be surprised
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.880]   that thousands of people, scholars, pastors,
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   lay people in the 21st century are studying your works
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.740]   250 years later?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.720]   Thank you, Mr. Edwards, for all that you have given us.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.960]   Very insightful, yes.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.640]   It would have been great to get more
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.080]   of the personal detail from Edwards' life
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.960]   and perhaps someday we will know more about him.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.040]   Thank you, Pastor John, and for the question, Andy.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.760]   And thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.240]   Well, does God want me most to be happy or to be holy?
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.360]   That's a question from Josh tomorrow.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.080]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.280]   (silence)
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.440]   (silence)
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.600]   (silence)
