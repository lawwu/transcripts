[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.720]   Today, my guest is Dr. Eric Jarvis.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.120]   Dr. Jarvis is a professor
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.920]   at the Rockefeller University in New York City,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.520]   and his laboratory studies the neurobiology
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.100]   of vocal learning, language, speech disorders,
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800]   and remarkably, the relationship between language, music,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520]   and movement, in particular, dance.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.200]   His work spans from genomics,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.840]   so the very genes that make up our genome,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.320]   and the genomes of other species that speak
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.840]   and have language, such as songbirds and parrots,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.400]   all the way up to neural circuits,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.680]   that is the connections in the brain and body
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.520]   that govern our ability to learn
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   and generate specific sounds and movements coordinated
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.160]   with those sounds, including hand movements,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.300]   and all the way up to cognition,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.040]   that is our ability to think in specific ways
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.540]   based on what we are saying
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.880]   and the way that we comprehend what other people are saying,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.840]   singing, and doing.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.680]   As you'll soon see, I was immediately transfixed
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.040]   and absolutely enchanted by Dr. Jarvis's description
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.280]   of his work and the ways that it impacts
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520]   all the various aspects of our lives.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.640]   For instance, I learned from Dr. Jarvis
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.660]   that as we read, we are generating very low levels
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.940]   of motor activity in our throat,
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.480]   that is, we are speaking the words that we are reading
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.920]   at a level below the perception of sound
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.320]   or our own perception of those words,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.920]   but if one were to put an amplifier
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.240]   to measure the firing of those muscles in our vocal cords,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   we'd find that as we're reading information,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.840]   we are actually speaking that information,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.860]   and as I learned and you'll soon learn,
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.060]   there's a direct link between those species in the world
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.400]   that have song and movement,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.500]   which many of us would associate with dance,
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   and our ability to learn and generate complex language.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.540]   So for people with speech disorders like stutter
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.860]   or for people who are interested
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.900]   in multiple language learning,
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.940]   bilingual, trilingual, et cetera,
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.340]   and frankly, for anyone who is interested
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.060]   in how we communicate through words, written or spoken,
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.780]   I'm certain today's episode is going to be
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.660]   an especially interesting and important one for you.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.800]   Dr. Jarvis's work is so pioneering
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.220]   that he has been awarded truly countless awards.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.460]   I'm not going to take our time
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.980]   to list off all the various important awards
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.100]   that he's received, but I should point out
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.780]   that in addition to being a decorated professor
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.260]   at the Rockefeller University,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.400]   he is also an investigator
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.180]   with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.260]   the so-called HHMI,
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.820]   and for those of you that don't know,
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.340]   HHMI investigators are selected
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.060]   on an extremely competitive basis
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.620]   that they have to re-up.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.120]   That is, they have to re-compete every five years.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.060]   They actually receive a grade every five years
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.280]   that dictates whether or not
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.940]   they are no longer a Howard Hughes investigator,
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.260]   whether or not they can advance to another five years
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.400]   of funding for their important research,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.820]   and indeed, Howard Hughes investigators are selected
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.620]   not just for the rigor of their work,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.200]   but for their pioneering spirit
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.460]   and their ability to take on high-risk, high-benefit work,
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.740]   which is exactly the kind of work
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.100]   that Dr. Jarvis has been providing for decades now.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.540]   Again, I think today's episode
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.500]   is one of the more unique and special episodes
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.140]   that we've had on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.680]   I single it out because it really spans
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.500]   from the basic to the applied,
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.160]   and Dr. Jarvis's story is an especially unique one
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.060]   in terms of how he arrived at becoming a neurobiologist.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.620]   So for those of you that are interested
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.800]   in personal journey and personal story,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.700]   Dr. Jarvis's is truly a special and important one.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.580]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.900]   is now partnered with Momentus supplements.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.140]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.820]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.740]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.240]   outside of the United States.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.260]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.800]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.460]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.420]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.060]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.260]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.300]   and that are supplied in dosages
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.280]   that allow you to build a supplementation protocol
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.000]   that's optimized for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.140]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.460]   from your protocol in a way
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.260]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.440]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.760]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.860]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.000]   There you'll see those supplements
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.460]   and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.160]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.100]   on a regular basis.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.640]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.000]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.720]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.520]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.060]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.660]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.660]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.580]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.900]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.380]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.840]   to help you better meet your immediate
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.460]   and long-term health goals.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.180]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.380]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.220]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.020]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.220]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.100]   you can also get insight into, for example,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.480]   what your biological age is
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.440]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.180]   The problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.940]   however, is you get information back
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.440]   about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth,
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.160]   but you don't know what to do with
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.780]   or about that information.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.520]   InsideTracker solves that problem with a simple platform
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.140]   that allows you to click on any specific factor,
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.700]   learn more about it and what it does in your brain and body,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.420]   and also the various nutritional supplementation
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.420]   and other types of interventions you can take
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.220]   to bring the levels of that factor into the ranges
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.100]   that are optimal for you and your health.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.480]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.200]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.980]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.740]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.060]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.940]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.960]   They also have some really unique features
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.140]   that make them especially attractive
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.420]   from the standpoint of aesthetics and performance.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.400]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.300]   from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.920]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.720]   Initially, the eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.760]   were designed for sport,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   that is for running and for cycling, et cetera.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.180]   And indeed, still their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.180]   are very lightweight and they won't slip off your face
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.120]   if you get sweaty, but they also have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.740]   You can wear them to work, you can wear them out to eat.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.880]   I wear readers at night when I work or if I drive
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.660]   and I wear sunglasses sometimes during the middle of the day
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.380]   if it's too bright and I need sunglasses in order to see.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.020]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.540]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.640]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.420]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.600]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.860]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.520]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.160]   meaning no sugar, but plenty of the correct ratios
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.760]   of sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.040]   And those three electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.780]   and potassium are critical for your neuron,
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.120]   your nerve cell function, and for the function
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.600]   of all the cells in your brain and body.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.520]   I've mentioned this before on the podcast,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.020]   but I'm a fan of salt, not taking too much salt,
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.320]   but certainly not getting too little salt.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.200]   Element has 1000 milligrams, that is one gram of salt,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.420]   which might sound like a lot of salt, but for many people,
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.220]   especially people who are following low carbohydrate diets
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.700]   or who are exercising or sweating a lot or both,
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.940]   that level of salt can actually help you
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.100]   in many circumstances.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.520]   Getting the appropriate level of salt
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.240]   and certainly the appropriate levels of electrolytes
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.740]   will improve your cognitive function

[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.360]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Eric Jarvis.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.060]   Eric, so great to have you here.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.900]   - Thank you.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.200]   - Yeah, very interested in learning from you
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.900]   about speech and language.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.020]   And even as I asked the question,
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.820]   I realized that a lot of people, including myself,
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.220]   probably don't fully appreciate the distinction
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.540]   between speech and language, right?
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.440]   Speech, I think of as the motor patterns,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.740]   the production of sound that has meaning, hopefully,
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.100]   and language, of course, come in various languages
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.860]   and varieties of ways of communicating.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.740]   But in terms of the study of speech and language
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.540]   and thinking about how the brain
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.740]   organizes speech and language,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.420]   what are the similarities?
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.380]   What are the differences?
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.180]   How should we think about speech and language?
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.800]   - Yeah, well, I'm glad you invited me here
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.900]   and I'm also glad to get that first question,
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.580]   which I consider a provocative one.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.420]   The reason why, I've been struggling,
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.380]   what is the difference with speech and language
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.760]   for many years and realize why am I struggling
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.100]   is because there are behavioral terms,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.720]   let's call them psychology developed kind of terms,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.660]   that don't actually align exactly with brain function, right?
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.420]   And the question is there a distinction
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.660]   between speech and language?
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.980]   And when I look at the brain of work
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.060]   that other people have done, work we have done,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.900]   also compared it with animal models
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.380]   like those who can imitate sounds,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.620]   like parrots and songbirds,
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.620]   I start to see there really isn't such a sharp distinction.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.380]   So to get at what I think is going on,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.740]   let me tell you how some people think of it now,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.420]   that there's a separate language module in the brain
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.320]   that has all the algorithms and computations
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.340]   that influence the speech pathway on how to produce sound
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.160]   and the auditory pathway on how to perceive
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   and interpret it for speech or for sound that we call speech.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   And it turns out, I don't think there is any good evidence
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.600]   for a separate language module.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.260]   Instead, there is a speech production pathway
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.640]   that's controlling our larynx,
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.820]   controlling our jaw muscles that has built within it
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.120]   all the complex algorithms for spoken language.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.680]   And there's the auditory pathway
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.300]   that has built within it all the complex algorithms
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.980]   for understanding speech,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.320]   not separate from a language module.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.260]   And the speech production pathway is specialized to humans
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.540]   and parrots and songbirds,
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.260]   whereas this auditory perception pathway
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.140]   is more ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.160]   And this is why dogs can understand sit, siente se,
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.860]   come here boy, get the ball and so forth.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.580]   Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words,
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.300]   great apes, you can teach them for several thousand,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.780]   but they can't say a word.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.360]   - Fascinating.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.140]   Because you've raised a number of animal species
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.740]   early on here and because I have basically an obsession
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.580]   with animals since the time I was very small,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.580]   I have to ask which animals have language?
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.000]   Which animals have modes of communication
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.060]   that are sort of like language?
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.900]   - Yeah.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.360]   - You know, I've heard whale songs.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.540]   I don't know what they're saying.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.540]   They sound very beautiful,
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.740]   but they could be insulting each other for all I know.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.180]   And they very well may be.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.740]   Dolphins, birds.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.460]   I mean, what do we understand about modes of communication
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.800]   that are like language,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.420]   but might not be what would classically be called language?
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.580]   - Right, so modes of communication
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.300]   that people would define as language,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.180]   more in a very narrow definition,
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.020]   they would say production of sound, so speech.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.640]   But what about the hands, the gesturing with the hands?
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.260]   What about a bird who is doing aerial displays in the air,
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.660]   communicating information through body language, right?
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.760]   Well, I'm gonna go back to the brain.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   So what I think is going on is for spoken language,
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.940]   we're using the speech pathway
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.000]   in all the complex algorithms there.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.280]   Next to the brain regions that are controlling spoken language
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.400]   are the brain regions for gesturing with the hands.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   And that hand parallel pathway
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.400]   has also complex algorithms that we can utilize.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.560]   And some species are more advanced in these circuits,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.320]   whether it's sound or gesturing with hands,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.900]   and some are less advanced.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.300]   Now, we humans and a few others are the most advanced
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.380]   for the speech sounds or the spoken language,
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.320]   but a non-human primate can produce gesturing
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.220]   in a more advanced form than they could produce sound.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.380]   I'm not sure I got that across clearly,
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.960]   just to say that humans are the most advanced
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.420]   at spoken language, but not necessarily
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.320]   as big a difference at gestural language
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.300]   compared to some other species.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.500]   - Very clear and very interesting
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.460]   and immediately prompts the question,
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.740]   have there been brain imaging or other sorts of studies
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.560]   evaluating neural activity in the context of cultures
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.260]   and languages, at least that I associate
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.560]   with a lot of hand movement, like Italian versus,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.540]   I don't know, maybe you could give us some examples
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.580]   of cultures where language is not associated
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.540]   with as much overt hand movement.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.720]   - Yes, so as you and I are talking here today
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.040]   and people who are listening but can't see us,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.400]   we're actually gesturing with our hands as we talk.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.500]   Without knowing it or doing it unconsciously.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.080]   And if we were talking on a telephone,
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.000]   I would have one hand here and I'd be gesturing
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.460]   with the other hand without even you seeing me, right?
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.580]   And so why is that?
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.500]   Some have argued, and I would agree
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.200]   based upon what we've seen,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.780]   is that there is an evolutionary relationship
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.920]   between the brain pathways that control
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.420]   speech production and gesturing.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.980]   And the brain regions I mentioned
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.500]   are directly adjacent to each other.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.520]   And why is that?
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.160]   I think that the brain pathways that control speech
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.200]   evolved out of the brain pathways
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.160]   that control body movement, all right?
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   And that when you talk about Italian, French,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.700]   English, and so forth, each one of those languages
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.180]   come with a learned set of gestures
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.180]   that you can communicate with.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.200]   Now how is that related to other animals?
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.980]   Well, Coco, a gorilla, who was raised with humans
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.980]   for 39 years or more, learned how to do gesture,
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.660]   communication, learned how to sign language, so to speak.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.100]   But Coco couldn't produce those sounds.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.380]   Coco could understand them as well
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:56.220]   by seeing somebody sign or hearing somebody produce speech.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.820]   But Coco couldn't produce it with her voice.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.580]   And so what's going on there is that
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.300]   a number of species, not all of them,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.180]   a number of species have motor pathways in the brain
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.500]   where you can do learned gesturing,
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.740]   rudimentary language if you wanted, say, with your limbs,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.860]   even if it's not as advanced as humans.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.820]   But they don't have this extra brain pathway for the sound.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.180]   So they can't gesture with their voice
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.580]   in the way that they gesture with their hands.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.820]   - I see.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.100]   One thing that I've wondered about for a very long time
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:32.100]   is whether or not primitive emotions
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.180]   and primitive sounds are the early substrate of language.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.180]   And whether or not there's a bridge
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.960]   that we can draw between those
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.540]   in terms of just the basic respiration systems
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.180]   associated with different extreme feelings.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.620]   Here's the way I'm imagining this might work.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.500]   When I smell something delicious,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.060]   I typically inhale more,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.300]   and I might say mm, or something like that.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.100]   Whereas if I smell something putrid,
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.140]   I typically turn away, I wince, and I will exhale,
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.900]   you know, or sort of kind of like turn away,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.060]   trying to not ingest those molecules
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.820]   or inhale those molecules.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.900]   I could imagine that these are the basic
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.980]   dark and light contrasts of the language system.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.820]   And as I say that,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.100]   I'm saying that from the orientation of a vision scientist
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.100]   who thinks of all visual images built up
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.180]   in a very basic way of a hierarchical model
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.180]   of the ability to see dark and light.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.420]   So I could imagine this kind of primitive
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:38.420]   to more sophisticated pyramid of sound to language.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.600]   Is this a crazy idea?
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.460]   Do we have any evidence this is the way it works?
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.100]   - No, it's not a crazy idea.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.860]   And in fact, you hit upon one of the key distinctions
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.500]   in the field of research that I had started out in,
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.540]   which is vocal learning research.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.180]   So for vocal communication,
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.700]   we have most vertebrate species vocalize,
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.420]   but most of them are producing innate sounds
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.260]   that they're born with producing.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.380]   That is babies crying, for example, or dogs barking.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.780]   And only a few species have learned vocal communication,
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.500]   the ability to imitate sounds.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.540]   And that is what makes spoken language special.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.740]   When people think of what's special about language,
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.700]   it's the learned vocalizations.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.180]   That is what's rare.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.820]   And so this distinction between innateness and learned
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.620]   is more of a bigger dichotomy when it comes to vocalizations
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.900]   than for other behaviors in the animal kingdom.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.380]   And when you go in the brain, you see it there as well.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.540]   And so all the things you talked about,
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.900]   the breathing, the grunting, and so forth,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.220]   a lot of that is handled by the brainstem circuits,
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.980]   you know, right around the level of your neck and below.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.660]   Like a reflex kind of thing.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.500]   So, or even some emotional aspects of your behavior
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.500]   in the hypothalamus and so forth.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.820]   But for a learned behavior, learning how to speak,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.660]   learning how to play the piano,
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.380]   teaching a dog to learn how to do tricks
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.940]   is using the forebrain circuits.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.540]   And what has happened is that there's a lot
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   of forebrain circuits that are controlling
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.380]   learning how to move body parts in these species,
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.180]   but not for the vocalizations.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.580]   But in humans and in parrots and some other species,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.140]   somehow we acquired circuits where the forebrain
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.100]   has taken over the brainstem,
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.020]   and now using that brainstem not only to produce
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.180]   the innate behaviors or vocal behaviors,
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.580]   but the learned ones as well.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.700]   - Do we have any sense of when modern
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.900]   or sophisticated language evolved?
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.140]   You know, thinking back to the species that we evolved from
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.500]   and even within homo sapiens,
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.340]   has there been an evolution of language?
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.980]   Has there been a devolution of language?
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.980]   - Yeah, I would say, and to be able to answer that question,
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.300]   it does come with the caveat that I think we humans
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.900]   overrate ourselves when it compared to other species.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.100]   And so it makes even scientists go astray
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.820]   in trying to hypothesize when you especially
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.900]   don't find fossil evidence of language
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   that easily out there in terms of what happened in the past.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:35.660]   We, amongst the primates, which we humans belong to,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.060]   we are the only ones that have this advanced
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.420]   vocal learning ability.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:45.340]   Now, when it was assumed that it was only homo sapiens,
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:50.860]   then you can go back in time now based upon genomic data,
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.620]   not only of us living humans, but of the fossils
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.300]   that have been found for homo sapiens of Neanderthals,
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   of Denisovan individuals, and discover that our ancestor,
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.980]   our human ancestors supposedly hybridized
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.660]   with these other hominid species.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.500]   And it was assumed that these other hominid species
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.380]   don't learn how to imitate sounds.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.980]   I don't know of any species today that's a vocal learner
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.180]   that can have children with a non vocal learning species.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.020]   I don't see it.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.940]   It doesn't mean it didn't exist.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.740]   And when we look at the genetic data
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.740]   from these ancestral hominids where we can look at genes
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.380]   that are involved in learning vocal communication,
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.900]   they have the same sequence as we humans do
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.620]   for genes that function in speech circuits.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.180]   So I think Neanderthals had spoken language.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.820]   I'm not gonna say it's as advanced as what it is in humans.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.100]   I don't know.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.380]   But I think it's been there for at least between 500,000
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.380]   to a million years that our ancestors had this ability
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.500]   and that we've been coming more and more advanced
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.140]   with it culturally and possibly genetically.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.820]   But I think it's evolved sometime
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.140]   in the last 500,000 to a million years.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.980]   - Incredible.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.580]   Maybe we could talk a little bit more about the overlap
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.420]   between brain circuits that control language and speech
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.500]   in humans and other animals.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.260]   - Yeah, I was weaned in the neuroscience era
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.580]   where bird song and the ability of birds
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.020]   to learn their tutor's song was and still is
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.900]   a prominent field, subfield of neuroscience.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.980]   And then of course, neuroimaging of humans speaking
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.540]   and learning, et cetera.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.180]   And this notion of a critical period,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.420]   a time in which language is learned more easily
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.180]   than it is later in life.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.820]   And the names of the different brain areas
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.500]   were quite different.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.140]   If one opens the textbooks,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.620]   we hear Wernicke's and Broca's for the humans
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.940]   and you look at the birds.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.700]   I remember, you know.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.540]   - HPC.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.860]   - Yeah, Robust Arch Triatum, Area X.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.780]   - That's right, yes.
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.780]   - Et cetera.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.620]   But for most of our listeners,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.020]   those names won't mean a whole lot.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.820]   But in terms of homologies between areas
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.620]   in terms of function, what do we know
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.260]   and how similar or different are the brain areas
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.420]   controlling speech and language in say a songbird
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   and a young human child?
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.060]   - Yeah, so going back to the 1950s
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.260]   or even a little earlier and Peter Mahler
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.460]   and others who got involved in neuroethology,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.780]   the study of neurobiology of behavior
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.300]   in a natural way, right?
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.860]   You know, they start to find that behaviorally,
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.580]   there are these species of birds like songbirds and parents
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.060]   and now we also know hummingbirds, just three of them
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.060]   out of the 40-something bird groups out there
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.020]   on the planet, orders,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.700]   that they can imitate sounds like we do.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.420]   And so that was the similarity.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.220]   In other words, they had this kind of behavior
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.300]   that's more similar to us than chimpanzees have with us
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.700]   or than chickens have with them, right?
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.300]   They're close to relatives.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.660]   And then they discovered even more similarities,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.180]   these critical periods that if you remove a child,
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.700]   you know, this unfortunately happens
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.740]   where a child is feral and is not raised with human
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.060]   and goes through their puberty phase of growth,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.300]   becomes hard for them to learn a language as an adult.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.100]   So there's this critical period where you learn best.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.460]   And even later on when you're in regular society,
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.620]   it's hard to learn.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.580]   Well, the birds undergo the same thing.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.060]   And then it was discovered that if they become deaf,
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.700]   we humans become deaf,
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.100]   our speech starts to deteriorate without any kind of therapy.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.060]   If a non-human primate or, you know, or let's say a chicken
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.500]   becomes deaf, their vocalizations don't deteriorate,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.460]   very little at least.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.980]   Well, this happens in the vocal learning birds.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.900]   So there were all these behavioral parallels
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.620]   that came along in a package.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.020]   And then people looked into the brain.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.580]   Fernando Nadama, my former PhD advisor,
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.380]   and began to discover the area X you talked about,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.980]   the robust nucleus of the archipelion.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.100]   And these brain pathways were not found
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.460]   in the species who couldn't imitate.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.100]   So there was a parallel here.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.540]   And then jumping many years later, you know,
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.500]   I started to dig down into these brain circuits
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.900]   to discover that these brain circuits
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   have parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans,
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.340]   even though they're by a different name
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.980]   like Broca's and laryngomotor cortex.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.020]   And most recently we discovered not only the actual circuitry
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.620]   and the connectivity are similar,
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.300]   but the underlying genes that are expressed
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.980]   in these brain regions in a specialized way,
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.580]   different from the rest of the brain are also similar
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.940]   between humans and songbirds and parrots.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.300]   So all the way down to the genes,
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.420]   and now we're finding the specific mutations
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.020]   are also similar, not always identical, but similar,
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.180]   which indicates remarkable convergence
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.140]   for so-called complex behavior in species
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.020]   separated by 300 million years from the common ancestor.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.540]   And not only that, we are discovering
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.460]   that mutations in these genes
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.260]   that cause speech deficits in humans, like in FOXP2.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.340]   If you put those same mutations
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.180]   or similar type of deficits in these vocal learning birds,
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.860]   you get similar deficits.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.900]   So convergence of the behavior is associated
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.740]   with similar genetic disorders of the behavior.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.020]   - Incredible.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.140]   I have to ask, do hummingbirds sing or do they hum?
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.060]   - Hummingbirds hum with their wings
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.900]   and sing with their syrinx.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.220]   - In a coordinated way?
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.660]   - In a coordinated way.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.500]   There is some species of hummingbirds
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.540]   that actually will, Doug Ashworth showed this,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.700]   that will flap their wings and create a slapping sound
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.380]   with their wings that's in unison with their song.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.300]   And you would not know it,
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.620]   but it sounds like a particular syllable in their songs,
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.420]   even though it's their wings
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.180]   and their voice at the same time.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.580]   - Hummingbirds are clapping to their song.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.340]   - Clapping, they're snapping their wings together
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.940]   in unison with a song to make it like,
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.140]   if I'm going, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.860]   You know, and I banged on the table.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.500]   Except they make it almost sound
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.140]   like their voice with their wings.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.100]   - Incredible.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.660]   - Yes.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.500]   And they got some of the smallest brains around.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.420]   - I guess as the kids would say, mind blown.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.260]   - Yes, yes.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.100]   - Incredible.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.940]   - Yes.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.780]   - Incredible, I love hummingbirds
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.180]   and I always feel like it's such a special thing
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.500]   to get a moment to see one because they move around so fast
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.100]   and they flit away so fast in these ballistic trajectories
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.700]   that when you get to see one stationary for a moment
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.860]   or even just hovering there,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.380]   you feel like you're extracting so much
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.140]   from their little microcosm of life.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.700]   But now I realize they're playing music essentially.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.540]   - Right, exactly.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.020]   And what's amazing about hummingbirds,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.340]   and we're going to say vocal learning species in general,
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.220]   is that for whatever reason,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.860]   they seem to evolve multiple complex traits.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.860]   You know, this idea that the evolving language,
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.820]   spoken language in particular,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.740]   comes along with a set of specializations.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.300]   - Incredible.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.620]   When I was coming up in neuroscience,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.540]   I learned that, I think it was the work of Peter Marler,
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.540]   that young birds learn, songbirds learn their tutor's song
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.300]   and learn it quite well,
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.500]   but that they could learn the song of another tutor.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.180]   In other words, they could learn a different,
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.860]   and for the listeners, I'm doing air quotes here,
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.620]   a different language, a different bird song,
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.580]   different than their own species song,
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.660]   but never as well as they could learn
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.660]   their own natural, genetically linked song.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.300]   Genetically linked, meaning that,
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.860]   it would be like me being raised in a different culture
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.900]   and that I would learn the other language,
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.700]   but not as well as I would have learned English.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.060]   This is the idea.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.900]   Is that true?
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.860]   - That is true, yes.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.180]   And that's what I learned growing up as well
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.540]   and talked to Peter Marler himself about before he passed.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.500]   He used to call it the innate predisposition to learn.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.900]   All right, so, which would be kind of the equivalent
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.420]   in the linguistic community of universal grammar.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:21.220]   There is something genetically influencing
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.500]   our vocal communication on top of what we learn culturally.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.840]   And so there's this balance between the genetic control
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.420]   of speech or a song in these birds
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.380]   and the learned cultural control.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.280]   And so, yes, if you were to take,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.580]   I mean, in this case, we actually tried this
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.740]   at Rockefeller later on, take a zebra finch
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.260]   and raise it with a canary, it would sing a song
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.900]   that was sort of like a hybrid in between.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.900]   We call it a keninch, right?
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.460]   (laughing)
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.260]   And vice versa for the canary,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.340]   because there's something different
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.580]   about their vocal musculature or the circuitry in the brain.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.760]   And with a zebra finch, even with a closely related species,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.320]   if you would take a zebra finch, a young animal,
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.840]   and in one cage next to it,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.140]   place its own species, adult male, right?
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.500]   And in the other cage, place a Bengalese finch next to it,
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.700]   it would preferably learn the song
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.420]   from its own species' neighbor.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.180]   But if you remove its neighbor,
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.920]   it would learn that Bengalese finch very well.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.760]   - Fantastic.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.020]   - And it has something to do with also the social bonding
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.420]   with your own species.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.620]   - Incredible.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.500]   That raises a question that I,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.880]   based on something I also heard,
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.280]   but I don't have any scientific,
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.000]   peer-reviewed publication to point to,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.520]   which is this idea of pidgin, not the bird,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.820]   but this idea of when multiple cultures and languages
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.720]   converge in a given geographic area,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.460]   that the children of all the different native languages
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.260]   will come up with their own language.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.780]   I think this was in island culture, maybe in Hawaii,
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.100]   called pidgin, which is sort of a hybrid
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.380]   of the various languages that their parents speak at home
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.380]   and that they themselves speak.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.600]   And that somehow pidgin, again, not the bird,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.400]   but a language called pidgin for reasons I don't know,
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.660]   harbors certain basic elements of all language.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.820]   Is that true?
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.660]   Is that not true?
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.420]   - I haven't studied enough myself
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.520]   in terms of pidgin specifically,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.160]   but in terms of cultural evolution of language
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.560]   and hybridization between different cultures and so forth,
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   even amongst birds with different dialects,
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.080]   and you bring them together,
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.960]   what is going on here is cultural evolution
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.180]   remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.740]   So if you bring people from two separate populations
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.360]   together that have been in their separate populations
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   evolutionarily, at least, for hundreds of generations,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.560]   so someone's speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English,
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.260]   and that child then is learning from both of them,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.700]   yes, that child's gonna be able to pick up
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   and merge phonemes and words together
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.560]   in a way that an adult wouldn't,
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.740]   because why they're experiencing both languages
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.060]   at the same time during their critical period years
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.780]   in a way that adults would not be able to experience.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.620]   And so you get a hybrid.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.640]   And the lowest common denominator
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.420]   is gonna be what they share.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.860]   And so the phonemes that they've retained
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.860]   in each of their languages is what's gonna be,
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.620]   I imagine, used the most.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.220]   - Interesting.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:40.140]   So we've got brain circuits in songbirds and in humans
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.780]   that in many ways are similar,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.780]   perhaps not in their exact wiring,
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.940]   but in their basic contour of wiring,
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.460]   and genes that are expressed in both sets of neural circuits
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.260]   in very distinct species that are responsible
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.900]   for these phenomenon we're calling speech and language.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.580]   What sorts of things are those genes controlling?
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.400]   I could imagine they were controlling the wiring
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.300]   of connections between brain areas,
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.860]   essentially a map of a circuit,
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.740]   basically like an engineer would design a circuit
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.620]   for speech and language,
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.840]   nature designed the circuit for speech and language,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.820]   but presumably other things too,
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.820]   like the ability to connect motor patterns
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.600]   within the throat, of muscles within the throat,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.020]   when the control of the tongue.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.780]   I mean, what are these genes doing?
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.900]   - You're pretty good.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.820]   Yeah, you've made some very good guesses there
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.120]   that make sense.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.840]   So yes, one of the things that differ
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.340]   in the speech pathways of us
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.820]   and these song pathways of birds
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.480]   is some of the connections are fundamentally different
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.100]   than the surrounding circuits.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.960]   Like a direct cortical connection
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.300]   from the areas that control vocalizations in the cortex
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.540]   to the motor neurons that control the larynx in humans
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.900]   or the syrinx in birds.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.660]   And so we've actually made a prediction
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.140]   that since some of these connections differ,
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.460]   we're gonna find genes that control neural connectivity
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.900]   and that specialize in that function that differ.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.660]   And that's exactly what we found.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.580]   Genes that control what we call axon guidance
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.900]   and form-instant connections.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.100]   And what was interesting,
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.000]   it was sort of in the opposite direction that we expected.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.620]   That is, some of these genes,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.100]   actually a number of them that control neural connectivity
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.860]   were turned off in the speech circuit, all right?
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.460]   And it didn't make sense to us at first
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.820]   and so we started to realize the function of these genes
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.540]   are to repel connections from forming.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.460]   So repulsive molecules.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.620]   And so when you turn them off,
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.300]   they allow certain connections to form
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.260]   that normally would have not formed.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.940]   So by turning them off,
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.520]   you gotta gain a function for speech, all right?
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.740]   Other genes that surprised us
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.060]   were genes involved in calcium buffering, neural protection.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.720]   Like a parvalvumine or a heat shock protein.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.740]   So when your brain gets hot, these proteins turn on.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.340]   And we couldn't figure out for a long time
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.020]   why is that the case?
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.660]   And then the idea popped to me one day and said,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.140]   ah, when I heard the larynx
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.720]   is the fastest firing muscles in the body, all right?
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.840]   In order to vibrate sound
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.720]   and modulate sound in the way we do,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.600]   you have to control, you have to move those muscles,
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.120]   you know, three to four to five times faster
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.500]   than just regular walking or running.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.940]   And so when you stick electrodes in the brain areas
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.300]   that control learned vocalizations in these birds
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.520]   and I think in humans as well,
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.960]   those neurons are firing at a higher rate
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.800]   to control these muscles.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.980]   And so what is that gonna do?
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.660]   You're gonna have lots of toxicity in those neurons
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.480]   unless you upregulate molecules
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.800]   that take out the extra load
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.000]   that is needed to control the larynx.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.900]   And then finally, a third set of genes
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.280]   that are specialized in these speech circuit
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.940]   are involved in neuroplasticity.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.620]   Neuroplasticity meaning allowing the brain circuits
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.540]   to be more flexible so you can learn better.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.860]   And why is that?
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.300]   I think learning how to produce speech
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.640]   is a more complex learning ability
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.600]   than say learning how to walk
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.420]   or learning how to do tricks and jumps and so forth
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.760]   that dogs do.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.400]   - Yeah, it's interesting as you say that
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.680]   because I realized that many aspects of speech
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.740]   are sort of reflexive.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.800]   I'm not thinking about each word I'm gonna say,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.120]   they just sort of roll out of my mouth.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.040]   Hopefully with some forethought,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.600]   we both know people that seem to speak,
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.880]   think less, fewer synapses between their brain
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.360]   and their mouth than others, right?
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.760]   A lot of examples out there.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.600]   And some people are very deliberate in their speech,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.440]   but nonetheless, that much of speech has to be precise,
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.000]   and some of it less precise.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.340]   In terms of plasticity of speech
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.680]   and the ability to learn multiple languages,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.680]   but even just one language,
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.880]   what's going on in the critical period,
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.200]   the so-called critical period?
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.960]   Why is it that, so my niece speaks Spanish,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.240]   she's Guatemalan, speaks Spanish and English incredibly well.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.160]   She's 14 years old.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.640]   I've struggled with Spanish my whole life.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.720]   My father's bilingual, my mother is not.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.000]   I've tried to learn Spanish as an adult.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.920]   It's really challenging.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.100]   I'm told that had I learned it when I was eight,
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.200]   I would be better off.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.020]   - That's right.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.680]   - Or it would be installed within me.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.520]   So the first question is,
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.360]   is it easier to learn multiple languages
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.080]   without an accent early in life?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.260]   And if so, why?
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.800]   And then the second question is,
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.560]   if one can already speak more than one language
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.640]   as a consequence of childhood learning,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.940]   is it easier to acquire new languages later on?
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.460]   - So the answer to both of those questions is yes in that,
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:49.020]   but to explain this, I need to let you know,
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.760]   actually the entire brain
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.360]   is undergoing a critical period development,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.340]   not just the speech pathways.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.280]   And so it's easier to learn how to play a piano.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.120]   It's easier to learn how to ride a bike for the first time
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.000]   and so forth as a young child
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.220]   than it is later in life.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.920]   What I mean easier in terms of when you start from,
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   you start from first principles of learning something.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.560]   So the very first time if you're gonna learn Chinese
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.440]   as a child versus the very first time
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.080]   you learn Chinese as an adult,
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.860]   or learning to play piano as a child versus an adult.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:28.320]   But the speech pathways, or let's say speech behavior,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.680]   I think has a stronger critical period change to it
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.280]   than other circuits.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.640]   And why, what's going on there in general?
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.020]   If you, why do you need a critical period
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.960]   to make you more stable,
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.160]   to make you more stubborn, so to speak?
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   The reason I believe is that the brain is not for,
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.560]   brain can only hold so much information.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.400]   And if you are undergoing rapid learning
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.640]   to learn, to acquire new knowledge,
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.760]   you also have to, you know, dump stuff.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.200]   Put memory or information in the trash, like in a computer.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.960]   You only have so many gigabases of memory.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.280]   And so therefore, plus also for survival,
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.640]   you don't wanna keep forgetting things.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.840]   And so the brain is designed, I believe,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.920]   to undergo this critical period
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.400]   and solidify the circuits with what you learned as a child
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.120]   and you use that for the rest of your life.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.000]   And we humans stay even more plastic in our brain functions,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.480]   controlled by a gene called SRGAP2.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.280]   We have an extra copy of it that leaves our speech circuit
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.880]   in other brain regions in a more immature state
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.080]   throughout life compared to other animals.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.720]   So we're more immature.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.760]   We're still juvenile-like compared to other animals.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.600]   - I knew it.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.880]   - But we still go through the critical periods
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.240]   like they all do.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.120]   And now the question you asked about,
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.640]   if you learn more languages as a child,
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.480]   is it easier to learn as an adult?
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.400]   And that's a common finding out there in the literature.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.120]   There are some that argue against it.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.800]   But for those that support it, the idea there is
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.640]   you are born with a set of innate sounds
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.040]   you can produce of phonemes and you narrow that down
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.400]   because not all languages use all of them.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.680]   And so you narrow down the ones you use
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.120]   to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.440]   and you maintain those phonemes as an adult.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.640]   And here comes along another language
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.840]   that's using those phonemes
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.000]   or in different combinations you're not used to.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.480]   And therefore, it's like starting from first principles.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.320]   But if you already have them in multiple languages
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.080]   that you're using, then it makes it easier to use them
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.600]   in another third or fourth language.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.760]   - I see, incredible.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.120]   - So it's not like your brain
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.560]   has maintained greater plasticity.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.440]   Your brain has maintained greater ability
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.520]   to produce different sounds
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.160]   that then allows you to learn another language faster.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.600]   - Got it.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.000]   Are the hand gestures associated with sounds
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.200]   or with meanings of words?
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.920]   - I think the hand gestures are associated
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.440]   with both the sounds and the meaning.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.320]   When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.840]   and you are making a loud screaming noise, right,
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.120]   you may make hand gestures
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.880]   that look like you're gonna beat the wall, right,
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.680]   because you're making loud sounds and loud gestures, right?
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.880]   But if you wanna explain something like come over here,
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.640]   what I just do now to you, for those who can't see me,
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.880]   I swung my hand towards you and swung it here to me,
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.480]   that has a meaning to it, to come here.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.800]   So just like with the voice,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.480]   the hand gestures are producing both,
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.120]   you know, both qualities of sounds.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.880]   - And for people that speak multiple languages,
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.400]   especially those that learn those multiple languages
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.760]   early in development,
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.280]   do they switch their patterns of motor movements
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.600]   according to, let's say, going from Italian to Arabic
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.760]   or from Arabic to French
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.880]   in a way that matches the precision of language
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.960]   that they're speaking?
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.600]   - You know what, you just asked me a question
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.120]   I don't know the answer to.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.400]   I would imagine that would make sense
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.040]   because of switching in terms of,
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.920]   sometimes people might call this code switching,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.400]   even different dialects of the same language.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.560]   Could you do that with your gestures?
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.320]   I imagine so, but I really don't know if that's true or not.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.880]   - I certainly don't know from my own experience
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.480]   because I only speak one language.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.640]   [both laughing]
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.880]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.960]   I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.160]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.440]   Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.880]   is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.960]   that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.680]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.100]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.720]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.640]   and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.560]   is that it supplies total foundational coverage
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.960]   of my vitamin mineral needs
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.880]   and it supplies important nutrients that I need
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.440]   to support my gut microbiome.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.180]   The gut microbiome, as many of you know,
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.280]   supports the immune system.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.320]   It also supports the so-called gut brain axis,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.680]   which is vital for mood, for energy levels,
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.960]   for regulating focus,
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.780]   and many other features of our mental health
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.100]   and physical health that impact our daily performance
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.740]   and high performance in any endeavors
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.120]   we might be involved in.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.520]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.200]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.800]   and claim a special offer.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.460]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.360]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.560]   And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.640]   for all sorts of things like hormone health
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.060]   and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.240]   and calcium regulation.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.460]   Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.860]   to claim that special offer.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.560]   To go a little bit into the abstract, but not too far,
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.440]   what about modes of speech and language
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.040]   that seem to have a depth of emotionality and meaning,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.080]   but for which it departs from structured language?
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.160]   Here's what I mean, poetry.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.140]   I think of musicians, like there are some Bob Dylan songs
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:17.180]   that to me, I understand the individual words.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.240]   I like to think there's an emotion associated with it.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.960]   At least I experienced some sort of emotion
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.660]   and I have a guess about what he was experiencing.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.480]   But if I were to just read it linearly without the music
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.800]   and without him singing it or somebody singing it like him,
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.840]   it wouldn't hold any meaning.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.200]   So in other words, words that seem to have meaning,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.660]   but not associated with language,
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.240]   but somehow tap into an emotionality.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.120]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   So we call this difference semantic communication,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.600]   communication with meaning, and affective communication,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.720]   communication that has more of an emotional feeling
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.300]   content to it, but not with the semantics.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.580]   And the two can be mixed up.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.680]   Like with singing words that have meaning,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.960]   but also have this affective emotional,
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.020]   you just love the sound of the singer that you're hearing.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   And initially, psychologists, scientists in general
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.580]   thought that these were gonna be controlled
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.160]   by different brain circuits.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.760]   And it is the case there are emotional brain centers
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.720]   in the hypothalamus, in the cingulate cortex and so forth
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.060]   that do give tone to the sounds.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.120]   But I believe based upon imaging work
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   and work we see in birds,
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.720]   when birds are communicating semantic information
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.640]   in their sounds, which is not too often, but it happens,
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.520]   versus affective communication,
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.540]   sing because I'm trying to attract the mate,
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.380]   my courtship song or defend my territory,
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.700]   it's the same brain circuits.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.120]   It's the same speech-like or song circuits
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.300]   are being used in different ways.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.220]   - A friend of mine who's also a therapist said to me,
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.900]   it's possible to say I love you with intense hatred
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.500]   and to say I hate you with intense love.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.520]   And reminded me that it's possible to hear
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.080]   both of those statements in either way.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.260]   So I guess it's not just limited to song or poetry.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.680]   It also, there's something about the intention
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.240]   and the emotional context in which something's spoken
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.060]   that it can heavily shape the way
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.280]   that we interpret what we hear.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.120]   - That's right.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.400]   And I consider all of that actually meaning,
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.520]   even though I defined it as, as people commonly do,
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.740]   semantic and affective communication,
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.960]   affective communication to say I hate you
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   but meant love, right, does have emotional meaning to it.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.780]   And so one's more like an object kind of meaning
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.560]   or an abstract kind of meaning.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.600]   There's several other points here I think it's important
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.460]   for those listening out there to hear,
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.220]   is that when I say also this affective
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:07.800]   and semantic communication being used
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.840]   by similar brain circuits,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.320]   it also matters the side of the brain.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   In birds and in humans, there's left-right dominance
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.520]   for learned communication, learned sound communication.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.680]   So the left in us humans is more dominant for speech
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.240]   but the right has a more balance for singing
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.160]   or processing musical sounds
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.840]   as opposed to processing speech.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.800]   Both get used for both reasons.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.600]   And so when people say your right brain
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.160]   is your artistic brain
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.440]   and your left brain is your thinking brain,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.700]   this is what they're referring to.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.220]   And so that's another distinction.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.720]   The second thing that's useful to know
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.300]   is that all vocal learning species use their learned sounds
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.040]   for this emotional affective kind of communication
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.380]   but only a few of them like humans
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.660]   and some parrots and dolphins use it
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.660]   for the semantic kind of communication we're calling speech.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.300]   And that has led a number of people to hypothesize
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.440]   that the evolution of spoken language of speech
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.180]   evolved first for singing,
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:21.380]   for this more like emotional kind of made attraction
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.060]   like the Jennifer Lopez, the Ricky Martin kind of songs
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.480]   and so forth.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.440]   And then later on,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.600]   it became used for abstract communication
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.160]   like we're doing now.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.200]   - Interesting.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.700]   Well, that's a perfect segue for me
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.400]   to be able to ask you about your background
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.700]   and motor control, not only of the hands, but of the body.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.340]   So you have a number of important distinctions to your name
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.100]   but one of them is that you were a member
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.540]   of the Alvin Ailey dance school, school of dance.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.040]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.180]   - So you're an accomplished and quite able dancer, right?
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.860]   Tell us a little bit about your background
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:05.860]   in the world of dance and how it informs your interest
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.200]   in neuroscience, excuse me,
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.960]   and perhaps even how it relates specifically to your work
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.100]   on speech and language.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.500]   - Yes, well, it's interesting.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.300]   And then this kind of history even goes before my time.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.900]   So in my family, my mother and father's side,
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.740]   they both went to the high school of music and art
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.580]   here in New York City.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.220]   And particularly my mother's family,
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.340]   going back multiple generations, they were singers.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.340]   And I even did my family genealogy
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.880]   and found out not only we have some relationships
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.460]   to some well-known singers,
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.780]   distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.060]   but going back to the plantations in North Carolina
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.800]   and so forth, my ancestors were singers in the church
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.000]   for the towns and so forth.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.260]   And this somehow got passed on multiple generations
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.700]   to my family and I thought I was gonna grow up
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.440]   and be a famous singer, right?
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.840]   And me and my brothers and sister formed a band
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.680]   when we were kids and so forth.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.620]   But it turned out that I didn't inherit
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.620]   the singing talents of some of my other family members,
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:12.020]   even though it was okay, but not like my brother,
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:16.160]   not like my mother or my aunts and my cousin, Pudafe,
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.000]   who's now a talented Native American singer.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And so that then influenced me to do other things.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.380]   And I started competing in dance contests.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.580]   Actually, this is around the time of the Saturday Night Fever
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:38.380]   and I was a teenager and I started winning dance contests
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.060]   and I thought, oh, I can dance.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.860]   And I auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.420]   and I got in here in New York City
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.120]   and got into ballet dance and got in, right?
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.860]   And thought if I learn ballet, I can learn everything else.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.000]   It was that idea, if you learn something classical,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.660]   it can teach you for everything else.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.340]   And I was, yeah, at Alvin Ailey Dance School,
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.080]   Joffrey Ballet Dance School,
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.480]   and at the end of my senior concert,
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.340]   I had this opportunity to audition
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.380]   for the Alvin Ailey Dance Company
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.120]   and I had an opportunity to go to college.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.320]   And I also fell in love with another passion
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.880]   that my father had, which was science.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.560]   And so I liked science in high school
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.860]   and I found an overlap also between the arts and sciences.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.900]   Both required creativity, hard work, discipline,
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.740]   new discovery, both weren't boring to me.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.840]   And the one decision I made at that senior dance concert
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.780]   was in talking to the Alvin Ailey recruiter
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.420]   and thinking about it, I have to make a decision.
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.780]   And I thought something my mother taught me
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:46.120]   because she was growing up in the 1960s cultural revolution,
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.960]   do something that has a positive impact on society.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.360]   And I thought that I can do that better
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.420]   as a dancer than a scientist.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.860]   So now jump, I get into college, undergraduate school,
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.160]   I major in molecular biology and mathematics,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.140]   I decided I wanted to be a biologist,
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.880]   got into graduate school, wanted to study the brain
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.480]   at the Rockefeller University,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.880]   so I went from Hunter College to Rockefeller University.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.280]   And so now I got to the brain
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.180]   and why did I choose the brain?
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.420]   Is because it controls dancing.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.120]   But I didn't, there wasn't anybody studying dancing.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.660]   And I wanted to study the brain, something that it does
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.100]   that's really interesting and complex.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.600]   And I thought, ah, language is what it does.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.760]   You couldn't study that in mice,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.800]   you couldn't study in non-human primates,
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.560]   but these birds do this wonderful thing
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.840]   that Fernando Nadebaum was studying at Rockefeller.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   And so that's what got me into the birds.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   And then jumping now 15 years later,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.780]   yeah, that's right, even after I'm into
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.880]   now having my own lab studying vocal learning
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.560]   in these birds as a model for language in humans,
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.560]   it turns out that Ani Patel and others have discovered
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:04.600]   that only vocal learning species can learn how to dance.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.500]   - Is that right?
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.640]   - That's right, yes.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.040]   - So I've seen these, I'm just scrolling through
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.280]   the files here in my mind.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.040]   I think about every once in a while someone will,
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.380]   I loved parrots.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.880]   Every once in a while someone will send me
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.220]   one of these little Instagram or Twitter videos
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.620]   of a parrot doing what looks to me like dance.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.760]   Typically it's a cockatoo.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.920]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.080]   - Even foot stomping to the sound.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.660]   - Famous one called snowball out there,
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.460]   but there are many snowballs out there.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.800]   - They're all, all the dancing birds are named snowball.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.060]   That's interesting tactic.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:40.160]   So only animals with language dance.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.800]   - Yeah, vocal learning in particular,
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.700]   the ability to imitate sounds, yes.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.540]   - Incredible.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.680]   - Yes, and this now is bringing my life full circle, all right?
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.080]   And I, and so when that was discovered in 2009,
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.880]   at that same time in my lab at Duke,
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.120]   we had discovered that vocal learning brain pathways
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.020]   in songbirds as well as in humans and in parrots, right,
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.520]   like snowball, are embedded within circuits
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.260]   that control learning how to move.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.640]   And that led us to a theory called the brain pathway
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.240]   or motor theory of vocal learning origin,
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.300]   where the brain pathways for vocal learning and speech
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.440]   evolved by a whole duplication
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.920]   of the surrounding motor circuits
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.620]   involving learning how to move.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.720]   Now, how does that explain dance, right?
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.260]   Well, when snowball, the cockatoos are dancing,
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.660]   they're using the brain regions
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.500]   around their speech-like circuits
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.760]   to do this dancing behavior.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.320]   And so what's going on there?
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.500]   What we hypothesize and now like to test
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:51.500]   is that when speech evolved in humans
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.240]   and the equivalent behavior in parrots and songbirds,
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.980]   it required a very tight integration
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.880]   in the brain regions that can hear sound
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.460]   with the brain regions that control your muscles
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.260]   from moving your larynx and tongue and so forth
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.060]   for producing sound.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.860]   And that tight auditory motor integration,
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:16.260]   we argue then contaminated the surrounding brain regions.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.760]   And that contamination of the surrounding brain regions
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.740]   now allows us humans in particular in parrots
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.340]   to coordinate our muscle movements of the rest of the body
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.680]   with sound in the same way we do for speech sounds.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.540]   Well, so we're speaking with our bodies when we dance.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.380]   - Incredible, and I have to say that as poor as I am
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.120]   at speaking multiple languages, I'm even worse at dancing.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.020]   So-- - But I guarantee
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.220]   you're better than a monkey.
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.920]   - But not Snowball the Cockatoo.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.560]   - Maybe not Snowball.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.860]   On YouTube, we have a video where there's some scientists
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.420]   dancing with Snowball, and you'll see Snowball's
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.000]   doing better than some of the scientists.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.540]   - Okay, well, as long as I'm not the worst
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.140]   of all scientists at dancing,
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:00.540]   there's always neuroplasticity.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.100]   May it save me someday.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:07.540]   You said something incredible that I completely believe,
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:10.680]   even though I have minimum to,
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.920]   let's just say minimum dancing ability.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.640]   I can get by at a party or wedding
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.280]   without complete embarrassment,
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.920]   but I don't have any structured training.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:25.040]   So the body clearly can communicate with movement.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.680]   As a trained dancer and knowing other trained dancers,
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.840]   I always think of dance and bodily movement
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.600]   and communication through bodily movement
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.240]   as a form of wordlessness, like a state of wordlessness.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.140]   In fact, the few times when I think that
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.820]   maybe I'm actually dancing modestly well
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.520]   for the context that I'm in,
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.980]   where I see other people dancing
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.400]   and they seem to just be very much in the movement,
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   it's almost like a state of non-language,
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.720]   non-spoken language.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.940]   And yet what you're telling me is that
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.700]   there's a direct bridge at some level
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.680]   between the movement of the body and language.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.560]   So is there a language of the body
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.040]   that is distinct from the language of speech?
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.800]   And if so, or if not, how do those map onto one another?
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.480]   What does that Venn diagram look like?
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:22.400]   So let me define first dance in this context
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.600]   of vocal learning species.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.400]   This is the kind of dancing that we are specialized in doing
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   and the vocal learning species are specialized in doing
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.560]   is synchronizing body movements of muscles
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.040]   to the rhythmic beats of music.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.560]   And for some reason, we like doing that.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.520]   We like synchronizing to sound
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.400]   and doing it together as a group of people.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.120]   And that kind of communication amongst ourselves
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.800]   is more like the effective kind of communication
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.900]   I mentioned earlier, unlike the semantic kind.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.140]   So we humans are using our voices
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:02.440]   more for the semantic abstract communication,
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.620]   but we're using learn dance for the effective,
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.200]   emotional bonding kind of communication.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.240]   It doesn't mean we can't communicate semantic information
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.640]   in dance and we do it, but it's not as popular.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.180]   Like a ballet in the Nutcracker, it is popular
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:26.000]   where they are communicating, the Arabian guy comes out,
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.180]   which I was the Arabian guy in the ballet Nutcracker,
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:29.160]   that's how I remember.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.760]   Yeah, for the Westchester Ballet Company
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:35.720]   when I was a teenager, we're trying to communicate meaning
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.080]   in our ballet dance and it can go on with a whole story
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.960]   and so forth, but people don't interpret that
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.000]   as clearly as speech.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.200]   They're seeing the ballet with semantic communication
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.580]   with a lot of emotional content.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.300]   Whereas you go out to a club,
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:55.180]   you're not communicating, okay, how are you feeling today?
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.320]   Tell me about your day and so forth.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.960]   You're trying to synchronize with other people
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.360]   in an effective way.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   And I think that's because the dance brain circuit
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.080]   inherited the more ancient part of the speech circuit,
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.160]   which was for singing.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.200]   - I always had the feeling that with certain forms of music,
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.000]   in particular opera, but any kind of music
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.320]   where there are some long notes sung,
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   that at some level there was a literal resonance created
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.980]   between the singer and the listener that,
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.940]   or I think of like the deep voice of a Johnny Cash
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.820]   or where at some level you can almost feel the voice
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.360]   in your own body.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.240]   And in theory, that could be the vibration
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.100]   or the firing of the phrenic nerve controlling the diaphragm
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.120]   for all I know.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   Is there any evidence that there's a coordination
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.440]   between performer and audience
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.140]   at the level of mind and body?
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:02.740]   - I'm gonna say possibly yes.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.860]   And the reason why is because I just came back
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.580]   from a conference on the neurobiology of dance.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.860]   - Clearly I'm going to the wrong meetings.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.380]   Vision science can be so boring.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.180]   - Yes, one of my colleagues, Tukumseh Fitch
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.900]   and Jonathan Fritz, they organized a particular section
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.340]   on this conference in Virginia.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.460]   And this is the first time I was in the room
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.080]   with so many neuroscientists studying
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.340]   the neurobiology of dance.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.140]   It's a new field now in the last five years.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:37.140]   And there was one lab where they were putting EEG electrodes
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:42.820]   on the dancers, on two different dancers partnering
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:47.820]   with each other, as well as the audience seeing the dance.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.980]   And some argued, okay, if you're listening to the music
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.180]   as well, how are you responding?
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.820]   Because you're asking a question about music
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.100]   and I'm giving you an answer about dance.
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.340]   And what they found is that the dancers,
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.700]   when they resonated with each other during the dance
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.820]   or the audience listening to the dancers and the music,
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.740]   there's some resonance going on there
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.140]   that they've score as higher resonance.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.500]   Their brain activity with these wireless EEG signals
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.100]   are showing something different.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.100]   And so that's why I say possibly yes.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:25.100]   It needs more rigorous study and this is some stuff
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.500]   they published, but it's not prime time yet,
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   but they're trying to figure this out.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.380]   - Love it, so at least if I can't dance well,
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.740]   maybe I can hear and feel what it is to dance
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.700]   in a certain way.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.740]   - That's right.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.700]   And this will be, some people will think that they,
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.380]   even songs that they hear and they can almost sing
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.820]   to themselves in their own head and they know
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.700]   what they want it to sound like.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.660]   They know what it really sounds good, what it sounds like,
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.580]   but they can't get their voice to do it.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.380]   - I'm raising, for those listening, I'm raising my hand.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.220]   No musical ability.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.380]   Others in my household have tremendous musical ability
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.260]   with instruments and with voice, but not me.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:11.260]   - Yeah, and so this is one of my selfish goals
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:16.020]   of trying to find the genetics of why can some people
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.260]   sing really well and some not?
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.860]   Is there some genetic predisposition to that?
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.860]   And then can I modify my own muscles or brain circuits
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.700]   to sing better?
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.180]   - You're still after the singing.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.380]   I guess this is what happens when siblings
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:32.340]   are very in proficiency is that that competitiveness
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.900]   amongst brothers and sisters never goes away.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.900]   - I've been trying to be as good as my brother,
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.460]   Mark and Victor, for the rest of my entire life.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.380]   - Watch out, Mark and Victor, he's coming for you
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.140]   with neuroscience to back him.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:49.180]   Earlier you said that you discovered that you could dance.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.500]   That caught my ear.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.100]   It sounds like you didn't actually have to,
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.020]   I'm not suggesting you didn't work hard at it,
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.700]   but that at the moment where you discovered it,
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.420]   it just sort of was a skill that you had
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.340]   that up until that point, you didn't target a life
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.260]   in the world of dance.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.820]   But the fact that you "discovered" that you could dance
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.060]   really well and then went to this incredible school of dance
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.420]   and did well tells me that perhaps there is an ability
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.460]   that was built up in childhood and/or that perhaps
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.740]   we do all have different genetic leanings
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.940]   for different motor functions.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.300]   - Yeah, well, for me, both explanations could be possible.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.700]   For the first, I grew up in a family listening
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   to Motown songs, dancing at parties and so forth,
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.540]   family parties, an African-American family basically.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:46.540]   And so I grew up dancing from a young child.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:53.300]   But this discovery, maybe dancing even more so,
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:58.700]   in terms of a talent, the genetic component,
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.660]   if it really exists, I don't know.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.740]   You know, with my 23andMe results,
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.820]   it says I have the genetic substitutions
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:11.460]   that are associated with high-intensity athletes
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.180]   and fast-twitch muscles.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.620]   And who knows, maybe that could have something to do
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.820]   with me being able to synchronize my body
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:25.420]   to rhythmic sounds, maybe, maybe better than some others.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:28.900]   It turns out that my genetics also show
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.020]   that I have a genetic substitute that does it,
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.660]   that makes it hard for me to sing on pitch.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.100]   And so that does correlate with my, you know,
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.300]   even though I can sing on this pitch,
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.700]   especially if I hear a piano or, you know, kind of playing it
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.780]   but, you know, maybe that's why my siblings, you know,
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.140]   who didn't have that genetic predisposition
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.700]   in his 23andMe results, you know,
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.740]   could go along with the genetic component as well.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.780]   - I'm imagining family gatherings with 23andMe data
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:59.620]   and intense arguments about it, innate and learned ability.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.300]   - Yes. - Fun.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.980]   Love to be an attendant.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.020]   I'm not inviting myself to your Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.300]   by the way, but I suppose I am.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.140]   - You're welcome to.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.260]   - Thank you.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.540]   I'll bring my 23andMe data.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.700]   I'd love to chat a moment about facial expression
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.180]   because that's a form of motor pattern that, you know,
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.360]   I think for most people out there,
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.360]   just think about smiling and frowning,
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.460]   but there are of course, you know, thousands,
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.460]   if not millions of micro expressions
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.000]   and things of that sort, many of which are subconscious.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.680]   And we're all familiar with the fact that
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.440]   when what somebody says doesn't match some specific feature
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.520]   of their facial expression, that it can call, you know,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.220]   that mismatch can cue our attention,
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.920]   especially among people that know each other very well.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.440]   Like somebody will say, well, you said that,
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.560]   but your right eye twitched to the, you know,
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.360]   a little bit in a way that tells me
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.680]   that you didn't really mean that, these kinds of things.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.800]   Or when, in the opposite example,
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.040]   when the emotionality and the content of our speech
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.200]   is matched to a facial expression,
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.220]   there's something that's just so wonderful about that
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.000]   because it seems like everything's aligned.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:13.840]   - Yeah.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.240]   - So how does the motor circuitry
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.320]   that controls facial expression map onto the brain circuits
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.960]   that control language, speech,
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.320]   and even bodily and hand movements?
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.100]   - Yeah, you ask a great question
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.020]   because we both know some colleagues
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.600]   like Munrich Freiwald at Rockefeller University
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.780]   who studied facial expression and the neurology behind it.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.520]   And now we both share some students that were co-mentoring
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.280]   and talk about this same question that you brought up.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.200]   And what I'm learning a lot is that non-human primates
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.720]   have a lot of diversity in their facial expression
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.120]   like we humans do.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.160]   And what we know about the neurobiology
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.620]   of brain regions controlling those muscles of the face
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.240]   is that these non-human primates and some other species
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.720]   that don't learn how to imitate vocalizations,
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   they have strong connections from the cortical regions
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.360]   to the motor neurons that control facial expressions,
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.420]   but absent connections or weak connections
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.760]   to the motor neurons that control the voice.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.920]   So I think our diverse facial expression,
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.040]   even though it's more diverse than these non-human primates,
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.680]   there was already a preexisting diversity of communication,
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.080]   whether it's intentional or unconscious
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.400]   through facial expression in our ancestors.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.760]   And on top of that, we humans now add the voice
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.120]   along with those facial expressions.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.760]   - I see.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.800]   And in terms of language learning when we're kids,
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.220]   I mean, children fortunately are not told
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.040]   to fake their expressions or to smile
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.480]   when they say I'm happy.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.960]   So at some point, everybody learns for better or for worse
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.260]   how to untangle these different components
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:00.280]   of hand movement, body posture, speech,
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   and facial expression, but in their best form, I would say,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.440]   assuming that the best form is always,
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.040]   I guess there are instances where, for safety reasons,
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.920]   one might need to feign some of these aspects of language.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.740]   But in most cases, when those are aligned,
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.040]   it seems like that could reflect
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.720]   that all the different circuitries
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.340]   are operating in parallel,
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.480]   but that the ability to misalign these
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.920]   is also a powerful aspect to our maturation.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.860]   I even think of theater, for instance,
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:36.740]   where deliberate disentangling of these areas is important,
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:41.000]   but also we know when an actor, when it feels real,
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.500]   and when bad acting is oftentimes
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.480]   when the facial expression or body posture
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.780]   just doesn't quite match what we're hearing.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:53.260]   So are these skills that people that learn and acquire
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.220]   according to adaptability and profession,
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.580]   or do you think that all children and all adults
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:00.560]   eventually learn how to couple and uncouple
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.460]   these circuits a little bit?
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.240]   - Yeah, I think it's this similar argument
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.480]   I mentioned earlier about the innate
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.680]   and the learned for the vocalizations.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.720]   And by the way, when I say we humans have facial expressions
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.640]   associated with our vocalizations
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.040]   in a different way than primates, non-human primates,
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.600]   it's the learned vocalizations I'm talking about.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.680]   So there is a common view out there
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.440]   that facial expressions in non-human species,
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.240]   like non-human primates, or you can have them in birds too,
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.460]   are innate, all right?
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.240]   And so they're reflexive controlled.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.080]   I don't believe that.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.880]   I think there's some learned component to it,
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.880]   and I think we have more learning component to it as well,
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   but we also have an innate component.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.020]   And so if you try to put your hands behind your back
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.920]   and hold your fists, or even just not,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.440]   and try to speak and try to communicate,
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.760]   it's actually harder to do.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.920]   You have to force yourself or put it by your side.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.360]   This comes naturally.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.880]   Facial expressions comes naturally
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.840]   because there is an innate component.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.320]   And yes, you have to learn how to dissociate the two,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.380]   communicate something angry with your hands
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:13.380]   or with your face, but politely with your voice.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.320]   It's very hard to separate at those two
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.320]   because there is that innate component
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.760]   that brings them together.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.400]   So it's like an email too.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.680]   You're emailing and someone says something by email.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.460]   Someone can interpret that angrily or gently,
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.680]   and it becomes ambiguous.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.640]   The facial expressions get rid of that ambiguity.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.040]   - I'm so glad you brought that out
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.320]   because my next question was and is about written language.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.120]   The first question I'll ask is when you write,
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.780]   either type or write things out by hand,
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   do you hear the content of what you want to write
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.580]   in your head, just you personally?
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.760]   - Yes, I do.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.580]   Yeah, and I know that I do
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.520]   because I was trying to figure out a debate about this issue
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.040]   and trying to resolve the debate
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.120]   with my own self-experimentation on me.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.720]   - I ask that because a quite well-known colleague of ours,
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.940]   Carl Deisseroth at Stanford, who's been on this podcast
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.220]   and is of optogenetics fame and psychiatry fame, et cetera.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.060]   - I know him.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.680]   - Yeah, he sends his regards.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.680]   - Yeah, and told me that his practice for writing
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:32.300]   and for thinking involves a quite painful process
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:36.200]   of forcing himself to sit completely still
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.360]   and think in complete sentences,
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.300]   to force thinking in complete sentences.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.800]   And when he told me that, I decided to try this exercise
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.920]   and it's quite difficult.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.400]   First of all, it's difficult for the reason
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.340]   that you mentioned, which is that with many thoughts,
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.440]   I want to look around
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.120]   and I start to gesticulate with my hands.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.040]   So there it is again,
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.660]   the connection between language and hand movement,
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.100]   even if one isn't speaking.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:01.480]   And the other part that's challenging
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.160]   is I realized that while we write in complete sentences,
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.200]   most of the time, we'll talk about how that's changing now
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.160]   and texting, et cetera,
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.600]   that we don't often think in complete sentences
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.760]   and specifically in simple declarative sentences,
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.740]   that a lot of our thoughts would be,
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.320]   if they were written out onto a page,
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.320]   would look pretty much like passive language
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.360]   that a good copy editor or a good editor would say,
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.940]   oh, like we need to cross this out,
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.620]   make this simple and declarative.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.920]   So what I'm getting at here is what is the process
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   of going from a thought to language to written word?
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.920]   And I also wanted to touch on handwritten versus typed,
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.680]   but thought to language to written word,
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.720]   what's going on there?
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.120]   What do we know about the neural circuitry?
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.500]   And I was gonna ask, why is it so hard?
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.800]   But now I want to ask, why is this even possible?
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.640]   It seems like a very challenging
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.280]   neural computational problem.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.880]   And coming from the linguistic world
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.120]   and even just the regular neurobiology world,
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.640]   going back to something I said before
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.560]   is about a separate language module in the brain.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.760]   There was this thought or hypothesis
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.600]   that this language module
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.740]   has all these complex algorithms to them
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.520]   and they're signaling to the speech circuit,
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.480]   how to produce the sounds,
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.280]   the hand circuit, how to write them or gesture,
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.400]   the visual pathway on how to interpret them from reading
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.360]   and the auditory pathway for listening.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.960]   I don't think that's the case, all right?
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.200]   And that this thinking
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.920]   where there's this internal speech going on,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.640]   what I think is going on is to explain
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.040]   what you're asking is about,
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.520]   that I'm gonna take it from the perspective
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.720]   of reading something.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.840]   You read something on a paper,
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.800]   the signal from the paper goes through your eyes,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.120]   it goes to the back of your brain
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.520]   to your visual cortical regions eventually,
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.120]   and then you now got to interpret that signal
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.160]   in your visual pathway of what you're reading.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.320]   How are you gonna do that internal speech?
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.760]   That visual signal then goes to your speech pathway
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.840]   in the motor cortex in front here in Broca's area
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.560]   and you silently speak what you read in your brain
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.400]   without moving your muscles.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.160]   And sometimes actually if you put electrodes,
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.040]   EMG electrodes on your laryngeal muscles,
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.640]   even on birds you can do this,
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.960]   you'll see activity there while reading
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.480]   or trying to speak silently
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.600]   even though no sound's coming out.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.120]   And so your speech pathway
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.760]   is now speaking what you're reading.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   Now to finish it off,
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.840]   that signal is sent to your auditory pathway
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.320]   so you can hear what you're speaking in your own head.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.160]   - That's incredible.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.160]   - And this is why it's complicated
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.200]   because you're using like three different pathways,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.640]   the visual, the speaking motor one and the auditory
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.920]   to read, oh, and then you got to write, right?
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.720]   Okay, here comes the fourth one.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.520]   Now the hand areas next to your speech pathway
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.320]   has got to take that auditory signal
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.200]   or even the adjacent motor signals for speaking
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.400]   and translate it into a visual signal on paper.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.360]   So you're using at least four brain circuits
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.560]   which includes the speech production
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.480]   and the speech perception pathways to write.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.640]   - Incredible.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.120]   And finally explains to me why,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.800]   so I was weaned teaching undergraduates,
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.280]   graduate students and medical students
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.640]   and I've observed that when I'm teaching
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.080]   I have to stop speaking
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.360]   if I'm going to write something on the board.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.000]   I just have to stop all speaking completely.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.200]   Turns out this is an advantage to catch
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.440]   because it allows me to catch my voice,
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.960]   it allows me to slow down a bit,
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.520]   breathe and inhale some oxygen and so on
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.760]   because I tend to speak quickly
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.920]   if I'm not writing something out.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.120]   So there's a break in the circuitry for me
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.720]   or at least they are distinct enough
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.560]   that I have to stop and then write something.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.440]   - Yes, that does imply competing brain circuits
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.920]   for your conscious attention.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.960]   - We have colleagues up at Columbia Med
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.040]   who are known at least in our circles
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.640]   for voice dictating their papers, not writing them out
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.280]   but just speaking into a voice recorder.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.760]   I've written papers that way.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.480]   It doesn't feel quite as natural for me
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.920]   as writing things out
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.800]   but not because I can go quickly
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.920]   from thought to language to typing.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.360]   I type reasonably fast, I can touch type now.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.600]   I don't think I ever taught my, I think I taught myself.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.200]   I never took a touch type course
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.400]   but it just sort of happened now.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.360]   My motor system seems to know where the keys are
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.320]   with enough accuracy that it works.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.280]   This is remarkable to me that any of us can do this
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.320]   but when it comes to writing,
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.960]   what I've found is that if my rate of thought
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:07.040]   and my rate of writing are aligned nicely, things go well.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.380]   However, if I'm thinking much faster than I can write,
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.720]   that's a problem.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.160]   And certainly if I'm thinking more slowly
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.920]   than I want to write, that's also a problem.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.460]   And the solution for me has been to write with a pen.
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.520]   I'm in love with these
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.480]   and I have no relationship to the company,
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.400]   at least not now, although if they want to come,
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.840]   if they want to work with us, I love these Pilot V5, V7s
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.600]   because not necessarily because of the ink or the feel,
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600]   although I like that as well
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.240]   but because of the rate that allows me to write.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.520]   They write very well slowly and they write very well quickly.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.760]   And so I have this theory supported only
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.280]   by my own ANIC data, no peer-reviewed study,
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.280]   that writing by hand is fundamentally different
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.760]   than typing out information.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.760]   Is there any evidence that this motor pathway for writing
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.420]   is better or somehow different
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.960]   than the motor pathway for typing?
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.440]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.760]   And I don't know of any studies,
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.520]   I have my own personal experience as well,
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.280]   but trying to put this into the context,
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.280]   if I had to design an experiment to test the hypothesis here
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.720]   to explain your experience in mind
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.720]   is that writing by hand, I would argue,
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.120]   requires a different set of less skills
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.100]   with the fingers than typing.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.740]   So you have to coordinate your fingers
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:42.740]   more in opposite directions and so forth with typing
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.460]   but also writing by hand requires more arm movement.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:51.320]   And so therefore, I would argue that the difficulty there
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:57.480]   could be in the types of muscles
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.180]   and the fine motor control you need of those muscles
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.520]   along with speaking in your brain at the same time.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.400]   - So basically I'm coarse, I'm a brute
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.320]   and so it makes sense
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.980]   that a more primitive writing device would work.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.080]   - That's right, yes.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.080]   But let me add to this in terms of my own personal experience
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:20.000]   what I find is I can write something faster by hand
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.580]   for a short period of time compared to typing
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.780]   and that is because I think I run out of the energy
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:32.800]   in my arm movements faster than I run out of muscle energy
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.520]   in my finger movements.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.520]   And I think it takes a longer time
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.360]   for us to write words with our fingers
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.880]   because in terms of the speech.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.120]   So I think your writing, whether it's by hand or typing
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.760]   and your speech, it only will align very well
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.600]   if you can type as fast as you can speak
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.680]   or write as fast as you can speak in your head.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.500]   - I love it.
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.480]   So what you've done, if I understand correctly,
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.800]   is created a bridge between thought and writing
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   and that bridge is speech.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.120]   - That bridge is speech, that's right.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:07.960]   That's right.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.160]   When you're writing something out,
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.240]   you're speaking it to yourself.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.480]   And if you're speaking faster than you can type,
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   you got a problem.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.620]   - Interesting, I do a number of podcast episodes
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.440]   that are not with guests, but solo episodes.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.760]   And as listeners know, these are very long episodes,
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.660]   often two or more hours.
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.640]   And we joke around the podcast studio
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.600]   that I will get locked into a mode of speech
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.360]   where some of it is more elaborative and anecdotal
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.520]   and then I'll punch out simple declarative sentences.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.120]   I find it very hard to switch from one module to the next.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.840]   The thing that I have done in order to make that transition
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.960]   more fluid and prep for those podcast episodes
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.480]   is actually to read the lyrics of songs
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.740]   and to sing them in my head
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.760]   as a way of warming up my vocal cords.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.340]   But luckily for those around me, when I do that,
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.780]   I'm not actually singing out loud.
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:08.220]   And so what you're telling me supports this idea
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:13.220]   that even when we are imagining singing or writing
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.520]   in our mind, we are exercising our vocal cords.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.820]   - You're actually getting little low potentials
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.800]   of electrical currents reaching your muscles there,
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.240]   which also means you're exercising
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.480]   your speech brain circuits too without actually going
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.940]   with the flow of activity in the muscles.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:30.780]   - Incredible. - Yes.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.920]   And this idea of singing helps you as well.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.080]   Even with Parkinson's patients and so forth,
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.020]   when they wanna say something,
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.260]   singing or listening to music helps them move better.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:45.160]   And the idea there is that the brain circuits for singing,
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.960]   or let's say the function of the brain circuits for speech
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:51.460]   being used for singing first is the more ancestral trait.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:54.280]   And that's why it's easier to do things with singing
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.220]   sometimes than it is with speaking.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.060]   - I love it.
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:02.260]   Stutter is a particularly interesting case.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:04.500]   And one that every once in a while,
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.920]   I'll get questions about this from our audience.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.100]   Stutter is complicated in a number of ways,
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:14.560]   but culturally, in my understanding from these emails
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.180]   that I receive is that stutter can often cause people
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.980]   to hide and speak less because it can be embarrassing.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.160]   And we are often not patient with stutter.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.540]   We also have the assumption that if somebody's stuttering,
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.620]   that their thinking is slow,
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.460]   but it turns out there are many examples historically
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.160]   of people who could not speak well,
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.400]   but who were brilliant thinkers.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.900]   I don't know how well they could write,
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:40.400]   but they found other modes of communication.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.100]   I realize that you're not a speech pathologist or therapist,
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.780]   but what is the current neurobiological understanding
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.900]   of stutter and what's being developed
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.540]   in terms of treatments for stutter?
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:58.460]   - Yeah, so we actually accidentally came across
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.300]   stuttering in songbirds.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.020]   And we've published several papers on this
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.900]   to try to figure out the neurobiological basis.
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.400]   The first study we had was a brain area
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:11.640]   called the basal ganglia or the striatum part
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.900]   of the basal ganglia involved in coordinating movements,
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.840]   learning how to make movements.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:21.840]   When it was damaged in a speech-like pathway in these birds,
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.240]   what we found is that they started to stutter
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.160]   as the brain region recovered.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.880]   And unlike humans, they actually recovered
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.740]   after three or four months.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.860]   And why is that the case?
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:38.120]   Because bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.780]   in a way that human or mammal brains don't.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:46.660]   And it was the new neurons that were coming into the circuit
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:50.620]   but not quite with the right proper activity
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.500]   was resulting in this stuttering in these birds.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.940]   And after it was repaired,
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.860]   not exactly the old song came back after the repair,
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.420]   but still it recovered a lot better.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:07.420]   And it's now known, they call this neurogenics stuttering
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.540]   in humans with damage to the basal ganglia
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.300]   or some type of disruption to the basal ganglia
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:16.700]   at a young age also causes stuttering in humans.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.360]   And even those who are born with stuttering,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.940]   it's often the basal ganglia that's disrupted
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.500]   than some other brain circuit.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   And we think the speech part of the basal ganglia.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:33.020]   - Can adults who maintain a stutter from childhood
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.460]   repair that stutter?
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.840]   - They can repair it with a therapy,
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.340]   with learning how to speak slower,
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:42.060]   learning how to tap out a rhythm during such.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.820]   And yeah, I'm not a speech pathologist,
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.700]   but I started reading this literature
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.460]   and talking to others that colleagues
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.540]   who actually study stuttering.
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:54.980]   So yes, there are ways to overcome the stuttering
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:58.940]   through behavioral therapy.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:04.180]   And I think all of the tools out there
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.780]   have something to do with sensory motor integration.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.340]   Controlling what you hear with what you output
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:15.960]   in a thoughtful, controlled way helps reduce the stuttering.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.700]   - There are a couple examples from real life
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.640]   that I want to touch on.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.860]   And one is somewhat facetious,
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:25.860]   but now I realize is a serious neurobiological issue.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.660]   Serious meaning, I think, interesting,
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.180]   which is that every once in a while,
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.180]   I will have a conversation with somebody
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:37.100]   who says the last word of the sentence along with me.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.860]   And it seems annoying in some instances,
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.900]   but I'm guessing this is just a breakthrough
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.500]   of the motor pattern that they're hearing
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.300]   what I'm saying very well.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.340]   So I'm going to interpret this kindly and think
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.020]   they're hearing what I'm saying.
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.540]   They're literally hearing it in their mind
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.540]   and they're getting that low level electrical activity
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.380]   to their throat.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:01.260]   And they're just joining me in the enunciation
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:04.680]   of what I'm saying, probably without realizing it.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.220]   Can we assume that that might be the case?
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.320]   - Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.800]   So the motor theory of speech perception
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.100]   where this idea originally came,
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.420]   what you hear is going through your speech circuit
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.280]   and then also activating those muscles slightly.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:24.020]   So yes, so one might argue, okay,
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.380]   is that speech circuit now interpreting
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.520]   what that person is speaking now you listening to me
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.940]   and is going to finish it off
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.860]   because it's already going through their brain
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.800]   and they can predict it.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.120]   That would be one theory.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.840]   I don't think the verdict out there is no,
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.020]   but that's one.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:45.020]   The other is synchronizing turn-taking in the conversation
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:52.100]   where you're acknowledging that we understand each other
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:54.180]   by finishing off what I say.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:58.580]   And it's almost like a social bonding kind of thing.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.820]   The other could be, I want the person to shut out
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.260]   so I can speak as well and take that turn.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:08.260]   And each pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:10.460]   And if you have somebody who's over-talkative
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.880]   versus under-talkative or vice versa,
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.520]   that rhythm can be lost in them finishing ideas
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.960]   and going back and forth.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.940]   But I think having something to do with turn-taking as well
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:22.340]   makes a lot of sense.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.800]   - I have a colleague at Stanford who says
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.820]   that interruption is a sign of interest.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.240]   I'm not sure that everyone agrees.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.140]   I think it's highly contextual,
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:34.940]   but there is this form of a verbal nod of saying,
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.480]   "Mm-hmm," or things of that sort.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.720]   And there are many of these.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.780]   And I'm often told by my audience
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:43.140]   that I interrupt my guests and things of that sort.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.100]   Oftentimes I'll just get caught in the natural flow
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.760]   of the conversation.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.700]   - Well, I think we've had pretty good turn-taking here,
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.540]   I hope.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.360]   - So far so good.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.200]   - I feel that way.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.100]   - I'm glad you feel that way,
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.960]   because especially in the context of a discussion
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.340]   about language, this seems important.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.200]   Texting is a very, very interesting evolution of language,
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.520]   because what you've told us is that we have a thought,
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.520]   it's translated into language.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.240]   It might not be complete sentences, but texting,
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.560]   I have to imagine this is the first time in human evolution
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.600]   where we've written with our thumbs.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.160]   So I don't, you know, it seems more primitive to me
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.640]   than typing with fingers around your hands,
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.720]   but hey, who am I to judge the evolution of our species
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.320]   in one direction or the other?
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.360]   But the shorthand grammatically,
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.660]   often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:37.760]   of texting is an incredible thing to see.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.280]   Early in relationships, romantic relationships,
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.260]   people will often evaluate the other's text
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.100]   and their ability to use proper grammar
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.480]   and spelling, et cetera.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.840]   This often quickly degrades, and there's an acceptance
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.320]   that we're just trying to communicate through shorthand.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.880]   Almost military-like shorthand,
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.700]   but with internally consistent between people,
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.940]   but there's no general consensus of what things mean.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:07.940]   But, you know, WTFs and OMGs and all sorts of things.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:12.640]   I wonder sometimes whether or not we are getting
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.160]   less proficient at speech because we are not required
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.660]   to write and think in complete sentences.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.920]   I'm not being judgmental here.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.960]   I see this in my colleagues, I see this in myself.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.980]   This is not a judgment of the younger generation.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:34.880]   I also know that slang has existed for decades,
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.360]   if not hundreds of years,
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.280]   but I also know that I don't speak the same way
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.240]   that I did when I was a teenager
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.340]   because I've suppressed a lot of that slang.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:45.300]   Not because it's inappropriate or offensive,
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.940]   although some of it was, frankly,
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:50.520]   but because it's out of context.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.020]   - So what do you think is happening to language?
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:56.080]   Are we getting better at speaking, worse at speaking?
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.980]   And what do you think the role of things like texting
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:02.840]   and tweeting and shorthand communication, hashtagging,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.320]   what's that doing to the way that our brains work?
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:10.320]   - Yeah, I think that, one, in terms of, you know,
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.320]   measuring your level of sophistication and intelligence
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.200]   and you say OMG, right?
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.080]   I think that also could be a cultural thing,
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.940]   that, ah, you belong to the next generation.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.920]   If you're, you know, or you're being cool
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.960]   if you're an older person, you know,
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:29.040]   using OMG and other things that the, you know,
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.040]   younger generation would use.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.380]   But if I really think about it clearly,
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:39.320]   texting actually has allowed
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:43.360]   for more rapid communication amongst people.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.680]   I think without the invention of the phone before then,
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.120]   or, you know, texting back and forth,
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.380]   you had to wait days for a letter to show up.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.920]   You couldn't call somebody on the phone and talk as well,
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.840]   you know, and so this rapid communication,
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.400]   but in terms of the rapid communication
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.600]   of writing in this case.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:06.560]   So I think actually, it's more like a use it or lose it
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:10.140]   kind of a thing with the brain.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.620]   The more you use a particular brain region or circuit,
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.320]   the more enhanced, it's like a muscle.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.160]   The more you exercise it, the more healthier it is,
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.240]   the bigger it becomes and the more space it takes
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.400]   and the more you lose something else.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:28.400]   So I think texting is not decreasing
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:34.260]   the speech prowess or the intellectual prowess of speech.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:38.080]   It's converting it and using it a lot in a different way.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:43.280]   In a way that may not be as rich in regular writing
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:47.600]   because you can only communicate so much nuance
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   in short term writing, but whatever is being done,
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   you got people texting hours and hours and hours on the phone
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.980]   so whatever, your thumb circuit
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.040]   is gonna get pretty big actually.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:04.340]   - I do wonder whether, you know,
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.060]   many people have lost their jobs based on tweets.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:11.600]   The short latency between thought and action
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.920]   and distribution of one's thoughts is incredible.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:20.080]   And I'm not just talking about people who have,
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:23.980]   who apparently would have poor prefrontal top-down control.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.240]   This is geek speak, by the way,
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.360]   for people that lack impulse control.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.860]   But high-level academics,
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.520]   I'm not gonna point fingers at anyone,
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.320]   but examples of where you see these tweets
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.840]   and you go, "What were they thinking?"
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.800]   So presumably there's an optimal strategy
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.360]   between the thought, speech, motor pathway,
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.320]   especially when the motor pathway engages communication
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.160]   with hundreds of thousands of people
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.680]   and retweets in particular and the cut and paste function
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.240]   and the screenshot function
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.680]   are often the reason why speech propagates.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.520]   - Yep.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.520]   - So to me, it's a little eerie
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.520]   that just that the neural circuitry can do this
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:08.840]   and that we are catching up a little bit more slowly
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.600]   to the technology and you've got these casualties
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.600]   of that mismatch.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.320]   - I think that's a good adjective to use, the casualties,
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.360]   you know, of what's going on.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.320]   Because yes, it is the case with texting.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.460]   What you're really losing there
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.320]   is less so the ability to write,
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:32.000]   but more the ability to interpret what is being written.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.420]   And you can over-undeterpit something that somebody means.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.360]   - On the flip side of that, you know,
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.460]   when if somebody is writing something very quick,
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:47.140]   they could be writing instinctually, more instinctually,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:51.840]   their true meaning, and they don't have time to modify
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.040]   and color code what they're trying to say.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.920]   And that's what they really feel
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.200]   as opposed to say in a more nuanced way.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:05.040]   So I think both sides of that casualty are present
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.040]   and that's a downturn, an unintended negative consequence
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:14.840]   of short word communication.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.400]   - Yeah, I agree that this whole phenomenon
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.600]   could be netting people that normally
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.280]   would only say these things out loud
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.880]   once inside the door of their own home or not at all.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.280]   It's an interesting time that we're in
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.960]   vis-a-vis speech and language and motor patterns.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.880]   - So part of the human evolution for language,
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.440]   I think this is all part of our evolution.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.640]   - That's right.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.360]   So for those of you thinking terrible thoughts,
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.320]   please put them in the world and be a casualty.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.640]   And for those of you that are not,
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.280]   please be very careful with how proficient
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:48.000]   your thought to language to motor action goes.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.120]   Maybe the technology companies should install some buffers,
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.760]   some AI-based buffers.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.640]   - Right, that's taking some EEG signals from your brain
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:56.960]   while you're texting to say,
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.080]   okay, this is not a great thought, slow down.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:04.840]   - Right, this doesn't reflect your best state.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.240]   That brings me to what was going to be
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.240]   the next question anyway,
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.900]   which is we are quickly moving toward a time
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.240]   where there will be an even faster transition
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:18.600]   from thought to speech, to motor output,
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.760]   and maybe won't require motor output.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:23.320]   What I'm referring to here is some of the incredible work
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.560]   of our colleagues, Eddie Chang at UCSF
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:29.560]   and others who are taking paralyzed human beings
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:33.120]   and learning to translate the electrical signals of neurons
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.540]   in various areas, including speech and language areas,
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.480]   to computer screens that type out
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:38.400]   what these people are thinking.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400]   In other words, paralyzed people can put their thoughts
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.320]   on into writing.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.000]   That's a pretty extreme and wonderful example of recovery
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.340]   of function that is sure to continue to evolve.
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:53.560]   But I think we are headed toward a time not too long
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.960]   from now where my thoughts can be translated
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.540]   into words on a page.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.460]   If I allow that to happen.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.000]   - Yeah, so, and Eddie Chang's work,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.380]   which I admire quite a bit in sight in my papers,
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:10.160]   I think he's really one of those at the leading edge
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.680]   of trying to understand within humans
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.620]   the neurobiology of speech.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.680]   And he may not say it directly,
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.000]   but I talked to him about this.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.960]   It supports this idea that the speech circuit
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.620]   and the separate language module,
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:26.840]   I don't really think that there's a separation there.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.040]   So with that knowledge, yes,
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.320]   and putting electrodes in the human brain
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.380]   and then translating those electrical signals
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.400]   to speech currents, yeah,
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.260]   we can start to tell what is that person thinking.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.100]   Why?
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.160]   Because we often think in terms of speech
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.960]   and without saying words.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.660]   And that's a scary thought.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.780]   And now imagine if you can now translate those
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:52.700]   into a signal that transmits something wirelessly
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:55.640]   and so on from some distant part of the planet
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:58.680]   is hearing your speech from a wireless signal
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.560]   without you speaking.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.560]   So probably that won't be done in an ethical way, who knows?
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.260]   I mean, the ethics of doing that probably might not happen,
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.100]   but who knows?
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.420]   We have these songbirds.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.980]   We apply the same technique to them.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:16.420]   We can start to hear what they're singing
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:18.480]   in their dreams or whatever,
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:19.800]   even though they don't produce sound.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.340]   So we can find out by testing on them.
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.820]   - It's coming, one way or another, it's coming.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:28.220]   For those listening who are interested
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:32.500]   in getting better at speaking and understanding languages,
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.740]   are there any tools that you recommend?
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:37.860]   And here again, I realize you're not a speech therapist,
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.740]   but here I'm not thinking about ameliorating
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.220]   any kind of speech deficiency.
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:44.060]   I'm thinking, for instance,
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:48.600]   do you recommend that people read different types of writing?
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.420]   Would you recommend that people learn how to dance
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:54.380]   in order to become better at expressing themselves verbally?
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:00.220]   And feel free to have some degrees of freedom
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:01.600]   in this answer.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.200]   These are obviously not peer reviewed studies
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.160]   that we're referring to, although there may be,
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.100]   but I'm struck by the number of things
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.500]   that you do exceedingly well.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:16.140]   And I can't help but ask, well, the singing,
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.940]   which I realize your brother didn't pay me to say this,
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:21.420]   may not be quite as good as your brother's yet,
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:24.420]   but you'll surpass him, I'm guessing at some point.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:25.260]   - Getting there.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:28.180]   - Getting there, exactly, there you go.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:34.540]   Should kids learn how to dance and read hard books
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:35.940]   and simple books?
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:36.780]   What do you recommend?
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:38.060]   Should adults learn how to do that?
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.040]   Everyone wants to know how to keep their brain
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.780]   working better, so to speak,
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:44.620]   but also I think people want to be able to speak well
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.660]   and people want to be able to understand well.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:50.580]   - Yeah, so what I've discovered personally, right,
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:55.580]   is that, so when I switched from pursuing a career
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.320]   in science from a career in dance,
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.620]   I thought one day I would stop dancing,
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:06.120]   but I haven't because I find it fulfilling for me,
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:09.220]   just as a life experience.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:14.100]   So ever since I started college, my late teens
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:18.300]   and early 20s, I kept dancing even till this day.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.020]   And there've been periods of time, like during the pandemic,
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.260]   where I slowed down on dancing and so forth.
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:26.460]   And when you do that, you realize, okay,
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.740]   they're parts of your body where your muscle tone
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.060]   decreases a little bit and somewhat,
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.660]   or you could start to gain weight.
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:34.340]   I somehow don't gain weight that easily,
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:35.920]   and I think it's related to my dance,
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.980]   if that's meaningful to your audience.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:43.140]   But what I found is, in science,
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.040]   we like to think of a separation between movement
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.340]   and action and cognition.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.640]   And there is a separation between perception
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.620]   and production, cognition being perception,
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.860]   production being movement, right?
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.840]   But if the speech pathways is next to the movement pathways,
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.840]   what I discover is by dancing, it is helping me think.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.240]   It is helping keeping my brain fresh.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.340]   It's not just moving my muscles.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:13.100]   I'm moving or using the circuitry in my brain
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.500]   to control a whole big body.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.880]   You need a lot of brain tissue to do that.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.760]   And so I argue, if you wanna stay cognitively intact
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.720]   into your old age, you better be moving.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.440]   And you better be doing it consistently,
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.200]   whether it's dancing, walking, running,
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.960]   and also practicing speech, oratory speech and so forth,
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.640]   or singing, is controlling the brain circuits
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.540]   that are moving your facial musculature.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:44.680]   And it's gonna keep your cognitive circuits also in tune.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.460]   And I'm convinced of that from my own personal experience.
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:52.620]   - For me, long, slow runs are a wonderful way
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:56.800]   to kind of loosen the joints for long podcasts,
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.180]   especially the solo podcasts,
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.180]   which can take many hours to record.
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:03.340]   And without those long, slow runs,
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.880]   at least the day before or even the morning of,
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.260]   I don't think I could do it, at least not as well.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.840]   All right, well, you're experiencing something similar.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.040]   So that's an N of two.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:13.860]   - Yeah, N of two.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.820]   I'm tempted to learn how to dance
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:18.660]   because there are a lot of reasons to learn how to dance.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:21.140]   People can use their imagination.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.740]   I definitely wanna get the opportunity
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.960]   to talk about some of the newer work
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:30.960]   that you're into right now about genomes of animals.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.500]   As you perhaps can tell
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.160]   from my quite authentic facial expressions,
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.020]   I adore the animal kingdom.
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.140]   I just find it amazing.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.920]   And it's the reason I went into neurobiology, in part.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.440]   So many animals, so many different patterns of movement,
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.460]   so many body plans, so many specializations.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.020]   What is the value of learning the genomes
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:53.180]   of all these animals?
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.780]   I can think of conservation-based schemes
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:02.140]   of trying to preserve these precious critters,
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:04.220]   but what are you doing with the genomes of these animals?
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:06.540]   What do you wanna understand about their brain circuits?
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.420]   And how does this relate to some of the discussion
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:09.260]   we have been having up until now?
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:13.300]   - Yeah, I've gotten very heavily involved in genomes,
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.980]   not just to get at an individual gene
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:21.500]   involved in the trait of interest, like spoken language,
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:25.780]   but I realize that nature has done
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.500]   natural experiments for us.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:31.620]   With all these species out there, with these various traits,
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:33.860]   and the one that I'm studying, like vocal learning,
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:36.500]   has evolved multiple times among the animal kingdom,
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:39.580]   even if it's rare, it's multiple times.
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:44.580]   And the similar genetic changes occurred in those species.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:48.460]   But to find out what those genetic changes
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.620]   that are associated with the trait of interest,
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:53.440]   and not some other trait like flying in birds,
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.560]   as opposed to singing,
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.900]   you have to do what's called comparative genomics,
[01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:01.020]   even in the context of studying the brain.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:04.220]   And you need their genomes to compare the genomes
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:07.300]   and do like a GWAS, a genome-wide association study,
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.620]   not just within a species like humans, but across species.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.660]   And so you need good genomes to do that.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.380]   Plus, I've discovered I'm also interested
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.020]   in evolution and origins.
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:21.060]   How did these species come about a similar trait
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:26.060]   in the last 300 million years or 60 million years,
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:28.100]   depending on who you're talking about?
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:31.020]   And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.740]   And to get a good phylogenetic tree,
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.580]   you also need their genomes.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.980]   And so because of this,
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.680]   I got involved in large-scale consortiums
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.820]   to produce genomes of many different species,
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:45.140]   including my vocal learners and their closest relatives
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.420]   that I'm fans of.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.260]   But I couldn't convince the funding agencies
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:52.660]   to give me the money to do that just for my own project.
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:55.380]   But when you get a whole bunch of people together
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.080]   who wanna study various traits,
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:03.020]   heart disease or loss and gain of flight and so forth,
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:06.900]   suddenly we all need lots of genomes to do this.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:09.700]   And so now that got me into a project
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:12.700]   to lead something called the Vertebrate Genomes Project
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:16.740]   to eventually sequence all 70,000 species on the planet.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.780]   And Earth Biogenome Project, all eukaryotic species,
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.020]   all 2 million of them.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:26.820]   And to no longer be in a situation
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:28.980]   where I wish I had this genome,
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:32.300]   now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet,
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.740]   create a database of all their traits
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:38.980]   and find the genetic association with everything out there
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.580]   that makes a difference from one species to another.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:47.380]   One more piece of the equation to add to this story
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:50.900]   is what I didn't realize as a neuroscientist
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:55.180]   were that these genomes are not only incomplete,
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:58.260]   but they have lots of errors in them.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:01.820]   False gene duplications where mother and father chromosomes
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.940]   were so different from each other
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:06.740]   that the genome algorithm, assembly algorithms
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.340]   treated them as two different genes
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.540]   in this part of the chromosome.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.920]   So there are a lot of these false duplicated genes
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.180]   that people were thought were real but were not.
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:18.480]   Or missing parts of the genome
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:21.740]   because the enzymes used to sequence the DNA
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.860]   couldn't get through this regulatory region
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:28.500]   that folded up on itself and made it hard to sequence.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.780]   And so I ended up in these consortiums
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:35.700]   pulling in the genome sequencing companies
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:38.820]   developing the technology to work with us
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.140]   to improve it further.
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.580]   And the computer science guys who then take that data
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.380]   and that technology and try to make the complete genomes
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.700]   and make the algorithms better to produce
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.980]   what we now just did recently,
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:53.820]   led by Anafr, Bayad, and Filippi,
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.560]   is the first human telomere to telomere genome
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:00.780]   with no errors, all complete, no missing sequence.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:02.420]   And now we're trying to do the same thing
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.820]   with vertebrates and other species.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.700]   Actually, we improved that before we got to the,
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:09.080]   what we call telomere to telomere,
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.620]   from one end of the chromosome to another.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:15.180]   And what we're discovering is in this dark matter
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.700]   of the genome that was missing before
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.580]   turns out to be some regulatory regions
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:23.340]   that are specialized in vocal learning species
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:26.660]   and we think are involved in developing speech circuits.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.700]   - Incredible.
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.700]   Well, so much to learn
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:32.100]   and that we're going to learn from this information.
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:35.260]   Early on in these genome projects and connectome projects,
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.020]   I confess I was a little bit cynical.
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.580]   This would be about 10, 15 years ago.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:42.620]   I thought, okay, necessary, but not sufficient for anything.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.580]   We need it, but it's not clear what's going to happen.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.220]   But you just gave a very clear example
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.620]   of what we stand to learn from this kind of information.
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.580]   And I know from the conservation side,
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.800]   there's a huge interest in this
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.420]   because even though we would prefer
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:58.800]   to keep all these species alive rather than clone them,
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.320]   these sorts of projects do offer the possibility
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.500]   of potentially recreating species that were lost
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:09.420]   due to our own ignorance or missteps or what have you.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.160]   - Yes, and along those lines,
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.120]   because we got involved in genomics,
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:19.340]   some of the first species that we start working on
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.500]   are critically endangered species.
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:26.500]   And I'm doing that not only for perspectives
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:27.500]   to understand their brains
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.380]   and the genes involved in their brain function,
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:31.800]   but I feel like it's a moral duty.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:34.560]   So the fact that now I've become more involved
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:37.640]   in genome biology and have helped develop these tools
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:39.000]   for more complete genomes,
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.820]   let's capture their genetic code now before they're gone.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:47.940]   And could we use that information to resurrect the species
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:50.960]   at some future time, if not in my lifetime,
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.820]   in some time in the future and generations ahead of us.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:59.540]   And so in anticipation of that,
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.080]   we create a database we call the Genome Arc,
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.940]   and no pun intended, like NOAA's arc,
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:08.320]   meant to store the genetic code
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.840]   as complete genome assemblies as possible
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.660]   for all species on the planet to be used for basic science,
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:17.300]   but also some point in the future.
[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.420]   And because of that,
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.720]   funding agencies or private foundations
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.500]   that are interested in conservation
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:26.660]   have been reaching out to me now, a neuroscientist,
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:30.420]   to help them out in producing high quality genome data
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.460]   of endangered species that they can use
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.200]   like Revive and Restore,
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.560]   who want to resurrect the passenger pigeon,
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.780]   or Colossal, who wants to resurrect the wooly mammoth.
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:43.060]   And so we're producing high quality genomes for these groups
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.740]   for their conservation projects.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:47.260]   - What a terrific and important initiative.
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.100]   And I think for those listening today,
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.060]   they now certainly understand the value
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:56.500]   of deeply understanding the brain structures
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.420]   and genomes of different species,
[01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:00.300]   because I confess,
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.820]   even though I knew a bit of the songbird literature,
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:03.860]   and I certainly understand
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:05.460]   that humans have speech and language,
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:08.060]   I had no idea that there was so much convergence
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:10.260]   of function, structure, and genomes.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:14.100]   And to me, I feel a lot more like an ape
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:15.740]   than I do a songbird.
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:18.540]   And yet here we are with the understanding
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.780]   that there's a lot more similarity between songbirds
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.340]   and humans than I certainly ever thought before.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:27.380]   - Yeah, something very close to home for us humans,
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:31.160]   I can give you an example of, is evolution of skin color.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.140]   In skin color, we use it, unfortunately,
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.180]   for racism and so forth.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.620]   We use it also for good things,
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:41.340]   to let in more light or let out less light.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.680]   Depending on the part of the planet,
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.340]   our population evolved in.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:47.620]   And most people think dark-skinned people
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:50.000]   all evolved from the same dark-skinned person,
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.680]   and light-skinned people all evolved
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.760]   from the same light-skinned person,
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.420]   but that's not the case.
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:57.420]   Dark skin and light skin amongst humans
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:00.640]   has evolved independently multiple times,
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.640]   like in the Pacific Islands versus Africa.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:07.060]   And it's just depending on the angle of light
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:08.460]   hitting the Earth,
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:10.660]   as to whether you need more protection from the sun
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.800]   or less protection that's also associated
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.520]   with vitamin D synthesis in the skin.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:23.640]   And each time where a darker or lighter skin
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.520]   evolved independently, it hit the same gene.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.760]   The melatonin receptors, that's right, yes, yeah.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.140]   Genes that are involved in melanin formation.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:41.100]   And so those genes evolved some of the same mutations,
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.680]   even in different species.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.380]   It's not just humans.
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:48.260]   In equatorial regions, there are darker-skinned animals
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.580]   than going away from the equator.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.300]   - All right, I think of arctic foxes and things like that.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.200]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.700]   Polar bears, you know?
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:59.700]   And so some of the same genes are used
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.460]   in an evolutionary perspective to evolve
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:05.140]   in a similar way within and across species.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.200]   - Incredible.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.360]   And that's the same thing happening in the brain too.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.040]   Language is no exception.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:10.880]   - Well, I have to say,
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.200]   as somebody who is a career neuroscientist,
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.880]   but as I mentioned several times now,
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:18.280]   who also adores the animal kingdom,
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.200]   but is also obsessed with speech and language
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.200]   and at a distance, not as a practitioner of music and dance,
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.320]   this has been an incredible conversation
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.440]   and opportunity for me to learn.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.560]   I know I speak for a tremendous number of people
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.320]   and I just really want to say thank you
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.800]   for joining us today.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.000]   You are incredibly busy.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.500]   It's clear from your description of your science
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.220]   and your knowledge base that you are involved
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.320]   in a huge number of things, very busy.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.280]   So thank you for taking the time to speak to all of us.
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.080]   Thank you for the work that you're doing,
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.640]   both on speech and language,
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.760]   but also this important work on genomes
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:00.720]   and conservation of endangered species and far more.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.360]   And I have to say, if you would agree to come back
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:05.000]   and speak to us again sometime,
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.480]   I'm certain that if we were to sit down
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.160]   even six months or a year from now,
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.400]   there's going to be a lot more to come.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.680]   - Yeah, we have some things cooking
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:14.440]   and thank you for inviting me here to get the word out
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:18.440]   to the community of what's going on in the science world.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.680]   - Well, we're honored and very grateful to you, Eric.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:22.400]   Thank you. - You're welcome.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.500]   - Thank you for joining me today
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.700]   for my discussion with Dr. Eric Jarvis.
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:28.360]   If you'd like to learn more about his laboratory's work,
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.160]   you can go to Jarvis Lab,
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:35.020]   spelled J-A-R-V-I-S, lab, all one word, JarvisLab.net.
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.140]   And there you can learn about all the various studies
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:38.940]   taking place in his laboratory,
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.080]   as well as some of the larger overarching themes
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.720]   that are driving those studies,
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:45.980]   including studies on human genomics and animal genomics
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:49.600]   that surely are going to lead to the next stage discoveries
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:53.920]   of how we learn and think about and indeed use language.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:56.320]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:37.800]   We are Huberman Lab on Twitter
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.860]   and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:43.200]   And both places I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.760]   some of which overlap with the content
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.920]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:48.520]   but much of which is unique from the content covered
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.680]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:51.400]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.040]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.960]   Please also check out our Neural Network monthly newsletter.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:59.440]   This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.720]   It also includes a lot of actionable protocols.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:03.780]   It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:05.940]   You go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:08.000]   go to newsletter, you supply your email,
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]   but we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.920]   We have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy,
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.120]   which is we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.640]   And the newsletter comes out once a month
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.160]   and it is completely zero cost.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.200]   Again, just go to HubermanLab.com
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.660]   and go to the Neural Network newsletter.
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:25.940]   I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.480]   has a clips channel, so these are brief clips,
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.520]   anywhere from three to 10 minutes
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:35.080]   that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:38.280]   related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:39.660]   We talk about things like caffeine,
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:42.760]   when to drink caffeine relative to sleep, alcohol,
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:44.740]   when and how and if anyone should ingest it
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:48.400]   relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health,
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.000]   physical health, and on and on,
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.960]   all the things that relate to the topics
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:53.300]   most of interest to you.
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:55.960]   You can find that easily by going to YouTube,
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.880]   look for Huberman Lab Clips in the search area,
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.440]   and it will take you there, subscribe,
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.760]   and we are constantly updating those with new clips.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:04.320]   This is especially useful, I believe,
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.340]   for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:07.960]   or you're still working through the back catalog
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.040]   of Huberman Lab Podcasts,
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.160]   which admittedly can be rather long.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:13.460]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:15.220]   thank you for your interest in science.
