[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   Over the last century, we've had this huge conflict.
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.140]   All the oxygen's been sucked up by capitalism and socialism duking it out.
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.040]   We have this assumption that you either have to be pro-worker or pro-business,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.340]   that you can't be both.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.680]   I have noticed a lot of crypto people get into Georgism,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.580]   not the least of which is Vitalik Buterin, who endorsed my book.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.180]   If you earn $100,000 in San Francisco as a family of four,
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.020]   you are below the poverty line.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.760]   Let's start with just taxing the things nobody has made
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.220]   and that people are gatekeeping access to.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.020]   Let's tax, essentially, monopolies and rent-seeking.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.360]   The income tax needs to do this full anal probe on everyone in the country
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.260]   and then audits the poor at a higher rate than the rich.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.840]   And it's just this horrible burden we have.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.180]   Okay, today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Lars Ducey,
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.080]   who developed the highly acclaimed Defender's Quest game,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.680]   and part two is coming out next year, but now he's working on a new startup.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.160]   But the reason we're talking is that he wrote a review of Henry George's
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.120]   Progress and Poverty that won Scott Alexander's book review contest.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.100]   And now it has been turned into and expanded into this book,
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.060]   Land is a Big Deal.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.100]   So, Lars, welcome to the podcast.
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.260]   Great to be here, Dwarkesh.
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.600]   Okay, so let's just get into it. What is Georgism?
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.140]   Okay, so the book is based off of the philosophy of a 19th century
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.040]   American economist by the name of Henry George, from Once We Get Georgism.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.180]   And basically, George's thesis is kind of the title of my book,
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.920]   that land is a big deal.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.660]   Georgism is often reduced to its main policy prescription,
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.460]   that we should have a land value tax,
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.820]   which is a tax on the unimproved value of land,
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.160]   but not a tax on any buildings or infrastructure on top of the land,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.860]   anything humans add.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.900]   But the basic insight of it is that it's kind of reflected in the
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.600]   aphorisms you hear from real estate agents.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.340]   When they say things like the three laws of real estate are location,
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.600]   location, location, and by land,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.480]   it's the one thing they're not making any more of.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.420]   It's basically this insight that land has this hidden role in the economy
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.180]   that is really underrated.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.820]   But if you look at history through the right lens,
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.960]   control over land is the oldest struggle of human history.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.020]   It goes beyond human history.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.420]   Animals have been fighting over land forever.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.660]   That's what they're fighting over in Ukraine and Russia right now, right?
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.060]   And basically, the fundamental insight of Georgism is that over the last
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.040]   century, we've had this huge conflict.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.640]   All the oxygen's been sucked up by capitalism and socialism duking it out.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.540]   We have this assumption that you either have to be pro-worker or pro-business,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.880]   that you can't be both.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.480]   And Georgism is genuinely pro-worker and pro-business.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.060]   But what it's against is land speculation.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.120]   And if we can find a way to share the earth,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.220]   then we can solve the paradox that is the title of George's book,
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.400]   Progress and Poverty.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.140]   Why does poverty advance even when progress advances?
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.080]   Why do we have all this industrialized technology and new methods?
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.620]   And in George's time, it was industrial technology.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.580]   In our time, it's computers and everything else.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.120]   We have all this good stuff.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.620]   We can make more than we've ever made before.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.260]   There's enough wealth for everybody.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.420]   And yet we still have inequality.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.260]   Where does it come from?
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.160]   And George answers that question in his book.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.300]   And I expand on it in mine.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.120]   - Yep, yep.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.660]   OK, so yeah, I'm excited to get into the theory of all of it in a second.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.360]   But first, I'm curious, how much of your interest in the subject
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.340]   has been inspired by the fact that as a game developer,
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.740]   you're constantly dealing with decentralized rent seekers
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.780]   like Steam or iOS, App Store.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.180]   Is that part of the inspiration behind your interest in Georgism?
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.080]   Or is that separate?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.920]   - It's interesting.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.360]   I wouldn't say that's what clued me into it in the first place.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.260]   But I have become very interested in all forms of rent seeking, right?
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.100]   In this general category of things we call land-like assets
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.500]   that come to first mover advantages in these large platform economies.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.200]   I've started to think a lot about it, basically.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   But the essence of land speculation is you have this entire class of people
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.480]   who are able to basically gatekeep access to a scarce resource
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.640]   that everybody needs, which is land, right?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.340]   That you can't opt out of needing.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.020]   And because of that, everyone basically has to pay them rent.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.260]   And those people don't necessarily do anything.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.720]   You know, they just got there first and tell everyone else,
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.860]   it's like, well, if you want to participate in the world,
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.960]   you need to pay me.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.600]   And so where I actually,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.840]   where the actual connection with game development
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.340]   actually clued me into Georgism is like,
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.940]   I'd heard about Georgism before.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.780]   I'd read about it.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.940]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.140]   But then I started noticing this weird phenomenon
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.480]   in online multiplayer games going back 30 years repeatedly
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.580]   of virtual housing crises,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.580]   which is the most bizarre concept in the world to me.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.780]   Like, basically a housing crisis in the metaverse
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.820]   and predecessors to the metaverse.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.900]   And as early as Ultima Online when I was 19, you know,
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.500]   this is this online game that you could play
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.340]   and you could build houses in the game
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.740]   and put them down somewhere.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.860]   And so what I found was that houses were actually like fairly cheap.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.140]   Like you could work, you know,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.980]   long enough in the game to be afforded to like buy blueprints for a house,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.580]   which will let you put it somewhere, but there was no land to put it on.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.920]   And I, at the time I thought, oh, well, I guess the server filled up.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.420]   You know, I didn't really think much about it.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.420]   I was like, this stinks.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.580]   I didn't join the game early enough.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.740]   You know, I'm kind of screwed out of housing.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.820]   And then I kind of forgot about it.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.580]   And then like 20 years later, I checked back in
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.940]   and that housing crisis is still ongoing in that game.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.220]   That game is still running, you know, a good 25 years later.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.820]   And that housing crisis remains unsolved.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.540]   And you have this entire black market for housing, you know,
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.060]   and then I noticed that that trend was repeated
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.340]   in other online games like Final Fantasy 14.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.240]   And then recently in 2022, with all this huge wave of crypto games
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.880]   like Axie Infinity and Decentraland and The Sandbox,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   and then Yuga Labs' Board Ape Yacht Club,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.480]   the other side, had all these big land sales.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.400]   And at the time, I was working as an analyst
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.280]   for a video game consulting firm called Novik.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.320]   And I told my employers, it's like,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.680]   we are going to see all the same problems happen.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.040]   We are going to see virtual land speculation.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.320]   They're going to hit a virtual, they're going to reproduce
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.720]   the conditions of housing crisis in the real world.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.520]   And it's going to be a disaster.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.960]   And I called it and it turns out I was right.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.360]   And we've now seen that whole cycle kind of work itself out.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.760]   And it just kind of blew my mind
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.400]   that we could reproduce the problems of the real world
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.920]   so articulately in the virtual world
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.600]   without anyone trying to do it.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.760]   It just happened.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.600]   And that is kind of the actual connection
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.520]   between my background in game design
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.600]   and kind of getting George-pilled
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.960]   as the internet kids call it these days.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.240]   - There's a hilarious clip.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.340]   Some comedian was on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.560]   I think it was like Tim Dillon.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.440]   And they're talking about, I think, Decentraland,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.560]   where if you want to be Snoop Dogg's neighbor
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.780]   in the metaverse, it costs like a couple million dollars
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.620]   or something.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.960]   And Joe Rogan was like,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.320]   so you think you can afford to live there?
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.960]   And then Tim Dillon's like, no,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.120]   but I'm going to start another metaverse
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.240]   and I'm going to work hard.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.680]   (laughs)
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   But okay, so let's go into Georgism itself.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.840]   So Tyler Cowen had a blog post a long time ago
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   where he was comparing taxing land
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.560]   to taxing unimproved labor or unimproved capital.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.720]   And it's an interesting concept, right?
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   Like should I, so I have a CS degree, right?
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.240]   Should I be taxed at the same level
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.680]   as an entry-level software engineer
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.000]   instead of a podcaster
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.560]   because I'm not using my time as efficiently as possible.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.640]   And so leisure in another way is the labor equivalent
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.160]   of having an unimproved parking lot
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.440]   in the middle of San Francisco.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.320]   For capital, if I'm just keeping my capital
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.800]   out of the economy and therefore making it not useful,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.920]   maybe I should have that capital taxed
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.340]   at the rate of like the capital gains on T-bill.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.640]   And this way, you're not punishing people
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.700]   for having profitable investments,
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.600]   which you're kind of doing with the capital gains.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.440]   - Right.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.960]   - What would you think of that comparison?
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.120]   - Yeah, so really, before you can even answer that question,
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.980]   you gotta go back to ground moral principles
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.820]   you're operating on.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.040]   Like is your moral operating principle
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.520]   like we just wanna increase efficiency,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   so we're gonna tax everyone in a way
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.560]   to like basically account for the wasted opportunity cost,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   which brings up a lot of other questions
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.000]   of like, well, who decides what that is?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.080]   But I think the Georgist argument is a little different.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.560]   We're not necessarily, like it is efficient,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.040]   the tax we propose, but it actually stems
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.440]   kind of from a more, from a different place,
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.040]   a more kind of fundamental aspect of justice, you know?
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.560]   And from our perspective, if you work and you produce value,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.140]   your work produced that value, right?
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.800]   And if you save money and accumulate capital
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.040]   in order to put that capital to work to receive a return,
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   you've also provided something valuable to society,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.160]   you know, you saved money so a factory could exist, right?
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.600]   You saved money so that a shipping company
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.720]   could get off the ground.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.420]   You know, those are valuable, contributive things,
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.040]   but nobody made the earth.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.400]   The earth pre-exists all of us.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.700]   And so someone who provides land
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.480]   actually does the opposite of providing land.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.320]   They unprovide land,
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   and then they charge you for opening the gate.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.720]   And so the argument for charging people
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.440]   on the unimproved value of land
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.100]   is that we want to tax unproductive rent-seeking.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.940]   We want to tax non-produced assets,
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.820]   because we think we want to encourage people
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.960]   to produce assets.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.220]   We want to encourage people to produce labor,
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.500]   to produce capital.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.680]   We want more of those things, and there's that aphorism
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.600]   that if you want less of something, you should tax it.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.120]   So, I mean, maybe there is a case
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.060]   for some kind of galaxy brain take of, you know,
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.840]   taxing unrealized opportunity costs or whatever,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.360]   but I'm less interested in that,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.460]   and my moral principles are more about,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.220]   let's start with just taxing the things nobody has made
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.680]   and that people are gatekeeping access to.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.920]   Let's tax, essentially, monopolies and rent-seeking.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.140]   And then, if we still need to raise more taxes,
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.160]   we can talk about that later.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   But let's start with just taxing the worst things in society
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.180]   and then stop taxing things we actually want more of,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.160]   because we have this mentality right now
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.500]   where everything's a trade-off
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.980]   and we have to accept the downsides of income taxes,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.580]   of sales taxes, of capital taxes,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.860]   because we just need the revenue
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.420]   and it has to come from somewhere.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.720]   And my argument is it's like,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.360]   it can come from a much better somewhere,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.700]   so let's start with that.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.080]   So, I guess if it was the case
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.620]   that we've implemented a land value tax
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.980]   and we're still having a revenue shortfall
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.520]   and we need another kind of tax
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.420]   and we're going to have to keep income taxes
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.960]   or capital gains taxes,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.300]   would you, in that situation, prefer a sort of tax
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.140]   where you're basically taxed
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.900]   on the opportunity cost of your time
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.920]   rather than the actual income you generated
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.300]   or the returns, interest you've generated on your capital?
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.020]   - No, I think probably not.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.200]   I think you would probably want to go with some other,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.820]   just like simpler tax for the sake of it,
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.500]   'cause there's too many degrees of freedom in there.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.020]   And it's like, and we can talk about
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.260]   why I will defend the Georgist case
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.420]   for property tax assessments, for land value tax.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.500]   But I think it gets different
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.020]   when you start judging
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.120]   what is the most valuable use of your time.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.960]   Because that's a much more subjective question.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.260]   Like, okay, are you providing more value to society
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.600]   as being a podcaster or being a CS,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.580]   a computer science person, or creating a startup?
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.700]   It's like, that may not be evident for some time.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.500]   I can't think of an example,
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.400]   but think of people who were never successful
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.020]   during their lifetimes.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.220]   Like the guy who invented, what was it?
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.540]   FM radio, right?
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.280]   He threw himself out a window
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.620]   because he never got it really adopted during his lifetime,
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.920]   but it went on to change everything, you know?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.900]   So if we were taxing him during his lifetime
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.980]   based off of what he was doing of being a failure,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.020]   like if Van Gogh was taxed of his like,
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.500]   wasting his life as an artist as he thought he was,
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.100]   which ultimately led to his suicide,
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.100]   you know, a lot of these things
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.800]   are not necessarily realized at the time.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.260]   And so I think that's,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.900]   and you know, it would need a much bigger
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.740]   kind of bureaucracy to like figure that all out.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.540]   So I think you should go with a more modest,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.140]   I mean, I think after land value tax,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.140]   you should do things like severance tax on natural resources
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.280]   and other taxes on other monopolies and rents.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.740]   And so I think the next move after land value tax
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.940]   is not immediately to capital and income taxes
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.060]   and sales taxes,
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.300]   but to other taxes on other rent seeking
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.460]   and other land like assets
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.700]   that aren't literally physically land.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.620]   And then only after you've done all of those,
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.260]   if you still, you know, absolutely then,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.940]   then move on to, you know, the bad taxes.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.260]   - What is a severance tax?
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.180]   - Severance tax is a tax on the extraction
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.620]   of natural resources.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.180]   Is what Norway does with their oil,
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.780]   with their oil industry that has been massively successful.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.300]   And a key reason that Norway has avoided the resource curse.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.140]   - Yeah.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.100]   - Basically it's,
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.860]   Georgia's purists will say it's essentially
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.460]   a land value tax, but of a different kind.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.900]   A land value tax, like you can't normally like extract
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.020]   just like land, like on this,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.180]   in this house you're living on,
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.380]   you're like, you're not using up this land,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.140]   but non-renewable resources you can use up, you know?
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.980]   And so a severance tax is basically,
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.940]   Nestle should be charged a severance tax
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.540]   for the water they're using, for instance, you know,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.660]   because all they're doing is enclosing
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.100]   a preexisting natural resource
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.620]   that used to belong to the people
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.020]   that they've essentially enclosed.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.340]   And now they're just putting it in bottles
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.940]   and selling it to people, you know?
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.340]   They should be able to realize the value
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.500]   of the value add they give to that water,
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.340]   but not to just taking that resource away.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.580]   - No, that makes sense.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.220]   Okay, so let's go deep into the actual theory
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.020]   and logic of Georgism.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.220]   - Okay.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   - One thing I was confused by is why property owners
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.940]   who have land in places that are really desirable
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.740]   are not already incentivized
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.220]   to make the most productive use of that land.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.020]   So even without a property, or sorry, a land tax,
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.540]   if you have some property in San Francisco,
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.580]   why are you not incentivized to construct it
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.660]   to the fullest extent possible by the law
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.180]   to, you know, collect rents anyways?
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.380]   Like, why are you keeping it as a parking lot?
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.220]   - Right, right, right.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.900]   So there's a lot of reasons.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.380]   And one of them has to do with,
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.660]   there's an image in the book
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.260]   that this guy put together for me.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.220]   I'll show it to you later.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.060]   But what it does is that it shows the rate of return.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.460]   What a land speculator is actually optimizing for
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.380]   is their rate of return, right?
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.020]   And so if land appreciates by 10% a year,
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.380]   you know, you're actually incentivized
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.860]   to invest in vacant land or a teardown property
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.380]   because the building of a teardown property
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.780]   is like worth negative value.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.100]   So the land's cheaper because there's garbage on it,
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.420]   you know?
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.300]   Then you are to necessarily invest in a property
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.860]   and you're basically, your marginal dollar
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.860]   is better spent on more land than it is on building up.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.100]   But eventually, shouldn't this be priced
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   into the price of land so that the returns
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   are no longer 10% or they're just like basically
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.820]   what you could get for any other asset?
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.900]   And at that point, then the rate of return
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.340]   is similar for building things on top of your existing land
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.220]   than buying new land.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.940]   'Cause like the new land is, like the,
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.340]   you know, that return has been priced into other land.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.940]   - Well, I mean, arguably, empirically,
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.780]   we just don't see that.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.660]   You know, we see rising land prices
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.020]   as long as productivity and population increases.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.340]   Those productivity and population gains
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.260]   get soaked into the price of the land.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.780]   It's because of this phenomenon
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.380]   called Ricardo's Law of Rent.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.660]   And it's been pretty empirically demonstrated
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.260]   that basically, and it has to do with the negotiation power,
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.500]   but like why, some people do, of course,
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.500]   build and invest, you know.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.420]   There's a lot of local laws that restrict
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.260]   people's ability to build.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.300]   But another reason is just like,
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.180]   it also has to do with the existing,
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.700]   part of it, part of the effect is partially
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.140]   the existing property tax regime
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.660]   actively incentivizes empty lots
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.340]   because you have a higher tax burden if you build, right?
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.780]   So what actually happens is a phenomenon
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.460]   that's similar to oil wells, right?
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.620]   You have, it's not just 'cause of property taxes.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.500]   Those do encourage you to keep it empty.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.820]   But there's this like,
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.540]   there's this phenomenon called land banking
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.780]   and waiting for the land to ripen, right?
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.060]   Sure, I could build it now,
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.340]   but I might have a lot of land parcels I've got.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.900]   And I don't need to build it now
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.860]   because I think the prices might go up later
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.700]   and it would be better to build on it later
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.020]   than it is now.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.180]   And it's not costing me anything to keep it vacant now.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.820]   If I build now, I'm gonna have to pay
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.340]   a little bit more property taxes.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.980]   And I know in three years
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.980]   that the price is gonna be even better.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.420]   So maybe I'll wait to incur those construction costs then.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.620]   And right now I'm gonna focus more on building over here.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.780]   And like, I've got a lot of things to do, you know,
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.860]   so I'm just gonna squat on it here.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.380]   It's the same way like I have,
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.580]   I'm squatting like, you know, to my shame,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.780]   like about 30 domain names, you know,
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.180]   most of them bought before I kind of got onto Georgism.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.220]   And it's like, yeah, I'll pay 15 bucks a year
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.300]   to just hold it, why not?
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.220]   I might use that someday.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.060]   - Right.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.220]   - And it's like, I should probably release
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.580]   all the ones I have no intent of using
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.460]   because I was looking for a domain
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.620]   for my startup the other day
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.700]   and every single two word .com is taken.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.540]   - Right, right.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.300]   - And has been for like 10 years, you know,
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.460]   and it's a similar phenomenon.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.300]   It's just, it's like,
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.140]   some of it is economic, rational, following of incentives.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.540]   And some of it is just, it's like,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.980]   well, this is a good asset.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.900]   I'm just gonna hold onto it 'cause why not?
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.020]   And no one is, and I don't have any pressure
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.540]   to build right now.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.780]   And this happens on the upswing
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.740]   and on the downswing of cities.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.140]   So while the population is growing
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.100]   and while the population is declining,
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.340]   people will just buy a lot of land
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.180]   and hold it out of use
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.020]   'cause it's also just a great place to park money
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.660]   because it's an asset that, you know,
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.540]   if the population ever starts growing,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.140]   it's gonna keep its value better
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.060]   than almost any other hard asset you have.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.900]   - Yep, yep.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.980]   I guess another like broader criticism
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.420]   of this way of thinking is,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.420]   listen, this is all,
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.180]   and sorry for using these like podcast lingo
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.580]   of scarcity mindset,
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.660]   but this is all like scarcity mindset of,
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.660]   you know, land is limited.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.660]   But why don't we just focus on the possibility
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.780]   of expanding the amount of usable land?
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.900]   I mean, there's like not really a shortage of land in US.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.700]   Maybe there's a shortage of land in urban areas.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.980]   But you know, why don't we like expand into the seas?
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.500]   And why don't we expand into the air and space?
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.140]   Why are we thinking in this sort of scarce mindset?
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.980]   - Right, okay.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.940]   So I love this question
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.500]   because actually our current status quo mindset
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.900]   is a scarcity mindset.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.700]   And Georgism is the abundance mindset, right?
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.420]   And we can have that abundance
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.940]   if we learn to share the land,
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.340]   because right now, you know, why don't we expand?
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.940]   And the answer is we've tried that.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.900]   We've done it twice.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.180]   And it's the story of America's frontier, right?
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.020]   And so like right now,
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.500]   there's plenty of empty land in Nevada,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.420]   but nobody wants it.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.020]   And you have to ask why, right?
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.060]   You also have to ask the question
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.820]   of how did we have virtual housing crises in the metaverse
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.620]   where they could infinitely expand all they want?
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.180]   Like, how is that even possible?
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.780]   You know, and the answer has to do
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.940]   with what we call the urban agglomeration effect.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.100]   What's really valuable is human relationships,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.580]   proximity to other human beings,
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.460]   those dense networks of human beings.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.460]   And so the idea is not necessarily that like,
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.380]   in a certain sense,
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.300]   the issue is that land is not an indistinguishable,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.460]   fungible commodity.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.900]   Location really matters.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.540]   America has a finite amount of land,
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.940]   but it might as well be an infinite plane.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.820]   We're not gonna fill up every square inch of America
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.180]   for probably thousands of years, if we ever do, right?
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.940]   But what is scarce is specific locations.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.140]   They're non-fungible, you know?
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.220]   And to a certain extent, it's like, okay,
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.060]   if you don't wanna live in New York,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.700]   you can live in San Francisco or any other big city.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.780]   But what makes New York, New York is non-fungible.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.140]   What makes San Francisco, San Francisco is non-fungible.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.660]   That particular cluster of VCs in San Francisco,
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.580]   until or unless that city completely explodes
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.700]   and that moves somewhere else to Austin or whatever,
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.900]   at which point Austin will be non-fungible.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.180]   I mean, Austin is non-fungible right now.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.660]   And so the point is that the way Georgism
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.780]   unlocks the abundance mindset,
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.380]   let me talk about the frontier.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.340]   We have done frontier expansion.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.500]   That is why immigrants came over from Europe,
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.460]   and then eventually the rest of the world,
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.500]   to America to settle the frontier.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.020]   And the losers of that equation were, of course,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.100]   the Indians who were already here and got kicked out.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.620]   But that was the original idea of America.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.780]   And I like to say that America's tragedy,
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.820]   America's problem is that America is a country
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.900]   that has the mindset of being a frontier state,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.740]   but is in fact a state which has lost its frontier.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.940]   And that is why you have these conversations
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.580]   with people like boomers who are like,
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.580]   why can't the next generation just pull itself up
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.460]   by its bootstraps?
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.780]   Because America has had at least,
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.780]   I would say two major periods of frontier expansion.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.700]   The first was the actual frontier, the West,
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.260]   the Oregon Trail, the covered wagons,
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.020]   the displacement of the Indians.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.260]   And so that was a massive,
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.940]   that was a time in which Henry George's writing
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.940]   was right when that frontier was closing, right?
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.820]   When all that land, that free land was being taken,
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.340]   and the advantages of that land
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.860]   was now being fully priced in.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.180]   That is what it means for a frontier to close,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.020]   is that now the good productive land,
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.300]   the value of it is fully priced in.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.180]   When the frontier is open,
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.300]   you can just go out there and take it,
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.460]   and you can get productive land
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.020]   and realize the gains of that.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.020]   And the second frontier expansion
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.740]   was after Henry George's death,
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.460]   was the invention of the automobile.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.420]   The ability to have a job in the city,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.100]   but not have to live in the city.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.660]   The fact that you could quickly travel in,
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.300]   like I commuted in to visit you here, right?
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.180]   That is because of the automobile frontier opening
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.780]   that has allowed me to live in some other city,
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.100]   but be able to do productive work like this podcast
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.380]   by driving in.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.420]   But the problem is, sprawl can only take you so far
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.260]   before that frontier as well closes.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.900]   And by closes, I don't mean suburban expansion stops.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.700]   What I mean is that now, suburban homes,
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.100]   you fully price in the value
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.660]   of the benefits you're able to accrue
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.660]   by having that proximity to a city,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.580]   but still being able to live over here
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.340]   through, of course, Ricardo's law for rent.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.780]   - Yeah, but I feel like this is so compatible
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.380]   with the story of we should just focus
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.660]   on increasing technology and abundance
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.140]   rather than trying to estimate how much rent
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.700]   is available now given current status quo technologies.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.180]   I mean, the car is a great example of this,
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.140]   but imagine if there were like flying cars, right?
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.300]   Like there's a, you know, where's my flying car?
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.620]   There's like a whole analysis in that book about,
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.860]   you know, if you could,
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.460]   if people are still commuting like 20 minutes a day,
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.500]   you know, a lot more land is actually
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.860]   in the same travel distance as it was before.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.780]   And then now all this land would be worth as much,
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.140]   even in terms of relationships
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.860]   that you could like accommodate, right?
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.380]   So why not just build like flying cars
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.060]   instead of focusing on land rent?
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.980]   - Well, because these things have a cost, right?
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.260]   The cost of frontier expansion
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.300]   was murdering all the Indians
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.660]   and the cost of automobile expansion was climate change.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.180]   You know, there has to be a price for that.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.620]   And then eventually the problem is you eventually,
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.460]   when you get to the end of that frontier expansion,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.460]   you wind up with the same problem
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.540]   we had in the first place.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.500]   Eventually the problem is the first generation
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.220]   will make out like gangbusters
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.260]   if we ever invent flying cars,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.620]   even better like Star Trek matter teleporters.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.260]   You know, that'll really do it.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.380]   Then you can really live in Nevada
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.860]   and have a job in New York.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.380]   There are some people who claim that Zoom is this,
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.220]   but it's not.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.500]   You know, we've seen the empirical effects of that.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.500]   And it's like, it's the weakest like semi frontier we've had
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.740]   and it's already closed.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.380]   Because of Zoom,
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.780]   houses like this over in Austin have gone up in value
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.620]   because there is demand for them.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.340]   There's demand for people to telecommute.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.620]   And so anyone who has,
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.460]   so the increased demand for living out in the suburbs
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.340]   is now basically priced in because of the Zoom economy.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.220]   And so the thing is the first people who did that,
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.340]   who got there really quick,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.060]   the first people to log into the Ultima Online server
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.540]   were able to claim that piece of the frontier
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.220]   and capture that value.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.180]   But the next generation has to pay more in rent
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.020]   and more in home prices to get that.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.860]   - Actually, that raises
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.780]   another interesting criticism of Georgism.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.820]   This is actually a paper from Zachary Gauchanar
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.300]   and Brian Kaplan,
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.420]   where it was titled "The Surtheoretic Critique of Georgism."
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.220]   And the point they made was one of these,
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.020]   like one way of thinking about the improvement to land
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.780]   is actually identifying that this land is valuable.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.860]   Maybe because you do realize it has like an oil well in it.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.540]   Maybe you realize that it's like the perfect proximity
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.020]   to these like Chinese restaurants
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.060]   and this mall and whatever.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.500]   And then just finding which land is valuable
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.780]   is actually something that takes capital
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.140]   and also takes, you know,
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.180]   like you deciding to upend your life and go somewhere,
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.020]   you know, like all kinds of effort.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.220]   And that is not factored into the way
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.340]   you would conventionally think of the improvements to land
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.180]   that would not be taxed, right?
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.580]   So in some sense, you getting that land is like a subsidy
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.900]   for you identifying that the land is valuable
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.540]   and can be used to protect events.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.380]   - Right, yeah.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.220]   So I've read that paper.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.660]   So first of all, the first author of that,
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.980]   Zachary Gouchner.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.820]   - Yeah.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.300]   - I've not been able to pin him down
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.180]   on what exactly he meant on this,
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.260]   but he's made some public statements
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.620]   where he's revised his opinion since writing that paper
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.700]   and that he's much more friendly
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.820]   to the arguments of Georgism now
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.980]   than when he first wrote that paper.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.580]   So I'd like to pin him down
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.700]   and see exactly what he meant by that,
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.100]   'cause it was just a passing comment.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.820]   But as regards Kaplan's critique,
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.020]   Kaplan's critique only applies to a 100% LVT
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.900]   where you fully capture all of the land value tax.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.980]   And the most extreme Georgists I know
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.940]   are only advocating for like an 85% land value tax.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.780]   - Right.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.620]   - That would still leave,
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.980]   and Kaplan doesn't account at all
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.860]   for the negative effects of speculation.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.500]   He's making a speculation is good actually argument.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.460]   And even if we grant his argument,
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.460]   he still needs to grapple
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.060]   with all the absolutely empirically observed problems
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.540]   of land speculation.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.220]   And if we wanna make some kind of compromise
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.820]   between maybe speculation
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.100]   could have this good discovery effect,
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.780]   there's two really good answers to that.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.820]   First, just don't do 100% LVT,
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.940]   which we probably can't practically do anyway
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.460]   because of natural limitations,
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.420]   just empirically, you know, in the signal.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.580]   It's like you don't wanna,
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.940]   you don't wanna do 115% land value tax.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.380]   That drives people off the land.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.780]   So we wanna make sure that we like
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.100]   have a high land value tax,
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.740]   but make sure not to go over.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.980]   And so that would leave a sliver of land rent
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.620]   that would still presumably incentivize this sort of thing.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.500]   There's no argument for why, you know,
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.340]   100% of the land rent is necessary
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.660]   to incentivize the good things
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.740]   that Kaplan was talking about.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.220]   The second argument is when he talks about oil,
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.100]   well, we have the empirical evidence
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.660]   from the Norwegian massively successful petroleum model
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.100]   that shows in the case of natural resources,
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.980]   how you should deal with this.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.380]   And what Norway does is that they have a massive,
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.380]   massively huge severance tax on oil extraction.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.020]   And according to Kaplan's argument,
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.060]   this should massively destroy the incentive
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.700]   for companies to go out there and discover the oil.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.380]   And empirically, it doesn't.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.020]   Now, what Norway does is that they figured out,
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.420]   okay, so the oil companies,
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.380]   their argument is that we need the oil rents, right?
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.540]   We need these oil rents or we will not be incentivized
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.420]   for the massive capital costs of offshore oil drilling.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.260]   Well, Norway's like, well,
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.540]   if you just need to cover the cost of offshore oil drilling,
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.700]   we'll subsidize that.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.660]   We'll just pay you.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.860]   We'll just pay you to discover the oil.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.700]   But when you find the oil,
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.260]   that oil belongs to the Norwegian people.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.820]   Now, you may keep some of the rents,
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.420]   but most of it goes to the Norwegian people.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.780]   But hey, all your R&D is free.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.860]   All your discovery is free.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.380]   If the problem is discovery, we just subsidize discovery.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.660]   And then the oil companies are like,
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.100]   okay, that sounds like a great deal.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.740]   We don't have to.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.100]   Because without that, what the oil companies do
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.780]   is that they're like, okay, we're taking all these risks.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.020]   So I'm gonna sit on all these oil wells
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.420]   like people sitting on domain names
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.540]   because I might use them later.
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.180]   And the price might go up later.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.620]   But now, because there's a huge severance tax,
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.140]   you're forced to drill now.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.380]   And your actual costs of discovery and R&D
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.500]   and all those capital costs are just taken care of.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.180]   - But isn't there a flip side to that where,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.860]   I mean, one of the economic benefits of speculation,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.940]   obviously there's drawbacks,
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.660]   but one of the benefits is that
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.620]   it gets rid of the volatility in prices
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.660]   where a speculator will buy when it's cheap
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.460]   and sell when the price is high.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.340]   And in doing so,
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.580]   they're kind of making the asset less volatile over time.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.260]   And if you're basically going to tell people
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.620]   who have oil on their land,
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.700]   like we're gonna keep taxing you
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.540]   if you don't take it out,
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.180]   you're gonna keep getting taxed.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.860]   You're encouraging this massive glut of a finite resource
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.900]   to be produced immediately,
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.940]   which is bad if you think we might need
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.060]   that reserve in the ground 20 years from now
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   or 30 years from now when oil reserves are running low.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.380]   - Necessarily.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:15.220]   And so the problem is that speculation
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.180]   in the sense you're talking about,
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.580]   of like encouraging people to do arbitrage
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.980]   is good for capital because we can make more capital.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.980]   But we can't make more land,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.900]   we can't make more non-renewable natural resources.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.100]   And the issue empirically,
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.060]   and I just think the evidence
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.820]   just doesn't support that empirically
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.980]   because if anything,
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.540]   land speculation has causes land values
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.540]   to just constantly increase,
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.820]   not to find some natural part,
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.140]   especially with how easy it is to finance.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.820]   Two thirds of bank loans just chase real estate up.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.140]   And that's just like,
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.260]   if you just look at the history of the prices
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.020]   of residential real estate in America,
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.980]   it's like, it's not the cyclical graph
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.460]   where it like keeps going back down.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.300]   It keeps going back down,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.500]   but it keeps going up and up and up
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.660]   just on a straight line along with productivity.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.940]   And it underlines and undergirds major issue,
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.780]   everything that's driving our housing crisis,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.780]   which then undergirds so much of inequality
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.620]   and pollution and climate change issues.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.900]   And so with regards to speculation,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.660]   it's like, even if I just bite that bullet,
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.580]   it's like, okay, speculation is good actually.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.860]   I don't think anyone's made the case
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.260]   that speculators need to capture 100% of the rents
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.140]   to be properly incentivized to do anything good
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.540]   that comes out of speculation.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.580]   I think at some small reasonable percentage,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.100]   five to 10% of the rents, maybe 15 if I'm feeling generous,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.660]   but I don't think anyone's empirically made the case
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.700]   that it should be 100%, which is more or less the status quo.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.380]   - I mean, with regards to that pattern
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.580]   of the fact that the values tend to keep going up
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.100]   implies that there's nothing cyclical
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.660]   that the speculators are dampening.
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.780]   - Well, there are cycles to be sure,
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.460]   but it's not like it's something that resets to zero.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.940]   - Yeah, but that's also true of like the stock market,
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.500]   over time that goes up,
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.260]   but speculators are still have like an economic role
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.100]   to play in the stock market of making sure prices are.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.980]   - I mean, the difference is that people are now paying
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.020]   an ever-increasing portion of their incomes
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.380]   to the land sector, and that didn't used to be the case.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.340]   And if it keeps going, it's gonna be,
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.660]   I mean, you have people who are now paying
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.260]   50% of their income just for rent,
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.020]   and that's not sustainable in the longterm.
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.260]   You're going to have,
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.540]   the cycle you have there is revolution, you know?
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.300]   You, no, I'm serious.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.780]   Like what happens is like you look through history,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.580]   you either have land reform or you have revolution.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.540]   And you know, it's either like,
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.460]   either you have a never-ending cycle
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.460]   of transfers of income from the unlanded to the landed,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.980]   and eventually the unlanded will not put up with that.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.620]   You know, there was a real chance in the 19th century,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.340]   at the end of the 19th century of America
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.700]   going full on socialist or communist,
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.420]   and the only thing that saved us,
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.900]   and George's argument was like,
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   it's either Georgism or communism.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.620]   And if you want to save capitalism
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.740]   and not go totalitarian, we need Georgism.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.220]   And then what George failed to anticipate
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.420]   was of course the automobile.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.460]   And the automobile kicked the can down another generation,
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.260]   another couple generations, right?
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.060]   And it came at the cost of sprawl.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.620]   And that made everyone feel like we had solved the issue,
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.220]   but basically we just,
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.300]   and the costs of sprawl are enormous
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   in terms of pollution and poor land use.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.140]   Just look at Houston right now, right?
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.860]   But now we've come at the end of that frontier,
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.940]   and now we're at the same question.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.500]   And it's like, you see this resurgent interest
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.940]   in leftism in America, and that's not a coincidence, right?
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.540]   Because the rent is too damn high,
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.220]   and poor people and young people feel really,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.180]   really shoved out of the promise and social contract
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.460]   that was given to their parents.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.300]   And they're jealous of it,
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.660]   and they're wondering where it went.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.140]   Actually, you just mentioned that a lot of bank loans
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.860]   are given basically so you can get a mortgage
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.700]   and get a house.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.740]   It's like towards land.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.900]   There was an interesting question on Twitter
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.540]   that I thought was actually pretty interesting about this.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.620]   I can't find the name of the person who asked it,
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.700]   so sorry, I can't give you credit.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.060]   But they basically asked if that's the case,
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.380]   and if most bank loans are going towards
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.340]   helping you buy land that's artificially more expensive,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.220]   but now you implement a land value tax,
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.860]   and all these property values crash.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.700]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.540]   - Won't we see just a,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.420]   and then all these mortgages are,
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.820]   obviously, they can't pay them back.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.660]   - Right, right.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.660]   Are we gonna destroy the banking sector?
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.500]   - Exactly.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.860]   We'll have a Great Great Depression.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.380]   - Well, I mean, if you,
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.700]   okay, so this is kind of like,
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.020]   I mean, I'm not trying to compare landlords
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:25.860]   to slave owners or something,
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.180]   but it's like the South had an entire economy
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.180]   based off of slavery.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.700]   This thing that we now agree was bad, right?
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.460]   And it's like we shouldn't have kept slavery
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.820]   because the South,
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.060]   like it really disrupted the Southern economy
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.020]   when we got rid of slavery,
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.580]   but it was still the right thing to do.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.540]   And so, I mean, there is no magic button I could push
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.860]   as much as I might like to do so
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.780]   that will give us 100% land value tax
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.220]   everywhere in America tomorrow.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.860]   So I think in the actual path towards a Georgist future
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.540]   is gonna have to be incremental.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.540]   There'll be enough time to unwind all those investments
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.140]   and get to a more sane banking sector.
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.820]   So, I mean, like if we were to go overnight,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.060]   yeah, I think there would be some shocks
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.900]   in the banking sector,
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.100]   and I can't predict what those would be,
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.340]   but I also don't think that's a risk
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.700]   that's actually gonna happen
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.740]   because we just cannot make a radical change like that
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.420]   on all levels overnight.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.940]   - Yep, yep, yep.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.900]   Okay, so let's get back
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.020]   to some of these theoretical questions.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.980]   One I had was,
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.740]   I guess I don't fully understand
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.180]   the theoretical reason for thinking
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.180]   that you can collect arbitrarily large rents.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.180]   Why doesn't the same economic principle of competition,
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.220]   I get that there's not infinite landowners,
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.660]   but there are multiple landowners in any region, right?
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.020]   So if, for the same reason that profit is competed away
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.700]   in any other enterprise,
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.780]   if one landowner is extracting like $50 a profit a month
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.260]   and another landowner is extracting whatever, right?
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.340]   Like a similar amount, $50.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.580]   One of them, and they're both competing for the same tenant,
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.020]   one of them will decrease their rent
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.540]   so that the tenant will come to them
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.540]   and then the other one will do the same
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.660]   and the bidding process continues
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.060]   until all the profits are bidded away.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.140]   - Right, so this is Ricardo's Law Rent, right?
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.340]   And there's a section on it in the book
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.820]   with a bunch of illustrations you can show.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   And so the issue is that we can't make more land, right?
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.740]   And so you might be like,
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.900]   "Well, there's plenty of land in Nevada,"
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.740]   but the point is there's only so much land in Manhattan.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.540]   - But the people who have land in Manhattan,
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.940]   why aren't they competing against themselves or each other?
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.100]   - Right, well, what they do is because the nature
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.580]   of the scarcity of,
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.300]   there's only so many locations in Manhattan
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.980]   and there's so many people who wanna live there, right?
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.460]   And so all the people who wanna live there
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.060]   have to outbid each other.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.580]   And so basically,
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.900]   so let me give a simple agricultural example, model,
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.180]   and then I will explain how the agricultural model
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.140]   translates to a residential model.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.860]   Basically, when you are paying to live in an urban area
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.660]   or even a suburban area like here in Austin,
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.380]   what you're actually paying for
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.580]   is the right to have proximity
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.300]   to realize the productive capacity of that location.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   I.e., like, I wanna live in Austin
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.100]   because I can have access to a good job,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.500]   you know what I mean?
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.860]   Or whatever's cool about Austin,
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.700]   a good school, those amenities.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.700]   And the problem is you have to pay for those
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.100]   and you have to outbid other people
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.620]   who are willing to pay for those.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.060]   And Ricardo's Raw Rent says that the value of the amenities
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.900]   and the productivity of an area, as it goes up,
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.500]   that gets soaked into the land prices.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.740]   And the mechanism by that is that it's like,
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.500]   okay, say I wanna buy a watermelon, right?
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.180]   There's only one watermelon, we'll have to outbid that guy.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.620]   But the watermelon grower's gonna be like,
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.020]   oh, a lot of people want watermelons.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.500]   So next season, there's gonna be more watermelons
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   'cause he's gonna produce more watermelons.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.980]   But because there's only so many locations in Austin,
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.780]   you know, within the natural limits
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.140]   of our transportation network,
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.180]   basically, it forces the competition
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.220]   on the side of the people who are,
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.260]   of essentially the tenants, right?
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.340]   It forces us into one-sided competition with each other.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.580]   And that, and so there's an example of like,
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.100]   a simple agricultural example is like,
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.060]   okay, say there is a common field that anyone can work on,
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.420]   and you can make 100 units of wealth
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.340]   if you work on it, right?
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.100]   So, and there's another field
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.060]   that you can also earn 100 units of wealth in,
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.700]   but it's owned by a landowner.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.180]   Why would you go and work on the landowners
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.780]   when you're gonna have to pay 'em rent?
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.180]   You wouldn't pay 'em any rent at all,
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.860]   you would work on the field that's free.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.540]   But if the landowner buys that field,
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.620]   and now your best opportunity is a field
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.100]   that's only worth 10, a free field
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.900]   that will produce 10 units of wealth,
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.780]   now he can charge you 90 units of wealth,
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.580]   because you have no opportunity to go anywhere else.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.220]   And so basically, as more land gets bought,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.620]   and subject to private ownership in an area,
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.900]   landowners over time get to increase the rent,
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.820]   not to a maximum level, there are limits to it.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.460]   And the limits is what's called the margin of production,
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.620]   which is basically you can charge up to,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.500]   and this is where the competition comes in,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.820]   the best basic free alternative.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.100]   And that's usually, you can realize that geographically.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.260]   Out on the margins of Austin, there's marginal land
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.700]   that basically is available for quite cheap.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.500]   And it might be quite far away.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.540]   And it used to be not so quite far away 20, 30 years ago.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.580]   And so as that margin slowly gets privatized,
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.900]   landowners can charge up to that margin.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.780]   The other limit is subsistence.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.580]   They can't charge more than you're actually able to pay.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.740]   But the basic example is that,
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.580]   so this is why, this is how frontier expansion works.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.900]   When the entire continent's free,
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.420]   the first settler comes in, strikes a pick in the ground,
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.940]   keeps all of their wealth.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.060]   But as more and more of it gets consolidated,
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.060]   then landowners are able to charge proportionately more
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.780]   until they're charging essentially up to subsistence.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:56.060]   - Yeah, does that explain property values in San Francisco?
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.460]   I mean, they're obviously very high,
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.740]   but I don't feel like they're that high
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.980]   where the software engineers who are working at Google
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.540]   are living at subsistence levels.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.700]   Neither are they at the margin of production
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.860]   where it's like, this is what it would cost
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.940]   to live out in the middle of California
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.940]   and then commute like three hours to work or something.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.060]   - Right, well, so it has to do with two things.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.100]   So first of all, it's over the long run.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.980]   And so it's like, you've had a lot of productivity booms
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.260]   in San Francisco, right?
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.580]   And so it takes some time for that to be priced in,
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.940]   you know, and it can be over a while,
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.340]   but given a long enough time period,
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.540]   it'll eventually get there.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.060]   And then when we're talking about stuff,
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.340]   it's also based off of the average productivity.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.900]   The average resident of San Francisco
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.300]   is maybe not as productive as a high,
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.780]   like basically doesn't earn as high an income necessarily
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.420]   as a high income productive worker.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.220]   And so this means that if you are a higher than average
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.900]   productivity person, it's worth it to live
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.780]   in the expensive town because you're being paid more
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.380]   than the average productivity
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.420]   that's captured in rent, right?
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.300]   But if you're a low,
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.140]   if you're lower than average productivity,
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.020]   you flee high productive areas.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.460]   You go to more marginal areas
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.500]   'cause those are the only places
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.100]   you can basically afford to make a living.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:06.940]   - Okay, that's very interesting.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.820]   That's actually one of the questions
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.820]   I was really curious about.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.700]   So I'm glad to hear an answer on that.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   Another one is, so yeah, the idea is,
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.500]   you know, land is soaking up the profits
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.740]   that capitalists and laborers are entitled to
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.860]   in the form of rent.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.900]   But when I look at the wealthiest people in America,
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.260]   there, yeah, there's people who own a lot of land,
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.100]   but they bought that land after they became wealthy
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.220]   from doing things that were capital or labor,
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.020]   depending on how you define starting a company.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.180]   Like sure, Bill Gates owns a lot of land
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.140]   in Montana or whatever,
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.420]   but like the reason he has all that wealth to begin with
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.860]   is because he started a company, you know,
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.180]   that's like basically labor or capital,
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.020]   however you define it.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:43.980]   - Right.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.820]   - So how do you explain the fact
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.540]   that all the wealthy people are, you know,
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.620]   capitalists or laborers?
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.780]   - Well, so the thing is,
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   one of the big misapprehensions people have
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.340]   is that when they think of billionaires,
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.580]   they think of people like Bill Gates
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.540]   and Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.820]   Those are actually the minority billionaires.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.340]   Most billionaires are hedge funds,
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.220]   are people involved in hedge funds, you know, bankers.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.100]   And what are bankers?
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.660]   Most, what are two thirds of banks?
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.740]   It's real estate, you know?
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.980]   And so, but more to your point,
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.700]   like if I, if it is like, point that directly into it,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.220]   it's like, I don't necessarily have a problem
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.340]   with a billionaire existing, you know what I mean?
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.620]   If someone like genuinely like brings something new
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.100]   into the world and like, you know,
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.020]   I don't necessarily buy the narrative
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.780]   that like billionaires are solely responsible
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.300]   for everything that good that comes out of their company.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.820]   You know, I think they like to present that image,
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.180]   but I don't necessarily have a problem
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.780]   with a billionaire existing.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.300]   I have a problem with, you know, working class people
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.220]   not being able to feed their families, you know?
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.140]   And so like the greater issue is the fact
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.780]   that the rent is too high
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.540]   rather than that Jeff Bezos is obscenely rich.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.580]   - No, no, I guess my point wasn't that,
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.820]   like I'm not complaining that your solution
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.300]   would not fix the fact that billionaires exist.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.060]   I also like that there's billionaires.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.740]   What I'm pointing out is it's weird that if your theory
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:03.740]   of like where all the surplus in our society is getting,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.220]   you know, given away is that it's going to landowners
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.900]   and yet the most wealthiest people in our society
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.180]   are not landowners.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.020]   Doesn't that kind of contradict your theory?
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.460]   - Well, a lot of the wealthy people in our society
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.580]   are landowners, right?
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.140]   And it's just like, it's not the,
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:20.300]   so the thing is, is that basically making wealth off land
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.660]   is a way to make wealth without being productive, right?
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.060]   And so my point is, is that,
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.140]   so like you said in your interview with Glazer
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.700]   that it's like, okay, the Googleplex,
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.740]   like the value of that real estate is probably not,
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.420]   you know, compare that to like the market cap of Google,
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.540]   but now compare the value of all the real estate
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.980]   in San Francisco to the market caps
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.540]   of some of those companies in there, you know?
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.180]   Look at the people who are charging rent
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.780]   to people who work for Google.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.500]   That's where the money's actually going,
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.660]   is that, and, you know, investors talk about this,
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.460]   is that it's like, I have to like,
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:54.060]   if you earn $100,000 in San Francisco as a family of four,
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.500]   you are below the poverty line, right?
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.340]   You know, the money is going to basically
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.060]   upper middle-class Americans and upper-class Americans
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:08.060]   who own tons of residential land and are basically,
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.180]   and also the old and the wealthy especially,
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.060]   are essentially this entire class
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.140]   of kind of hidden landed gentry
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.580]   that are extracting wealth from the most productive people
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.900]   in America and young people especially.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.620]   And it creates really weird patterns,
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.060]   especially with like service workers
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.180]   who can't afford to live in the cities
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.780]   where their work is demanded.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.860]   - Yeah, okay, so what do you think of this take?
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.940]   This might be economically efficient.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.540]   In fact, I think it probably is economically efficient,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.820]   but the effect of a land value tax
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.820]   would be to basically shift our sort of societal subsidy
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.980]   away from upper middle-class people
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.860]   who happen to own land in urban areas
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.820]   and shift that to the super wealthy
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.700]   and also super productive people
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.540]   who like control the half an acre
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.260]   that Google owns in like Mountain View.
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.060]   So it's kind of like a subsidy, not subsidy,
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.700]   but it's easing the burden
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.940]   on super productive companies like Google
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.740]   and so that they can make even cooler products
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.180]   in the future.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.220]   But it is in some sense a little regressive.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.420]   You're going from upper middle-class
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.660]   to like tech billionaire.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.780]   - Right.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.220]   - But it's still be economically efficient to do that.
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.940]   - Well, no, I don't quite agree with that
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.260]   because it's like, although there are a lot
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.780]   of upper middle-class Americans
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.180]   who own a lot of the land wealth,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.540]   it's not the case that they own
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.340]   where the majority of the land wealth is.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.140]   The majority of the land wealth in urban areas
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.860]   is actually in commercial real estate.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.820]   Is the central business district if you,
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.500]   and I work in mass appraisal.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.780]   So I've seen this myself in the models we build
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.460]   is that if you look at the transactions in cities
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.700]   and then you plot where the land value is
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.460]   in like a graph, it looks like this.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.380]   And this is the city center
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.900]   and that's not a residential district.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.580]   So the residential districts are sucking up
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.140]   a lot of land value and the rent is too damn high,
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.500]   but the central business district,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.260]   and this even holds even in the age of Zoom,
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.100]   it's taken a tumble,
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.620]   but it's starting from a very high level.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.740]   That central residential, I'm not residential,
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.420]   but commercial real estate is super valuable.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.100]   Like an order of magnitude more valuable
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.900]   than a lot of the other stuff.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.060]   And a lot of it is very poorly used.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.540]   In Houston, especially, it's incredibly poorly used.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.980]   We have all these central parking lots downtown.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.740]   That is incredibly valuable real estate.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.340]   And just a couple of speculators are just sitting on it,
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.380]   doing nothing with it.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.780]   And that could be housing, that could be offices,
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.700]   that could be amenities,
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.220]   that could be a million sorts of things.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.900]   And so when you're talking about a land value tax,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.740]   those are the people who are gonna get hit first.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.580]   And those are people who are neither
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:39.580]   nice, friendly, upper middle class Americans,
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.660]   nor are they hardworking industrialists making cool stuff.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.540]   They're people who are doing literally nothing.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.140]   Now, if you do a full land value tax,
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.620]   yeah, it's gonna shift the burden on society somewhat.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.740]   But I feel that most analyses of property taxes
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.660]   and land value taxes that conclude that they are regressive,
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.980]   I think that's mostly done on the basis
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.940]   of our current assessments.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.100]   And I feel like our assessments
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.140]   could be massively improved.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.020]   And that if we improve the assessments,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.820]   we can show where most of our land value
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.940]   is actually concentrated.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.220]   And then we can make decisions about exactly,
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.100]   are we comfortable with these tax shifts?
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.020]   So a while back, I read this book, "How Asia Works."
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:19.860]   You must've been familiar with it.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.540]   - Yes, yes, I'm a fan.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.780]   - Yeah, and one of the things,
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.100]   I think Joseph Steadwell was the author.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.180]   One of the things he talks about is,
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.420]   so he's trying to explain why some Asian economies
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.260]   grew gangbusters in the last half of the 20th century.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.540]   And one of the things he points to
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.940]   is that these economies implemented land reform,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.460]   where basically, I guess, they redistributed land
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.700]   away from, I guess, the existing aristocracy and gentry
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.220]   towards the people who are working the land.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.700]   And while I was reading the book at the time,
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.780]   I was kind of confused because there's something
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:57.340]   called the Coasian, I forget the name of the argument.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.460]   Basically, the idea is, regardless of who initially
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.300]   starts off with a resource, the incentive of that person
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:07.860]   will be to, for him to give that resource
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   or lend out that resource to be worked
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.340]   by the person who can make most productive use of it.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:17.220]   And Steadwell was pointing out that these peasant farmers,
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.860]   basically, they will pay attention to detail
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.060]   of crop rotation and making the maximum use of this land
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.020]   to get the maximum produce.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.580]   Whereas if you're a big landowner,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.540]   you will just try to do something mechanized
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.300]   that's not nearly as effective.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.980]   And in a poor country, what you have is a shit ton of labor.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.700]   So you want something that's labor intensive.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.740]   Anyways, backing up a bit,
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.940]   I was confused while I was reading the book
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.180]   because I was like, well, wouldn't what you would expect
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.620]   to happen in a market, that basically,
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.820]   the peasants get a loan from the bank to work,
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.980]   to, I guess, rent out that land.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.900]   And then they are able to make that land
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.620]   work more productively than the original landowner.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.580]   Therefore, they are able to make a profit.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.180]   And everybody benefits, basically.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.060]   - Why isn't there a cosy solution to that?
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.660]   - Because any improvement that the peasants make to the land
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.780]   will be a signal to the landowner to increase the rent
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.980]   because of Ricardo's Law of Rent.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:05.820]   - Yep, okay.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.460]   - And that's exactly what happened in Ireland.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.060]   When, and George talks about this in "Progress and Poverty,"
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.420]   is that a lot of people were like,
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.540]   why was there famine in Ireland?
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.100]   It's 'cause the Irish are, you know, bad people.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.580]   You know, why didn't they, they're lazy.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.460]   Why didn't they improve?
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.580]   And it's like, because if you improve the land,
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.700]   all that happens is you still are forced
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.020]   into one-sided competition and the rent goes out.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.980]   - Yep, okay.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.860]   That makes sense.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.820]   Is the goal that the taxes you would collect
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.260]   with the land value tax,
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.020]   are they meant to replace existing taxes
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.980]   or are they meant to give us more services like UBI?
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.060]   'Cause they probably can't do both, right?
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.140]   Like, you either had to choose
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.620]   getting rid of existing taxes or--
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.180]   - Well, it depends how much UBI you want.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.340]   It's like, you can, you know, it's a sliding scale.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.940]   It's like, how many taxes do you want to replace
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.020]   versus how much, like, I mean, you can have a budget there.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.300]   It's like, if you can raise, you know,
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.940]   I show in the book the exact figures
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.380]   of how much I think land value tax could raise.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.380]   And I forget the exact figures,
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.980]   but like, you can pull up a graph and overlay it here of,
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.580]   you know, whether you're talking about the federal level
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.740]   or federal, local, and state, you know,
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.420]   there's $44 trillion of land value in America.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.860]   And I believe we can raise about 4 trillion
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.060]   in land rents annually with 100% land value tax.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.340]   And we would probably do less than that in practice.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.860]   But even on the low end,
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.620]   I forget what figure I quote for the low end.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.500]   Like, you could fully pay for any one of social security,
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.860]   Medicare plus Medicaid together.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.300]   So the second one is healthcare or defense
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.140]   entirely with the lowest estimate
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.020]   of what I think land rents could raise.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.180]   And then I think you can actually raise more than that
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.100]   because I think, and I give an argument in the book
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.220]   for why I think it's closer to like 4 trillion
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.580]   and that could pay for all three
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.700]   and have room over for a little bit of extra.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.140]   And so, I mean, it's up to you.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.420]   Like, that's a policy decision
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.260]   of whether you want to spend it on spending,
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.140]   whether you want to spend it on offsetting taxes
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.980]   or whether you want to spend it on UBI.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.820]   I think the best political solution,
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.420]   because like, if I bite the bullet
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.020]   that there might be some regressivity issues left over,
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.180]   you want to do what's called a UBI
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.500]   or what, you know, in George's time
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.580]   was called a citizen's dividend, right?
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.660]   You know, this will smooth over
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.580]   any remaining regressivity issues.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.860]   And then, but I very much am in favor
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.820]   of getting rid of some of these worse taxes.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.540]   You know, not just because they have deadweight loss
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.140]   and land value tax doesn't,
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.140]   but also because there's this tantalizing theory
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.620]   called ATCOR, all taxes come out of rent,
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.820]   which suggests that if you reduce other taxes,
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.540]   it increases land values,
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.540]   which means that if it's true in the strongest sense,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.620]   it means the single tax, right?
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.660]   Land value tax replace all taxes would always work.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.860]   And I'm not sure if I buy that,
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.260]   I want to see some empirical evidence,
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.540]   but I think at least some weak form of it holds
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:44.380]   so that when you offset other worse taxes,
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.740]   not only do you get rid of the deadweight loss from those,
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.020]   but you also wind up raising at least a little bit more
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.420]   in land value tax revenue.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.340]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.660]   I mean, as a libertarian,
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.060]   or I guess somebody who has like libertarian tendencies,
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.980]   my concern would basically be like,
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.620]   this obviously seems better than our current regime
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.900]   of taxing things that are good, basically,
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.180]   capital and income.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.820]   But my concern is the way I'm guessing
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.380]   something like this would be implemented
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.540]   is that it would be added on top of
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.220]   rather than repealing those taxes.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.740]   And then, so yeah, I guess like we would want to ensure--
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.580]   - I get this one a lot.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.340]   Yeah, no, and so I have, you know,
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.580]   I've been a libertarian in my past
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.380]   and I have a soft spot for libertarianism.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.660]   I used to be a Ron Paul guy
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.980]   and went back in the day for a hot minute.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.060]   And so I think the thing to assuage your concerns there
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.900]   is what is land value tax?
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.660]   It's property tax without a tax on buildings.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.340]   So the natural path to actually getting land value tax
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.460]   comes from reforming existing property tax regimes
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.820]   by reducing an entire category of taxation,
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.420]   which is the tax on buildings.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.100]   And so that's what I think is the most plausible way
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.220]   to get a land value tax, like in Texas here,
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.140]   if we were to start by just capture the same,
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.780]   like what I actually propose for a first step
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.540]   is not 100% land value tax federally.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.340]   I don't even know how you get to there.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.500]   I think what you actually do
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   is you start in places like Texas and like,
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.700]   here, legalize split rate property tax,
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.260]   that's where you tax buildings and land at separate rates,
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.140]   set the rate on buildings to zero,
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.220]   collect the same dollar amount of taxes.
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.220]   Let's start there.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.980]   There's proposals to do this in various cities
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.940]   around the nation right now.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.340]   I think there's one in Virginia.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.980]   There's a proposal to do it in Detroit.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.900]   I think there's some talk of it in Pennsylvania
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:25.740]   and some places.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.300]   And I'd like to see those experiments run
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.020]   and observe what happens there.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.540]   I think we should do it in Texas.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.060]   And that would be something that I think
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.980]   would be very friendly to the libertarian mindset
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.100]   because very clearly we're no new revenue, right?
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.740]   And we're exempting an entire category of taxation.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.660]   Most people are gonna see a savings on their tax bill
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.380]   and the people who own those parking lots
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.500]   downtown in Houston are gonna be paying most of the bill.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.660]   - Yeah, by the way, what do you make of,
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.700]   is there like a George's critique of government itself
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.900]   in the sense that government is basically
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.460]   the original land squatter
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.740]   and it's basically charging the rest of us rents
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:06.580]   or staying on rent that it's neither productively improving
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.780]   as much as at least it's like getting rents from us for.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.460]   Like, if you think about, you know, even your landlord
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.260]   usually is not charging you 40%,
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.380]   which is like what the income tax rate is in America, right?
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.460]   And it's like, almost, you can like view the America
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.820]   as like the landlord of America.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.740]   - Well, I mean, it's like, I mean,
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.340]   if you wanna take the full,
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.300]   like if you're asking is Georgism, you know,
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:30.300]   compatible with full anarcho-capitalist libertarianism,
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.860]   probably not 100%.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.740]   I think, you know, we can have a little government
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.660]   as a treat, but I think, you know,
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.780]   I think it's not a coincidence
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.100]   that if you look throughout America's founding,
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.980]   I don't think it's a coincidence that originally,
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.820]   like people talk about, it's like,
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.060]   oh, it used to be only white men who could vote.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.900]   White landowning men could vote,
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.540]   like a government by the landowners
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.340]   for the landowners of the landowners, right?
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.660]   And that's very much kind of the traditional English system
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:00.140]   of government, you know, just neo-feudalism, right?
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.340]   And so I think Georgism certainly has a critique of that,
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.980]   it's like government is often instituted
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.700]   to protect the interests of landowners.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.580]   But what's interesting is that
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.740]   if you look throughout history, you know,
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.140]   I'm very much a fan of democracy, you know,
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:14.980]   rule of the people.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.460]   And it's like, I think we, you know,
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:22.020]   I kind of sympathize with Milton Friedman here,
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.180]   where he's like, you know,
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.180]   he might want to have less government than we have now,
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.860]   but he doesn't believe we can have no government.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.660]   And then he goes on to endorse, you know,
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.580]   the land value tax is the least worst tax
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.420]   because income tax especially,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.660]   I feel like is a gateway drug to the surveillance state.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.340]   You know, one of the advantages of land value tax
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.500]   is you don't even care necessarily who owns the land.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.300]   You're just like, hey, 4732 Apple Street,
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.980]   make sure the check shows up in the mail.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.980]   I don't care how many shell companies in the Bahamas
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.820]   you've like obscured your identity with,
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.940]   just put the check in the mail, Mr. Address, you know?
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.820]   Whereas the income tax needs to do this full anal probe
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.460]   on everyone in the country.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.380]   And then audits the poor at a higher rate than the rich.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.580]   And it's just this horrible burden we have.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.500]   And then it gives the government
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.900]   this kind of presumed right to know what you're doing
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.060]   about everything you're doing,
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.100]   this massive invasion of privacy.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.740]   - Yeah, no, that's fascinating.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.740]   Speaking of shell companies in the Bahamas, by the way.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.580]   - Yes.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.620]   - There's this interesting speculation
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.260]   about what would happen if crypto really managed
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.220]   to divorce and private, I guess,
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.420]   make private your log of transactions or whatever.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.740]   And then I guess the idea is the only legible thing
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.980]   left to the government is land, right?
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.540]   So it would like force the government
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.020]   to institute a land value tax.
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.140]   'Cause like you can't tax income or capital gains anymore.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.420]   That's all on like the blockchain
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.380]   and like obscured in some way.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.420]   And yeah, yeah.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.860]   So I mean, is like crypto the gateway drug to Georgism?
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:53.980]   'Cause it'll just move income and capital to the other realm?
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.940]   - Yeah, it's just so weird.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.540]   I've gone on record as being a pretty big crypto skeptic,
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.380]   you know what I mean?
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.060]   But I have noticed a lot of crypto people
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:00.900]   get into Georgism.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.700]   I mean, not the least of which is Vitalik Buterin
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.420]   who endorsed my book, who's a huge fan of Georgism.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.300]   It's like, I mean, I'll take fans from anywhere,
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.180]   even from people I've had sparring contests with.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.780]   I'm generally pretty skeptical
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.660]   that crypto can fulfill all its promises.
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.260]   I am excited by those promises.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.500]   And if they can prove me wrong, that would be great.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.020]   And I think there's some logic to what you're saying
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.060]   is that if we literally couldn't track transactions,
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:29.420]   then I mean, I guess we don't have much to tax except land.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:30.940]   I don't think that'll actually come to pass
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.300]   just based off of recent events, you know?
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.780]   And that's basically my position on it.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.660]   But I have noticed a lot of crypto people
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.940]   just they're some of the easiest people
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.900]   to convince about Georgism,
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.580]   which was completely surprising to me.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.420]   But I've learned a lot by talking to them.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.660]   It's very interesting and weird.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.580]   So there were some other interesting questions from Twitter.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.420]   - Yeah.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:56.060]   - Ramon Dario Iglesias asks,
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.820]   how do you transition from a world today
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.220]   where many Americans have homes,
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.300]   or at least are aspiring to have homes,
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.580]   to a world where, I mean,
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.060]   obviously it would be like a different regime.
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.460]   They might still have homes, but who knows?
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.940]   Like their property will just be like,
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.660]   think about it in a completely different way.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.740]   How do you transition to that?
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.940]   Like, what would that transition look like
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.940]   for most Americans? - Right, right, right, right, right.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.380]   So there's this issue called, that I have to grapple with,
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.620]   which is called Gordon Tullock's
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.740]   transitional gains trap, right?
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.140]   So if you think about taxi medallions
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.220]   in like New York City, right?
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.340]   You know, it's like, it's this artificially scarce asset
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.580]   that allows you to operate a taxi, right?
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:30.660]   And the first generation that got their taxi medallions
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.140]   basically got in cheap,
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:35.660]   and then afterwards, like made out like gangbusters.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.260]   But the second generation had to buy those taxi medallions
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.380]   at the fully priced in value.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.580]   And now when you come in and you're like,
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.660]   okay, we're gonna abolish taxi medallions,
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.820]   if like, say you were gonna do that,
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.380]   you would screw over that entire second generation
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:48.780]   who bought in in good faith
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.700]   after the value of the asset had been fully priced in,
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.620]   even if you admit that the system is now unfair,
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.860]   removing that unfairness screws over the people
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:00.380]   who played by the quote unquote unfair rules, you know?
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:01.780]   So how do you grapple with that?
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.380]   And I think it's something that Georgists need to grapple
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.500]   with because we can't just imagine a future utopia
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.060]   without accounting for being fair to people
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.860]   who play by the rules, including people like myself,
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.220]   like I'm a homeowner, right?
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.100]   Am I intending to screw over myself and everyone like me?
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.340]   And so I think this is where it's really important
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.580]   to do the math of knowing exactly
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.020]   who's gonna be a winner, who's gonna be a loser,
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.340]   who's gonna pay more, who's gonna pay less.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.660]   I think it's really salient that a lot of the value of land
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.900]   is commercial downtown real estate.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.100]   And I think that a revenue neutral property tax shift
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.820]   to land where we exempt the taxation of all buildings,
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.940]   but collect the same amount in property taxes
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.500]   as we're doing now, but just from the land,
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.140]   and then a modest citizens dividend
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.460]   is a really good first step.
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.820]   And then over the years, you can raise the land value rate
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.980]   as you also decrease things like income tax and sales tax.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.060]   I think that's a transition that gets us there
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.460]   without really screwing anyone over.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.740]   And for any edge case, like a poor sympathetic widow
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:02.260]   who has no income, but has a high value home,
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.020]   you just make it so she doesn't have to pay
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.580]   the land value tax until she dies or sells the estate.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.060]   And like, I guess even in there,
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.300]   the worst case scenario is the status quo
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:15.220]   where they don't have to pay land value taxes,
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:16.860]   which is already the case now, right?
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.420]   - Right, I mean, nobody cares about the people
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.220]   who are being evicted and displaced by the status quo.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.460]   One, I guess, snafu in terms of figuring out
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.860]   how to price the land is by the time
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.540]   that a land value tax was passed,
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.020]   it'll have been years after this political talk
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:34.780]   of having a land value tax.
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:38.180]   And that talk will in turn affect the prices of homes
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.860]   that are sold in that time.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.980]   - Absolutely.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.260]   - And so then you'll look at the land selling value
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.580]   and be like, oh, wow, this house on the outskirts
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.620]   of San Francisco only sold for $200,000.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.260]   And does that mean that the unimproved land there
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.620]   is only worth $100,000?
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.660]   And so wouldn't that really conflate the data
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.260]   when you actually go about implementing this
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.500]   of what the actual unimproved land is worth?
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.100]   - Right, well, so it's important to remember
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.100]   that land selling value is derived from land rental value,
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.180]   not the other way around.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.060]   So land selling value is the net present value
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.860]   of the future flow of income that can be generated
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.780]   from the property.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.700]   So the property's inherent productivity
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.300]   is kind of inherent to it.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.420]   And the selling price of it is based off of
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.340]   the capitalization of that value
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.220]   minus the expectation of any taxes, right?
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.420]   And so a 100% land value tax will theoretically
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.240]   reduce the selling price to zero,
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.020]   but the land will still be as productive as it always was.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.140]   It's just that the flow of those rents
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.220]   are being redirected, right?
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.500]   And so that's the thing is that,
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.660]   and also in mass appraisal,
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.460]   one of the things you do is you decapitalize
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:52.060]   the effect of the tax.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.620]   - No, no, but I'm saying, how do you even figure out,
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.980]   you don't know in the mind of the property owner
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.220]   or the property seller,
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.220]   like what do they think the probability is of a tax?
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.020]   And that, since you don't know that,
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.420]   it's like hard to estimate what is the actual
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.460]   like capitalization value, you know, the rent value.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.540]   - Are you concerned about like the societal effects
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.260]   of the depreciation of land prices
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.140]   or are you more concerned about just the calculation issue?
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.980]   - The calculation issue.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.140]   - So here's the thing, empirically,
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:24.100]   if the land value, basically,
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.260]   if the land selling price has dropped to zero,
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.260]   then you are fully capturing all of the land rents.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.900]   And if it's above zero,
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.700]   you have not captured all of the land rents.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.740]   - Oh, okay, so like maybe in the first year
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.460]   you implement this, it's like not,
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.500]   you know, maybe you only implemented like a,
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.020]   you're like, basically in the first two years
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.740]   you implement this, you would like be trying
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.180]   to mess with the rate.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180]   - If it's like, it's like, I mean,
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.380]   it's more complicated than this,
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.500]   but if there's any vacant lots in the area
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.100]   and they're selling for anything,
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.500]   there's still land rent in that property.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.020]   - Gotcha, but so this is not something
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.140]   you would be able to figure out day one.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.940]   You would have to, like over a course of years
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.540]   of fudging the numbers.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.260]   - We're doing property tax assessments right now.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.380]   You know, we're doing mass appraisal
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.220]   all the time right now.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.940]   And if you just keep it updated every year,
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.140]   I mean, you could do it every six months
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.380]   if you had the right technology,
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.420]   which is something I'm pushing for, you know?
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.540]   And so you can see the prices change in real time
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.660]   as transactions come in and you can use
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.900]   multiple regression and geographic weighted regression
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.980]   to work out the difference between the improvements
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.380]   and the land prices.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:25.220]   And if you had a rental registry
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.700]   and knew what everyone was paying in rents,
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.780]   you'd be able to keep even better track
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.460]   on what's going on with that.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.620]   - Yeah, this might be actually a good point
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.500]   to talk about your new startup.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.980]   This is actually something I didn't know about either.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.460]   So yeah, what is the, what is the idea?
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.300]   What are you up to?
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.980]   - Right, so my new startup is, you know,
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.260]   so I'm transitioning out of video games
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:46.860]   and into municipal property tax assessment, mass appraisal.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.820]   And so my new startup,
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.180]   it's called Geoland Solutions for now.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.660]   We'll probably have a new name for it
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.460]   by the time that this podcast airs.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.300]   But the idea is that, you know,
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.940]   I think the best criticism to Georgism is, you know,
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.500]   well, how are you actually gonna separate land value
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.660]   from improvement, from building value, right?
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.980]   You know, how, like, we can't do a land value tax
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.740]   till we put a price on every parcel of land, right?
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.180]   So how are you going to do that?
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.660]   And I thought that was the best, most good faith,
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.980]   you know, criticism remained.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:18.820]   And it seemed like, it's like,
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.220]   well, we gotta get good at that, right?
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.260]   And so I looked into it and I realized
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.660]   that there was a lot of research papers
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.540]   that have been posted in the last 15 years
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.340]   about how to practically do this.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.860]   And then I went and I started interviewing
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.500]   a bunch of assessors and I realized
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.900]   that the state of the practice is pretty far behind.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.900]   Only 15% of most property tax assessment offices
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.380]   even use multiple regression.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.300]   A lot of them are using the cost approach,
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.820]   which is basically where you,
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.700]   it's what Ed Glazer talked about in your interview with him,
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.580]   where you estimate the cost of building
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.900]   and you apply depreciation and you subtract it
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.740]   from the observed selling price
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.220]   to get, you know, the assumed land price.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.140]   And that works okay, but a lot of assessment
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.660]   is not only using essentially only that method,
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:06.380]   but also another issue is that just
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.780]   a lot of those cost tables are very out of date.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.900]   Assessments themselves are not always done every year
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.940]   in some, it's not unheard of to find places
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.180]   that haven't done reassessments in,
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.140]   you know, more than 10 years.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.300]   Most places it's like, you know, one to five.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.860]   But even that, I think we should be doing
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.340]   everything we can to get all the latest
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.060]   mass appraisal technology and research.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.460]   And so we've hired some people who have,
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.300]   like I basically, one of our first hires
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.460]   was one of the guys who was just first author
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.340]   on all these papers we were reading.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.300]   And we're just here to update
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.260]   municipal property tax assessors on the latest methods
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.180]   so that we can accurately know
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.340]   what all the land in America is worth, you know?
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.820]   And then this will solve a lot of regressivity issues too,
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.060]   because we know that a lot of landlords
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.140]   are actually under assessed relative to homeowners,
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.540]   believe it or not, because they're more likely
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.820]   to protest their property taxes.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.860]   And minorities tend to be over-assessed
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.660]   and poor people tend to be over-assessed.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.700]   That's why property taxes are sometimes called regressive,
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.860]   is the assessments need to be fixed.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.700]   - I see.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.220]   I guess because if you have more property,
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.700]   getting your rate change from like 1% to 0.8%
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.780]   is like worth thousands of dollars
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.460]   rather than like hundreds of dollars.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.540]   - Right, and there's a lot of other issues too,
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.140]   is this is like, there's more value in like the more,
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.660]   there's all sorts of reasons that you can have these things,
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:40.060]   you know, often from no malintent whatsoever, right?
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.780]   You know, but just like just out of date assessments
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.220]   can also cause all sorts of issues.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.780]   I guess one worry that people might have is,
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.460]   listen, income taxing is like, you know,
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.500]   obviously very inefficient.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.380]   What is the, I think you in the book,
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.780]   we're talking about the percentage of income,
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.140]   that of taxed income,
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.900]   that is literally just spent on figuring out
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.460]   how much income tax to collect
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.100]   and whether people have paid or whatever.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.300]   So I get that, but at least it has this nice property of,
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.260]   there is like, it feels like there's this hard figure
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.460]   that ought to exist.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.540]   So like I made this much income this year,
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.300]   whereas figuring out how much land is worth,
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.580]   you know, just like, I get that it's basically like,
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.540]   yeah, if you, you know, figure it out,
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.180]   like the rent value, that's like the value of the land,
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.660]   but it just feels much more murky.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:30.220]   And therefore it might potentially enable corruption
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.540]   in the level of like, you know,
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.220]   like whoever's doing the assessment
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.940]   or however that method of assessment is happening.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.820]   They'll just like use these fancy algorithms
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.140]   to nudge it one way or another that benefits
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.780]   the corporations or, you know, whoever they want.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.260]   - So that's a really, that's a good argument.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.340]   But the reply to that is that
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.860]   we need to move towards more transparency, right?
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.620]   Because land value follows certain rules
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.940]   that should logically make sense, right?
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.500]   We know some things that drive locational value.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.780]   First of all, we should move towards open source models,
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.100]   right, which is something that we want to do
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.460]   and open data whenever possible.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.700]   A lot of these cities will post open data portals.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.460]   Like my mission in life is to be able to like,
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.820]   advance the state of the art of this technology
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.180]   and make it so anyone can kind of check on stuff.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.340]   You should be able to, in any city in America,
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.900]   some cities have this, but not enough.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.100]   You should be able to look up
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.900]   your property tax assessment on a map
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.180]   and compare it to your neighbor.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.500]   And what you shouldn't see is a Christmas tree effect
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.340]   where your neighborhood looks like Christmas tree lights
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.220]   of like green and red of people
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.980]   whose property tax assessments like massively differ.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.740]   That's the case in a lot of cities.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.500]   Like if the value, like if the land values
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.700]   have been correctly assessed in this neighborhood,
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.500]   most of these parcels should be about the same.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.060]   Like probably the cul-de-sacs worth a little bit more,
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.580]   you know, but like your prop,
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.860]   your neighbor's land shouldn't be worth 20% more than yours.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.700]   And if it is, it'll stick out on a map like a sore thumb.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.540]   And if the data and the algorithms
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.380]   are all open source and open data,
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.460]   you should be able to check anyone's math.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.780]   And you should be able to use that
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.420]   to then protest your taxes if they seem off.
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.100]   And that's kind of the argument for land value taxes
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:06.340]   is that, I mean, you can hide all kinds of stuff
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.140]   in income taxes and capital taxes.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.260]   I mean, that's what the Caymans and the Bahamas are for.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.780]   But if you want to, I mean, it's very easy
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.060]   to find people who are getting a break
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.020]   on their property taxes.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.420]   Like all this corruption, I'm not saying it won't happen,
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.620]   but it'll be very easy to see
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.660]   because you'll be able to see just this mansion
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.700]   that suddenly has this discontinuity on the land value map.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.020]   It's like, well, someone gave this person a break
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.940]   and maybe we should write an article
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.300]   in the local newspaper about this.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.660]   - Yeah, it'll be way better than how income taxes work
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.900]   where none of it's like open
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.820]   to potentially even the government itself, right?
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:45.300]   But okay, so another concern is that's fine
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.820]   for things that are like above ground and legible,
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:52.820]   but what about you find out through, I don't know,
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.260]   like some sort of surveying or whatever
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.180]   that this land has a lot of oil under it
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.340]   and then you buy it,
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.900]   but obviously you're not going to tell the government,
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.540]   "Hey, I just found like however many liters."
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.900]   - Oh, so this is the sort of theoretic critique and...
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.020]   - Or no, no, no, not even that.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.460]   It's literally like you won't declare it.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.500]   So in a sense, you're still being a speculator,
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.260]   but in fact, you're incentivized even more to be a speculator
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.460]   in the sense that as soon as you declare
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.300]   that there's oil underneath this ground,
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.580]   then the government is going to start taxing you for it.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:21.100]   So you just want to like hang on to that forever
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.300]   as long as you can keep it private.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.260]   - So we need to talk about mineral policy in America
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.660]   because especially in the state of Texas,
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.300]   like mineral rights and land rights
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.660]   are totally different, right?
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.580]   Usually when you buy land in Texas, in America,
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.620]   like you actually don't have the mineral rights.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.460]   - Oh, really, okay.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.260]   - Like those are very severable.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.860]   Like a lot of people are very interested
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:40.660]   in getting those mineral rights.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.060]   And so usually like if you're not paying attention,
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.940]   generally speaking, you're not getting the mineral rights
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.820]   when you're buying land.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.700]   And if you are, you're paying more for them.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.860]   And so, I mean, I think a good example of this
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:54.300]   is probably like, you know, you want to create some,
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.900]   I think with the case of minerals,
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.420]   you can't just have a full,
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:02.260]   I think as kind of an acknowledgement of Kaplan's
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.180]   like search theoretic thing,
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.980]   like you have something more like the Norwegian model
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:08.100]   where you need to basically give some incentive
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:13.100]   to someone to produce or to not withhold that resource,
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.860]   right?
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.300]   And so a good example would be the treasure,
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.340]   the treasure law in England,
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:19.700]   because England has all this ancient
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.820]   like Anglo-Saxon treasure and Roman treasure.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.300]   And so before what they would have is someone would find it
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.060]   and like go like hide it or melt it down
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.420]   'cause they didn't want the government to tax them.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.700]   And so they pass this treasure law,
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.500]   which is not perfect, but it's okay.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.620]   But they're like, this is our heritage, right?
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.820]   We want that in a museum.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.660]   So here's the deal.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:43.220]   If you find treasure, you're gonna get paid
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.820]   and the landowner's gonna get paid.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.460]   So there's an incentive for people to go out
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.500]   with metal detectors and there's an incentive
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.300]   for a landowner to let people do that.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.260]   And then the government's gonna put it in a museum.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.140]   You know, you're gonna be rewarded
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.580]   for the discovery of that thing.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:01.060]   But that thing is itself, its value is gonna be captured
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.340]   because it's the heritage of the British people.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.940]   The opposite of this is the Spanish government.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.940]   Whenever someone finds a ship full of,
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.980]   a galleon full of gold doubloons
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.620]   on the bottom of the ocean,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.460]   if you go and you invest the capital
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.460]   to bring that up to the surface,
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.940]   you know, and you're in Spanish waters
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.260]   or the Spanish government finds you,
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.900]   or you like take it not to Spain,
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.900]   a Spanish admiralty court is gonna try
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.780]   to get its claws on that gold.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.220]   In the view of the Spanish government,
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.500]   like basically the incentives they're producing
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.020]   is to make sure that nobody ever, ever recovers a ship.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:33.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.700]   Or if they do, it just ends up in some sort of like,
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.700]   you know, foundry in another country.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.540]   - Right, right, right.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.420]   The Spanish government's approach to sunken treasure
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.900]   basically incentivizes people never to go after.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.740]   - Yeah.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.020]   I guess a general critique of Georgetown in general
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.820]   or implementing it would be,
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.300]   listen, the reason America is wealthy
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.420]   and other developed countries are wealthy
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.860]   is because they are very strong
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.100]   in terms of honouring contracts,
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.260]   especially honouring people with property rights.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:06.260]   And, you know, if we get to a scenario
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.140]   where the government is saying,
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.900]   okay, but in this like case, we're going to,
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.580]   I mean, I guess it depends on how you think
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:12.780]   about the contract of property.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.340]   But in some sense, it's a contract of the government
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.700]   that like, hey, I have this property.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.540]   And once you don't honour that,
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.460]   like the people will get too concerned
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.060]   to want to invest in America or in American assets.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.820]   And that'll just have like all kinds
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.580]   of economic repercussions where people are like,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.740]   oh, I guess like my property is not mine.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.820]   Maybe like other things I thought I was investing in,
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.980]   like my stocks are not mine.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.700]   So why should I buy these stocks in America?
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.060]   - This is a fully general argument against change.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.540]   And it also is like,
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.700]   I don't agree with all the assumptions.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.020]   Like, you know, if America doesn't honour its agreements,
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:45.860]   what are they worth?
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.220]   Well, we've violated all kinds of treaties,
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.940]   not like with the Indians especially,
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.060]   but also like all sorts of international treaties.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:59.060]   And, you know, I mean, like we've made all kinds of times
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:03.260]   where we've like changed rules on things
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:04.820]   and changed asset classes.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.420]   You know, we had an entire period
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.940]   where we just banned all sales of alcohol.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.820]   And then we had a time where we completely undid that
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:12.700]   and brought it all back.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.660]   You know, there's been times where we've like made
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.780]   major, major changes to the rules
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:20.580]   of what kind of asset classes we have.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.740]   I mean, this is kind of like brought up with like,
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.500]   you know, any kind of like labour protections and things
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:30.500]   is, you know, is it's like, well, we have these rules
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.100]   and therefore we can never change them.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.140]   And I think the best answer to this is that
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.420]   you need to acknowledge Gordon Tolick's
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:38.420]   transitional gains trap.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.140]   And if there's someone who's going to be, you know, put out
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.100]   then you make sure that there's some compensation
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.460]   in the system to smooth over the transition.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:51.460]   But the rule of law doesn't imply that any change
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.220]   to the status quo is gonna undermine trust in it.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.180]   And I don't think that, and I think it's important
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.940]   to remember that George is not interested in seizing land.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:05.420]   That's a very big distinction from the Maoist position
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.940]   which is murder the landlords
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.260]   or the more like modest Asian reforms.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.860]   Asian reforms, it's like, we're just gonna.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.820]   So first of all, when you're talking about how Asia works,
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.220]   like they took the land away from the big landowners,
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.380]   gave it to the peasants and it made those countries
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.140]   way more productive, right?
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.900]   And like, I don't think anyone would like look
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.900]   at those Asian countries now and compare them
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.860]   to where they were and be like, well, the rule of law
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.980]   is weaker now than it used to be.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.060]   But George isn't even advocating for that.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.100]   He's just advocating for raising taxes on land
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.780]   and exempting all of the building taxes.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:38.060]   So I don't think it amounts to seizure of land.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.980]   And I think for those reasons,
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.820]   but even if it did amount to that,
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.180]   I think sometimes it's worth biting some bullets.
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.340]   Okay, let's move on to the dessert.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.100]   Let's move on to some more fun interpretations
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.340]   and applications of Georgism.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.180]   - Sure.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:58.220]   - So one, I think Bernhobart had this blog post on the def.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.300]   I don't know if you follow anyways,
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.900]   but he's like a great finance writer.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.580]   And he was talking about how,
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.900]   if you have a Facebook account or a YouTube channel
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.140]   with like millions of subscribers,
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.980]   you're in some sense,
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.500]   like you were like very early to YouTube or Facebook
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.660]   and now you have this land.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.180]   And Facebook punishes you if you have a big account,
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.300]   but are not posting frequently
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.420]   or not getting enough engagement.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.060]   That'll like in the future,
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.340]   you'll have a harder time reaching people.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:31.140]   And Bernhobart had this like Georges interpretation of that,
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.100]   where it's like you have this productive asset
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.300]   of people's attention,
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.060]   like this initial sort of profile
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.740]   that you're able to build in the early days of Facebook.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.620]   If you're not like posting on it,
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.900]   we're not gonna give you the advantage
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.740]   of having millions of buys.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.220]   But anyway, so there's all kinds of like ways
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.500]   you can apply Georgism to,
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.020]   you can think of like the app store
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.980]   as this sort of like rent seeking from Apple
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.820]   where they charge you with 30% tide.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.580]   And yeah, there's all kinds of other places
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.700]   in the digital world where I can think of this.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.580]   Like what is your sort of like,
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.660]   how do you think about Georgism
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.220]   in the context of those kinds of things?
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.620]   - Right, so I've actually written a policy paper
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.700]   on how to apply the theories of land value tax
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.780]   to virtual worlds.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.660]   And so the question is virtual real estate
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.220]   is when does something actually operate
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.860]   like a land like asset?
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:21.860]   And then to what extent does Georges principles apply?
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.860]   And that doesn't necessarily mean just do LVT.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.700]   It means that, so first of all,
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.180]   let me define what I mean by a land like asset.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.340]   A land like asset has three properties.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:34.300]   It is scarce in supply, it is necessary for production,
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.220]   and it obtains locational value
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:41.220]   by virtue of its position in some kind of graph, right?
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.180]   And so as an example, I create like a fictional MMO
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.900]   and I give the example of a unicorn,
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.980]   a permit and a plot of land.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.620]   The unicorn is scarce,
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.740]   but it's not necessary for production.
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.220]   Any value you could get from the unicorn,
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.060]   you could get some other way.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.220]   It's just really nice to have.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.060]   And there's only like 10,000 on the server.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.300]   A permit is like a permit to brew potions.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.860]   You're part of the witches guild.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.140]   You can brew potions.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.860]   So like my apprentice witch,
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:07.740]   she has to pay rent to me to gain access to my permit
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.180]   to be allowed to brew potions,
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.900]   but all permits are fungible.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.740]   So there's no locational value.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.940]   And then a plot of land, right?
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.060]   Like we've talked about where you can also,
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.900]   and so this becomes the real speculative asset.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.340]   Domain names are probably the closest thing to this.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.700]   And Vitalik Buterin has actually written a post
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:27.420]   about how to apply George's theory to domain names
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.340]   and also all the wrinkles that are involved.
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.140]   - By the way, he did this on your blog, right?
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.460]   As a guest post?
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.780]   - Well, progressandpoverty.substack.com
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.020]   is not technically my blog.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:39.420]   It's a group blog where a lot of us, Georges, post.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:42.260]   But so yeah, so my blog in the sense of our blog, sure.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.260]   And he cross-posted it.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.100]   He posted it also on his own blog.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.700]   And so, but there's other considerations to remember
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:51.260]   when we go away from literal land is like,
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.980]   so for instance, in domain names,
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.060]   especially with the Ethereum name system,
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.540]   you have issues of identity, right?
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.740]   That don't apply, like if someone buys this house from you,
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.540]   probably people aren't gonna be,
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.540]   like maybe the next person who lives here
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.980]   is gonna get some of your mail for like a week or two,
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.660]   but like no one's gonna think that they're you necessarily.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.780]   But if I buy vitalik.eth,
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.580]   like there might be some confusion.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.460]   Like I might be able to get some transactions
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.580]   that were meant for him.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.660]   And so there's these other considerations to like,
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.420]   and he deals with all of that.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.900]   And so I wrote a policy paper
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.540]   about how to apply LVT in virtual worlds and stuff.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:31.500]   That was more in these more kind of literal simulacra
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.460]   of the real world in these like virtual worlds,
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.060]   than kind of the things you're talking about
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:38.420]   of like YouTube accounts and charts
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:43.180]   in like basically app stores and stuff,
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.340]   which are user-generated content platforms.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.060]   But I haven't fully analyzed
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.140]   user-generated content platforms,
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.140]   but I do think chart positions are a sort of virtual land,
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.740]   you know, and you do essentially,
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.100]   they do essentially charge rent for that,
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.540]   not just to the platform in their flat 30% fee
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.460]   across everything,
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:04.900]   but also in the kind of advertising Red Queens race
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.220]   you have to do to stay on those charts.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.820]   You essentially have to buy that position and then keep it,
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.700]   you know, and so basically like,
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.660]   there's this huge first mover advantage
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.500]   that turns into rent seeking.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.740]   And I haven't fully analyzed exactly
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.660]   how you apply George's theory there,
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.940]   but I do think there's something to it.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.340]   I also think there's something
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:27.220]   to extremely long-lived copyrights and patents.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.660]   It's a little undercooked at the moment.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.660]   I don't have a fully-fledged theory of it,
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.020]   but certainly cases like other monopoly assets
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:38.220]   like Orbital Real Estate, Radio Spectrum,
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:42.780]   any kind of like being able to capture the right
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.540]   to the possibility space.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:46.060]   Like, especially like,
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.620]   you know how like John Carmack had a lot of algorithms,
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.820]   like some of which were patented
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:52.220]   and he wasn't even allowed to use them in his own games
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.580]   because someone else had speculatively patented like-
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:55.420]   - Oh really?
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:56.260]   That sucks.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.500]   - You know, it was like the,
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.580]   like Carmack's reverse was like this particular algorithm
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.100]   that they weren't allowed to use in like Quake III
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.140]   or something because someone had speculatively patented it.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.980]   And there's like no other way to do that thing.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.740]   So Quake III, this one particular subroutine
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.060]   had to be like 25% slower
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:17.060]   because someone had patented like essentially like,
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.500]   imagine if you could like patent the Pythagorean theorem,
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.820]   you know? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.220]   - So like that kind of nonsense.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.060]   And you can just rent-seek off that for 20 years.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.900]   - Jesus.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.900]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:29.540]   Anyway, I guess we can move on to another juicy implication
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:32.140]   that you were just talking about, which is space.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.100]   There is like this idea, I mean, eventually,
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.180]   hopefully humanity will conquer space
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.780]   and like the rest of the galaxy.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.580]   So, and this is where like Georgism
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:42.260]   will be really interesting and applicable
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:45.620]   because we obviously want to,
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.300]   we want to encourage and incentivize people
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.660]   to like go to new worlds
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.980]   and make use of like stars and planets.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.620]   But we obviously don't want it to be the case
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.420]   that if you got to Mars a year earlier,
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.580]   like if Musk gets to Mars a year before Bezos,
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:04.020]   he has, you know, like forever rights to everything on Mars
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.180]   and all the resources, right?
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.580]   So yeah, Georgism in space would be,
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:11.660]   I think is actually a place that makes a lot of sense.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:12.940]   But I mean, have you put much thought
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.820]   into like, you know, interstellar Georgism?
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.580]   Interstellar Georgism is actually
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.380]   current international law.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.300]   Oh, really?
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.980]   Through the Outer Space Treaty.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.940]   The Outer Space Treaty currently says,
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.260]   and I think the Outer Space Treaty
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.980]   will last for about five minutes
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:31.020]   once the interplanetary space race gets going in earnest.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.740]   But the current law of the international order
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.380]   of the Outer Space Treaty basically says
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.780]   that nobody's allowed to claim interstellar bodies
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:43.020]   like the moon or Mars for China or the US.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.060]   Like we have a flag there,
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.500]   but it's not American territory, right?
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.700]   It's basically international waters, so to speak, right?
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.500]   And once the actual possibility
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.980]   of having permanent bases shows up,
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:57.300]   then we will have to hash that out.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:00.860]   But so basically I think we should take that and run with it
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.340]   and basically be, if you are going to, you know,
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.980]   take possession of interstellar bodies, you know,
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.900]   it will become a question of who exactly
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.820]   becomes the government in that scenario.
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.620]   Is it like some international coalition?
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.460]   Is it the UN?
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.260]   I'm not a huge fan of the UN, you know.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.380]   Or is it just like, it turns out to be like
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.980]   whatever sovereign government gets there first
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.540]   just gets to claim it.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.500]   But can you have Georgism within those confines?
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.620]   I think we certainly should.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:29.700]   You know, because otherwise what you're going to get
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.500]   is that you're going to get under investment.
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.580]   You know, you're going to get so much under investment
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.780]   because the first people to get there
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.260]   are going to basically charge rent
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.860]   to all the people who come next.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:40.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:43.100]   And then I just remembered the other question
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.980]   I wanted to ask about copyright, which is,
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   that's a really interesting and complicated area
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.620]   because it's hard to think of what is the intrinsic
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.980]   sort of value of the land, of the idea,
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.940]   and what is the improvement you've made.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.780]   Right.
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.620]   And so like, what are you going to call
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:00.980]   like the improvement on like the song you discovered?
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:02.180]   Maybe like the melody is like,
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:03.460]   the melody would have existed anyways,
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.940]   but like the specific lyrics you came up with.
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.780]   I don't know.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.620]   It's like copyright.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.260]   It's not clear to me exactly
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.780]   what the implication of Georgism is.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.780]   It's like Georgism, if you zoom out,
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:14.340]   it's not exactly just about land.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.180]   Right.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.020]   That's where people, a lot of people like,
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.900]   kind of like, why are you so obsessed about land?
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:21.340]   It's mostly about enclosure of,
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.340]   enclosure of natural monopolies.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.180]   Right.
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.820]   And, and, and, and, and create,
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:28.740]   and economy is just based entirely around rent seeking.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.780]   And it's clear we have this with like eternal copyright.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.740]   If we had eternal,
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.140]   if we had the copyright laws we had today,
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.740]   when Disney was first getting started,
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.540]   like the Brothers Grimm would still be under copyright
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.540]   and they would not have been able to get off the ground
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.180]   with a lot of their early properties.
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.260]   And then they pulled the ladder up right behind them.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.700]   It's clear they're rent seeking in a lot of ways
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.540]   and refusing to give back to the commons
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.420]   from which they first enriched themselves.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.300]   And the question then becomes like, you know,
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.980]   can you easily parse copyright as land?
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.820]   I mean, it's a very undercooked theory,
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:03.540]   but there's something there of like,
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.660]   probably what it cashes out to is just copyright terms
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.500]   should be shorter, you know, like at some point
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.700]   when an idea has become part of the cultural consciousness
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:16.020]   for like so long, it should become part of just
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:19.500]   the background collective commons, you know,
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.300]   because all ideas are essentially remixed
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.620]   and built on top of other ideas,
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.940]   but we want to incentivize people to create new ideas
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.020]   in the first place.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.940]   It's not a perfect analogy to land,
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.420]   but there is something there about rent seeking
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.780]   that needs to be addressed.
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:33.620]   - Yeah. - And it probably
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.740]   just cashes out to just reducing copyright terms.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.980]   - Yep, yep.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:40.100]   Let's talk about the political feasibility of this idea.
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:45.100]   So, I mean, I just mean land value tax in general.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.380]   Do you think it'll be something that will get passed
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.900]   in a democracy?
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:50.260]   You know, there's like, you know,
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.140]   a lot of people have homes or want to have homes,
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:54.660]   but on the other hand, if you like just redistribute,
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.020]   if you don't have like, I don't know,
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.380]   many acres in the middle of San Francisco,
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.300]   you would maybe still come out net ahead,
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.420]   but would you, could you be able to explain that to people?
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.460]   And obviously there's like tenants
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:03.780]   who would definitely benefit from this.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:07.220]   Anyways, in general, what is your thought
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.980]   on like how politically feasible this is now
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:09.900]   or would be in the future?
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:12.220]   - I think it's more politically feasible than we think.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.060]   I think it just right now has low salience.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.220]   And if more people start talking about it,
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.540]   I think it's going to make a lot of sense,
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.540]   especially if it's pitched as property tax reform.
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.340]   Like right now in Texas, you know,
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.060]   you have people like Huffines
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.380]   who are trying to abolish property tax,
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.580]   which will turn the state into California like that.
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.660]   - Why? - Huh?
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.060]   - Why, how come?
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.900]   - How, why does he want to abolish property tax?
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.380]   - No, why would it turn it into California?
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.420]   - Because California has some
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.820]   of the lowest property taxes in the nation.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.660]   - Yeah.
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:39.580]   - And Proposition 13, and it creates a entire layer
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.300]   of landed gentry and really, really,
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.580]   really expensive housing.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.540]   Like housing's already getting expensive in Austin
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:48.060]   and property taxes have an effect of lowering property prices.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.700]   Property taxes are an imperfect land value tax.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.900]   And so basically it'll just reproduce
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.420]   the economic conditions that empirically exist
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.260]   in California.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.060]   - Yep, yeah, you know, there's like,
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.380]   there's this like funny saying
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.180]   that the Texas Constitution is not a government document,
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.740]   but rather an anti-government document.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.900]   But one of the, I guess, the positive by-products
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:11.060]   if you're a Georgist is since it makes taxing income
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.980]   so hard, governments are forced to tax property
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:15.500]   and hopefully eventually land.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.340]   And therefore--
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:17.980]   - I'm the bone to pick with the Texas Constitution
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.580]   'cause Houston had a single tax mayor in 1911
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.980]   and had an active Georgist land value tax.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:26.260]   And it would have still had it today
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.860]   if it wasn't for the state,
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.700]   for a state judge who basically shut them down.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:31.540]   - Why?
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:32.380]   What was the reason?
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.340]   - Because there's a clause in the state constitution
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.260]   of Texas that says all property taxation has to be uniform.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.220]   And that's interpreted as uniform
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.020]   across both the buildings and the land.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.660]   You can't tax them at separate rates.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.740]   - Yeah, wait, so does that mean that constitutionally
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.900]   you could just couldn't do it in a Texas Senate?
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.220]   - It's up to interpretation.
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.100]   There's some people who interpreted that it's like,
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.820]   that that clause was written to mean
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:56.820]   you can't tax this guy at a higher rate than that guy.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.980]   You have to tax them based on the value of their property.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:02.060]   And then you could claim that it's still being uniform
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.220]   or just taxing land.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:04.360]   And we have all these exemptions
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.040]   and categorizations already.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.500]   This is just another one of those.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.120]   We tax agricultural land at a different rate.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:11.960]   You know what I mean?
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.420]   Like if you put a bunch of cows on a property,
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:16.400]   suddenly it's like it's magically less valuable.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.880]   So why can't we target just the land?
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.080]   And so if you have the right judge,
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.900]   maybe you could get away with that.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.140]   But anyway, to go towards political feasibility,
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.140]   I think it could be more feasible than we think,
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:29.740]   especially pitched as property tax reform,
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.740]   because people are like, property taxes are too high.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.500]   Hey everyone, let's exempt all your buildings.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.140]   I think you could build a coalition
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.460]   that's excited about that.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.940]   And especially if you do the math and show who,
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.540]   like what the change in your taxable rate is gonna be.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:45.020]   I think, you know, just a revenue neutral property tax shift
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:46.520]   to land can be quite popular.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.660]   There's a lot of cities around the US right now
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:50.180]   where this is being floated.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.880]   You know, organizations like Strong Towns
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.040]   and the Center for Property Tax Reform
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:54.880]   are working on a lot.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.720]   And Lincoln Land Institute are like,
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.560]   talking to places about it.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.520]   Detroit is talking about it right now.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.160]   And they could desperately use it.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.660]   And I think it could pass, you know?
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.440]   And then in terms of, I think Henry George's salience
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.800]   is coming back, like, and especially in Norway,
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   like the ruling center party coalition just passed a,
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.560]   you know, their very successful
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.760]   resource management policy with oil.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.000]   They also have one from the early 1900s in hydropower,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.200]   which was set up by Norwegian Georgists.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.360]   And so the ruling center party coalition just put one in
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.080]   for salmon farming aquaculture locations,
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.660]   a new severance tax on that.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.000]   And they name checked Henry George
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.240]   when they implemented it in the speech.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.440]   And so I think if they are willing to, you know,
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.840]   stand up to the landowners in Oslo
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.600]   and pass a land value tax, that would be the next step.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.620]   I'm not sure if they're brave enough to do that.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.360]   But we're starting to see this kind of bubble up.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.040]   And so I think a revenue neutral property tax shift to land
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:51.080]   is the politically popular way to do it.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.400]   Because it can be done on the local level
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.880]   without having to change a whole bunch of laws.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.960]   You know, it's a little complicated in Texas
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:01.120]   'cause that's stupid state constitutional provision.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.400]   But in other states, they don't have those,
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.480]   there's other states that any municipality
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.040]   could do it right now if they wanted.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.880]   - I guess another part of this question then,
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.080]   or the answer is, well,
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.280]   one of the things you talked about in the book is,
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.680]   you know, in some sense,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.360]   the value of your land is caused
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.600]   by the other people around you,
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.640]   or by the properties of like other amenities
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.520]   and companies or whatever that are in,
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.160]   so it's kind of like publicly contributed.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.360]   But if you think about it that way,
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.600]   doesn't it make sense that your land taxes
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.480]   should go to that community,
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:35.040]   which is the one that's creating all this value,
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.200]   rather than being, say, distributed federally?
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.960]   So maybe we should have land value taxes on local levels,
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.200]   but then it goes to pay towards local amenities.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.340]   So it's like, if you live right next to the subway,
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:45.800]   and the reason your property is so valuable
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.520]   is because you're right next to the subway,
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.000]   then that goes towards making the New York subway better,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.320]   but it doesn't go towards like, you know,
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.240]   I don't know, like some sort of the city hall
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.480]   in Kentucky or something.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.600]   - Right, I mean, it's like,
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.920]   if you wanted to create a model for a, you know,
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.600]   bottom-up, decentralized America,
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.720]   like, I would take that bargain.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:05.280]   We still gotta fund the federal government somehow,
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.400]   you know, and so like, I would like to repeal,
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.520]   you know, the federal income tax
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.880]   and have that funded by land value tax,
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.520]   but it's like, I mean, if that's, like,
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:13.560]   as far as I could ever get,
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.840]   I'd shake your hand and take that deal right now.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.680]   You know, sounds good.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.800]   - Yeah, fair enough.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   One more question.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.480]   This one's actually from Twitter from Craig Fratrick,
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.080]   which is, hey, the question is basically,
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.780]   if, I mean, one of the reasons why we think of land
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:30.860]   as being sort of like a public thing
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:33.200]   is because your land value is contributed
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.320]   by people around you,
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.160]   but what if you own so much land
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.160]   that really you are the one that's contributing
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.680]   to the value of all your land, right?
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.960]   If you're thinking of like, something like Disney World,
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.120]   like they basically own like half of Orlando or something,
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.000]   and they're the ones that are creating nearby amenities,
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.040]   which are making the rest of Disney World valuable.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.680]   So in that case, aren't they entitled to all the proceeds?
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.580]   - And what's funny is like, in a way, yes.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.720]   And so what's interesting is like,
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:00.080]   this is often like posed as a gotcha question for Georgists,
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.440]   but we actually like internally,
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.920]   like this is called the Disneyland
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.280]   or the Disney World question, you know?
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.020]   And it's actually a really interesting case.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.180]   And the thing you have to realize now
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:11.560]   is who is Disney World in this situation?
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.720]   Disney World is the government in that case in point.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.460]   Disney World is the community.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.340]   Disney World is the city.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.300]   It's a private city.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.000]   And then there's all these questions of
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.480]   who is a citizen of Disney World
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.760]   and is it an equitable democracy or whatever,
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.720]   which we'll leave aside for the moment.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.800]   But the point is, is that Disney World
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   has fully internalized the positive externalities
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.640]   of their own building, right?
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.480]   And so the incentive structure has changed.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.320]   We fully acknowledge that.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.480]   We just bite that bullet.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.880]   So the question then becomes, you know,
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.640]   what do you do about it?
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.920]   It's a really interesting situation.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.080]   It's essentially a private city, you know?
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.440]   And so there can be certainly issues with company towns,
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.840]   especially when they, you know,
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.160]   enforce local monopolies,
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.200]   essentially like bad local laws
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.160]   where it's like you have to buy
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.080]   from the company store or whatever, you know,
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.760]   which is mostly an issue of governance.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.200]   But in terms of like land use,
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.360]   actually, if an entire landowner
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.040]   owns an entirely large enough area
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:10.720]   to internalize all of their positive building things,
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.560]   that actually, you know, they are actually, you know,
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.840]   that does change the situation.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.600]   And then you need to see them less
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.680]   as the private owner of a parcel
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:23.400]   and more as a private operator of a city, right?
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.240]   And that changes the governance question
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.000]   and it becomes a completely different category of problem.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.400]   And so then there's questions of it's like, you know,
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.160]   what is the right mix of taxes and subsidies?
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.120]   And do you even want to have these sort of entities
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:35.960]   in the first place?
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.840]   And what is the governance question looks like?
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.560]   But the important thing to realize is that
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.600]   you are no longer dealing with a private landowner,
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.560]   you are dealing with a private city.
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.400]   - Wait, okay.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.840]   So is maybe one way to think about Georgism
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:50.280]   that somebody has to be collecting the rents.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.440]   And what Georgians are saying is
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.480]   we want the rents collected by the government
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:58.160]   and not by the person who is like a private landowner,
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.200]   presumably because the government
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.600]   will do more public facing things with it.
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.960]   But like rents have to be collected.
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.200]   We just have, we're just trying to decide
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.400]   who will collect the rents.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.400]   - Rents will be collected one way or another.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.640]   And if we leave it to the status quo,
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:12.400]   private actors free riding off their neighbors
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.520]   will collect them and make everything worse.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.960]   They will cause less investment
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.760]   and they will hold the best land out of use.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.720]   And there'll be less building than there should be.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.840]   And the rent will be too damn high.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.920]   And the rent has to be collected one way or another.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.120]   So it might as well be collected
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.960]   on behalf of the community.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.040]   Because not only will this fix the incentives,
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.360]   but then it also shares the wealth
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.360]   with the people actually produce the wealth.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.840]   And if the community is itself this giant private city,
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.440]   then that kind of changes the equation a bit.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.600]   And I have not like fully delved into
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.600]   the Disney World issue and the Disney World question.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.880]   And that's a little separate academically
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.600]   from actually existing Disney World
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.480]   and how anyone feels about that institution in particular.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.080]   But the important thing to realize
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.480]   is that we're now dealing with a different domain.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.640]   Because then the question is, it's like,
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.040]   who is a citizen of Disneyland?
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.320]   Who is a tenant of Disneyland?
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.200]   What is the governance of Disneyland?
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.760]   It's like you realize that now Disneyland
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.720]   essentially is the government.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.040]   And I think that's actually like kind of literally true
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.760]   in actually existing Disney World
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.120]   because they have their own like special district
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.160]   that operates essentially as a private government.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.320]   And that's just, it's just its own kind of question.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.920]   But the point is very much yes,
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:19.000]   the rents have to be collected one way or the other.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.440]   So they might as well be collected
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.760]   on behalf of the community.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.960]   One way to implement that is through a government, right?
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.320]   Because we have this nice little democracy we can use.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.160]   But you can all, there's also this movement,
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.160]   there's this whole charter cities movement.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:33.440]   And then a movement I like even better
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:34.960]   called starter cities,
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.640]   which is less like let's find some, you know,
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.000]   third world country to like hope our sovereignty
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.320]   doesn't get revoked in five years.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:44.600]   Like, but let's like build cities somewhere in America
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.400]   where zoning is pretty loose.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.280]   You know, you could have everyone who lives there
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.920]   basically be a shareholder of a private entity
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:54.320]   and share out the land rents that way.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.480]   Another way to implement it would just be ground leases
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.520]   rather than land value tax within a private city.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.440]   And then everyone who lives there
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.360]   is de facto a shareholder of the city.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.200]   And there's some people who are trying
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.040]   to build stuff like that,
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.280]   which I'm very much interested in.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.240]   - Awesome, awesome.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.560]   Okay, final question.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.120]   What is next for you?
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:09.960]   - So what is next for me?
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.000]   So I'm still a game developer and you know,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.960]   so nights and weekends I'm overseeing a project
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   that'll release next year,
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.760]   Defenders Quest 2 after a good decade of development.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.760]   I'm happy for that to be finished.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.560]   But then additionally, you know,
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.480]   I am working on a startup,
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.560]   which is called Geoland Solutions for now.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.880]   The name will almost certainly have changed
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.840]   by the time this podcast airs.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.320]   But if you go to geolandsolutions.com,
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.600]   it'll redirect to whatever our new website is.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.600]   And that is a municipal mass appraisal company.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.800]   We're gonna partner with local municipalities.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.200]   We've already got a couple of customers
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.720]   who are interested in what we're doing.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   And we're gonna massively update the state of the practice
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.360]   of municipal mass appraisal in America
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.640]   to be more accurate, more efficient,
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:57.400]   and more up to date with the latest models
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.520]   and more transparent, you know,
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.800]   leaning into open source and open data solutions
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.120]   wherever possible.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:07.760]   And I think that can be the practical step towards Georgism,
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.400]   not just to implement Georgism,
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.800]   but even to advocate for it.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.040]   Because, you know, in the Edward Glazer interview,
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.360]   you know, one of the critique,
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.360]   I'm super happy to have Glazer's endorsement,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.400]   even if he thinks Georgism isn't a panacea.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.240]   One of the things about his critique
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.760]   of it not being a panacea,
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.240]   and I think, you know, it's a polycea,
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.000]   even if it's not a panacea, you know,
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.600]   I'll settle for curing multiple diseases,
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.880]   even if I'm not curing literally all of them,
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.680]   is that I think he's under the impression
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.360]   that land isn't a big deal.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.120]   And how important you think Georgism is
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.000]   depends on how much the land is worth.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.600]   And to do that, we have to measure it.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.640]   And we're not super good at measuring it right now.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.520]   And I think we need to get super good at measuring it.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.240]   And I've decided, you know,
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.560]   when I was talking about this originally,
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.720]   you know, basically someone, you know, challenged me.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.920]   It's like, if you really think you can do this,
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.280]   then the reason I don't think you can do this
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.120]   is because if you really could,
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.600]   then people would give you millions of dollars to go do it.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.240]   And well, we just closed a round,
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.000]   led by Sam Altman, you know,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.400]   and that's exactly what happened,
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.240]   and now we're gonna do it.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.400]   So I'm really grateful to that commenter
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.040]   for challenging me in that way,
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.120]   because I'm like, okay, well,
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.400]   I really see my life's work
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.200]   as like making Georgism possible and practical.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.160]   And I think the way to do that
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.520]   is to measure the value of the land
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.800]   and to put those tools out there
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.440]   for anybody to be able to pick up.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.720]   - Yep, yep, awesome.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.760]   Okay, so the book is "Land is a Big Deal,"
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.920]   and where else can people find you?
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.200]   - Yeah, so you can find me at a couple of places.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.120]   One, the website, landisabigdeal.com.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.360]   You can find me on Twitter @LarsPrime,
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.840]   L-A-R-S-I-U-S-P-R-I-M-E.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.920]   And the book is based on a series of articles
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.160]   that you can find at gameofrent.com.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.240]   And what else?
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.080]   We have another website.
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.000]   Yeah, well, geolandsolutions.com,
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.440]   which will redirect you to whatever the new name is.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.240]   And that's everything I do.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.480]   - Yeah, and this is one of those books,
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.160]   I mean, it's like, there's books you read
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.520]   where you're like, oh, that's interesting, you know?
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.440]   Like, I guess I shifted my priorities slightly.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.560]   And there's books like,
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.040]   oh, fuck, why did I not think about it that way?
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.760]   That's like, wow, that's like changes everything
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.080]   about like how I think about, in this case, you know,
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.280]   economics and it really is one of those things
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.840]   where I think you had the metaphor in the book
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.000]   about like observing the cat in a picture.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   - Yeah, seeing the cat, yeah.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:19.840]   - Exactly.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.040]   So yeah, anyways, I do highly recommend the book.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.080]   It's one of those books you'll read
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.760]   where you'll just have a completely new perspective
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.040]   on an entire field.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:26.880]   - Awesome.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.000]   - Okay, thanks Lars.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:28.840]   Thanks for coming on today.

[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.080]   Thanks for all the hard questions.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.840]   You know, it's like, I really like to be challenged
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.120]   in that way and like really engage with the best faith,
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.200]   you know, hard-hitting critiques, you know,
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.960]   to like make sure we like really understand
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.800]   what we're talking about here.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.160]   'Cause none of this matters unless it works, right?
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.600]   And so it's like, I'm not here
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.080]   to like defend Henry George's honor.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.480]   I'm here to like really explore
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:55.240]   whether this can actually be a solution to our problems.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.560]   - Yep, yep, yep.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.400]   Awesome.

[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.280]   This is still a pretty small podcast.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:13.680]   So it is a huge help when any one of you shares an episode
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:16.000]   that you like, post it on Twitter,
