[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   Did you just finish a good cry
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.880]   because you have this wetness
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.080]   right here on your eye?
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.280]   Oh, sorry, I just got out of my
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.720]   cold plunge in my sauna because
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.000]   you know, I hit a new record low
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   weight 169 this week.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.200]   What's your temperature on?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.000]   I don't want to say it's
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   embarrassing. It's embarrassing.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.720]   I don't want to say no, what is it?
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.320]   I've been doing like 5658.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.320]   That's great. It's okay. I mean,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.520]   all these lunatics like I don't
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.360]   know, they're at 45 degrees 48
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.800]   degrees. I think it's unnecessary.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.080]   You get the same value. I think
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.920]   if my two year old does 56
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.880]   it's good. It's really impressive.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   I consider an 80 degree pool to be
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.480]   a cold plunge.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.000]   I don't get it unless it's like 85.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.040]   That's actually I've been to pool
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.240]   parties at Saxton's house.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.400]   There's no difference between
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   that. It's a schvitz.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.160]   It's a schvitz.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.680]   It's a full on schvitz.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.320]   It's a schvitz.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.200]   If it's not the temperature of
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.240]   bath water, I don't get it.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm going all in.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.960]   Yeah, it's a schvitz.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.520]   It's crazy.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.600]   And then I went in my infrared
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.360]   sauna. So now I've been going in
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.040]   you do the cold than the warm.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.840]   I think you're supposed to do
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.720]   warm than cold. No,
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.960]   they say end on cold.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.080]   And so I've been ending on
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.680]   cold. Yeah, I just do like a
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.360]   cycle. You do cold, warm, cold.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.680]   Cold, warm, cold. Yes.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.960]   And what are you doing? Like two
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.240]   minutes, 10 minutes, two minutes
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.880]   or what do you do?
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.480]   Yeah, exactly. Like one or two
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480]   minutes cold plunge, four minutes
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.240]   you warm up, you get back to it
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.440]   and then you jump back in. Yeah,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.560]   it works pretty good. You know,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.320]   I have to say my energy level
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.680]   goes way up.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.960]   Have you been tracking your
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.840]   blood pressure?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.400]   I have not, but I have this
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.320]   executive health coach that I'm
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.880]   using. And so that's where I got
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.400]   those ridiculous glasses, the
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.840]   blue lights in my sleep better.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.000]   I got some, I've taken some
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.320]   supplements. I'm eating
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.880]   estrogen.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.760]   Are you taking more estrogen?
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.960]   No, estrogen levels are at an
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.080]   all time high for hanging out
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.240]   with you guys. It just oozes
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.080]   onto me. No, it turns out, you
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   know, even at 52, my testosterone
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.280]   is very high. So that's what is
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.880]   your free testosterone? I don't
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.680]   have the number here, but they
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.760]   said it's the high end of normal.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.560]   So I was like, Should I be
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.240]   shooting up testosterone? They're
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.080]   like, No, you're good. You're
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.600]   good. Just we'll send it over to
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   freeberg. I said, All right,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.600]   great. And you're over to
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.680]   freeberg. A lot of people take
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.440]   testosterone in their 50s and
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   60s. And I've had a couple of my
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   friends in their early 60s start
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   H is it HGH? Human growth? Yeah,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   this is I right? Not a good idea.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   Seems like a really bad idea that
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.640]   off menu stuff. I don't think it's
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.800]   a good idea. I think you got to be
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.560]   careful with the off menu items.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.760]   I think you can get a prescription
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520]   for it. Is that right? Yeah, I
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.200]   know. There's a lot of menu items
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.320]   available to affluent people with
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.680]   the right doctors. And I don't
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.880]   think it's a good idea. I mean,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   you guys see Bezos. He's jacked.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.160]   I didn't bring up anybody
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.120]   specifically. He looks great. I
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.160]   think that's just all weights.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.560]   Is he going to be president?
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.720]   I mean, if you had your choice
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.880]   right now between Bezos and Bob
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.080]   Iger, who would you try to find
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.320]   Biden? I think we know who you'd
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.800]   pick. I mean, listen, I was
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.080]   talking to some affluent people
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.920]   and they everybody's going
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.240]   to some affluent people. I don't
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.200]   want to say who but Vivek is now
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.560]   people are starting to talk the
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.680]   thing. I think he's hitting the
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   right chords man. Vivek is about
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.760]   to pass the sentence he will be
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   I think if you look at the
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   polling right now, New Hampshire,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.280]   he'll be the clear number two in
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.440]   about four between four and eight
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.680]   weeks from now. That's crazy.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.200]   That's crazy. And so I think if
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.960]   he becomes a clear number two,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.440]   the the think of this, it's like
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   then all of a sudden, all these
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.560]   MAGA supporters are given Trump
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.720]   and then Trump with some small
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.920]   feature improvements that are
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.320]   actually pretty meaningful, right?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   And then they're like, well, do I
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.920]   want the 80 year old Trump or do
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.480]   I want the 38 year old with like
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240]   the super features, you know,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.000]   I can forgive all of his other
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.600]   issues when he tells me that he's
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.640]   going to cut the government, the
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.840]   federal government by 75%.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.680]   My gosh sold. So you're on so
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   you're on team Vivek. I want to
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.320]   continue to gather a little data.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.440]   There's no rush to make a
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.880]   declaration right now. Give me a
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.160]   little bit of time to mop. Are
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.320]   you with Vivek? Yes, I am. And
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.720]   the reason is I would love for it
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.680]   to be RFK and Biden in a debate
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.440]   and then Trump and Vivek in a
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   debate so that I could really
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.600]   figure out between RFK and Vivek
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.960]   who I would like to vote for.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   But I think it's been pretty
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   clear that the democrats have
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.200]   chosen to railroad RFK candidacy.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   It's unfortunate because I don't
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.640]   think we're given a real fair
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.920]   shake and really being able to
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.560]   evaluate him. Yeah, even the
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.840]   detractors like free bird, you
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360]   have some pretty significant
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.320]   things that you dislike about
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.680]   RFK, which I think are fair.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.600]   They're never going to get a
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.280]   chance to get aired out because
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.240]   you're never going to get a
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.680]   chance to be put on a national
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.440]   platform where there will be
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.360]   really enough debate. And I
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   think that's where America loses.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.440]   So yeah, in that context, I
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.880]   would say that Vivek has done
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.240]   more in the last month to
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.000]   convince me that he is fiscally
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.640]   responsible. And that he has
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.120]   some intuitions that I think RFK
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.080]   and Trump and a lot of people in
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.760]   America share, which is just
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   about the usefulness of the blob.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   And you know that there maybe
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.520]   needs to be a grand experiment
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.120]   where we deconstruct the blob.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.680]   And I'm for that experiment, to
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   be totally honest with you to
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.920]   see what happens.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.040]   So where you at? He's unhappy.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.000]   What I would say, I think it's
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.200]   too early in the process to say
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.720]   definitively, okay, this person
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.040]   has to be the person for me, I'm
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.080]   viewing candidates as either
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.680]   being acceptable or unacceptable.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.560]   And the vague is acceptable to
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.160]   me. I think to Santa says to
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.560]   the ones who are unacceptable to
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   me are the ones who would
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.880]   escalate this Ukraine war,
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.320]   because I think that avoiding
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.240]   World War Three is, to me, the
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.520]   central issue of the campaign.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.000]   So for me, it's just a litmus
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.520]   test issue, I can only support
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.200]   a candidate who would work to
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.560]   end this war, not one who had
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.520]   escalated.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.120]   Where does our fiscal emergency
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.160]   set for you in terms of
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.240]   priorities? So no World War Three
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.600]   priority one is the fiscal
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.880]   emergency that we're facing.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   Priority two, or is it overstated
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.560]   by me, do you think or others?
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.840]   No, I think it's important.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.760]   But the problem is, this is that
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.360]   in order to do something about
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.160]   that problem, you really need
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.760]   bipartisan support.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.720]   Yeah, because it would be
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.400]   suicide for one party to try and
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.680]   do all the heavy lifting without
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.400]   the support of the other.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.440]   And I just don't see in the near
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.880]   to midterm that you're going to
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.160]   get that kind of bipartisan
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.120]   support no matter who is
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.480]   president, whether it's a
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.760]   Democrat or Republican.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   The only issue that for sure,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.320]   the American president has
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   unilateral discretion over is
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.200]   our foreign policy.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.480]   And so for me, making sure that
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.680]   the next president pursues a
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.920]   foreign policy that doesn't
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.200]   result in the destruction of
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.480]   the United States, that to me is
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.000]   the overwhelming issue.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.440]   It doesn't mean these other
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.560]   issues aren't important, but
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.080]   look at how sad numbers are.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.040]   Let me show you this poll for a
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.400]   second, just so we level set with
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.880]   the audience.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.600]   Poll ending September 18 2023.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.560]   For those who are not watching
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.200]   on YouTube, Trump 39% is that or
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.280]   38 then the vague 13% Haley 12%
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.760]   Christie 11% DeSantis 10%
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.360]   That is a stunning turn.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.240]   Yeah, that's probably because
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.600]   it's New Hampshire, J. Cal, but
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.800]   you know, no, I know it's just
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.320]   but that's a very critical state,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.880]   right? I mean,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.240]   sex, what do you think about what
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.200]   Dahlia said on stage about the
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.520]   need to have a Manhattan project
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.200]   style effort here that is
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.520]   bipartisan comes to the center and
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.920]   tries to resolve this as that scale
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.880]   of an emergency.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   Is that realistic to kind of frame
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.520]   this as we are in a fiscal
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.200]   emergency, we have to get a Manhattan
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.640]   project style effort underway to try
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.680]   and engineer a solution.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.560]   Well, let's back up.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.600]   First of all, I think you asked
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.000]   the right question to him, which is
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.600]   is our decline a matter of physics,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   you know, due to forces we can't
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.720]   control, or is it something we still
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.000]   have control over.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.920]   And I think that that's a really
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.440]   good framing.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.800]   I think if you're in the bucket that
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.000]   we can do something about it, I mean,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.960]   I believe that we can.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.400]   The question is how and I think his
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.760]   view was that somehow you get all
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.960]   these elites together and you get
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.920]   them on the same page.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.760]   I don't think that's how
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.600]   our system works.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.360]   I think what happens is you have
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.720]   elections, people compete against
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.240]   each other, and then voters decide
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.800]   who's right.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.040]   And so one side has to defeat the
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.540]   other.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.560]   And I think until we get some clarity
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.920]   from voters on the direction they
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.200]   want to go, I don't think there's
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.560]   going to be a resolution.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.760]   But to your point, there's no
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.680]   solution without bipartisan
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.800]   bipartisanship here.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.960]   So what is the path to bipartisanship
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.560]   when it comes to the fiscal crisis?
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.800]   Wouldn't the obvious thing be if one
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.200]   party wins with that as part of their
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.960]   platform, then it becomes part of the
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.160]   winning platform and the winning
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.560]   formula.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   Are we just saying that's not even
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.600]   possible because it's too unpopular
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.800]   to tell people that they don't get
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.360]   free money?
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.120]   I think it's political suicide for
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.560]   one party to engage in deep cuts,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   deep government cuts, deep cuts of
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   programs, especially popular programs.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.920]   You probably cut the unpopular ones
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.320]   at the margins, but it's political
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.000]   suicide to cut anything important
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.200]   without having the other party on
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.520]   board.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.560]   There's been a couple of times where
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.080]   we've been able to have this type of
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.640]   consensus.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.480]   I mean, the one that always gets
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.200]   mentioned is when Reagan and Tip O'Neill
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.280]   cut a deal and they were able to
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   reform entitlements and make some
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.640]   changes to those programs, and they
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.920]   kind of did it arm and arm, and that
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   worked.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.080]   And then the other time where it kind
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   of happened, not through agreement,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.000]   but almost through lack of agreement,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.480]   was when we had the sequester.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.080]   Remember when Obama was president?
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.000]   And what happened is the Democrats
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.560]   and the Republicans worked out a deal
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.640]   where if they couldn't agree, you
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.440]   would get equal cuts in both military
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.160]   spending and social spending.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.600]   The idea being that Republicans wanted
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.960]   the military spending, the Democrats
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.880]   wanted the social spending.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.320]   And that's ultimately what happened,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.080]   is that they couldn't agree, and so
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.520]   you got the sequester, and we had some
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.440]   spending restraint for a short period
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.320]   of time.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.040]   The problem now is that both Republicans
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.840]   and Democrats want more military
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   spending.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.760]   I don't hear anybody really argue for
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.520]   cutting military spending, except for
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.600]   maybe Ro Khanna at our event.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.000]   But the Democrats are completely on
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.200]   board with war now.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.640]   And then on the social spending, I don't
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.920]   think either party really wants to cut
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.360]   social spending either or do
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.720]   entitlement reform.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.520]   So there is no constituency out there
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.080]   for reining in the biggest sectors of
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.280]   government spending.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.960]   So I don't see how it's going to happen
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   no matter who the president is.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.400]   Well, the forcing function will be the
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.000]   debt service costs, which is just
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.520]   across a trillion dollars a year just to
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.440]   pay the interest, and it's mounting,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.040]   right? 30% of our debt, I think, is
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.680]   coming up for refinancing in the next 12
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.880]   months, and that's going to refinance at
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.560]   a 5% rate, because that's where the
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.200]   markets are at.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.800]   Just like consumers can ignore it,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.480]   Friedberg, and put their fingers in
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.080]   their ears and say, "La la la la la, I
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.000]   don't have to worry about my payments."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.520]   Then the payments show up, and you got
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   to worry about them. Same thing's going
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.000]   to happen here in the US, right?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.440]   The federal budget will get naturally
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.280]   constrained at some point here, but
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:13.840]   yeah.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.920]   As the economist Herb Stein once said,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.320]   "If something can't go on forever,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.400]   it won't." So I think you're
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.360]   right, Friedberg, that this will not go on forever.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.880]   Is that Yogi Berra?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.640]   It's not Yogi Berra, it's Herb Stein, I
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.840]   think. Yeah, if something can't go on
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.760]   forever, it won't. I think that
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.520]   that's where we're headed, is we're going
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.840]   to have restraint imposed on us from the
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   outside. It's not going to come from
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.480]   inside Washington. People stop buying the bonds,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.920]   people stop buying treasuries.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.520]   Interest rates just have to go up to a
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   point that... So what's happening in Japan,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.280]   right? I mean, their bond auctions have
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.040]   been very lukewarm, and supposedly
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.520]   a lot of the money in Japan is coming
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.320]   west, looking for opportunities to get
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   alpha. So we have an example that we can
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   look to. All right, let's get... we can get
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.520]   started here. We've got so much to talk
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.880]   about. I think we got to give some
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.680]   flowers here. Last year, the Sultan of
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.760]   Science, the Prince of Panic Attacks,
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   the Queen of Quinoa was an absolute
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.240]   terror when I did the All in Summit
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.360]   2022. And then this year, he was an
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.160]   absolute all star and delight. What an
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.000]   amazing job you did on the content.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.400]   People are saying the content at All in
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.320]   Summit 2023 is the best conference ever
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.400]   had. Bill Gurley got a four minute
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.040]   ovation. And that talk is on YouTube.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.960]   Elon Musk, star LinkedIn from 40,000 feet.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.280]   He crushed it. Toby was fantastic.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.040]   Ray Dalio, Larry Summers, Mr. Beast,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.280]   Gwyneth Paltrow, the Botes sisters,
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.600]   which we did a pretty good showing, I
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.400]   have to say. A great job to Sax and
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.720]   Friedberg, who held the line with the
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.320]   Botes sisters in our group chess.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.040]   Brian Armstrong. Who am I missing here?
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.720]   I mean, what an incredible lineup.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.840]   The Fusion Panel, Nicole Polk, Rob
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.000]   Henderson, Jenny Just, Rob Henderson.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.640]   I mean, extraordinary. Let me just go
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.280]   around the horn. Chamath, your what
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   discussion or moment pick your choice
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.160]   there for you was the most intellectually
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.800]   engaging and important at the summit.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.760]   You can mention two or three if you
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.260]   like.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.600]   I thought number one were my outfits.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.320]   Pretty great. I mean, you did do an
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.960]   outfit change twice a day. So congrats
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.840]   on that. I like that.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.600]   That's a really good job with that.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.200]   I do agree. I agree.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.120]   Did you guys get the special shoes from
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.400]   Laura Piana?
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.960]   Oh, God, the King's cashmere loafers.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.320]   Yeah, those are ridiculous. I'm wearing
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.480]   them as we speak. Actually, I wore them
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.400]   there at night. And I can wear them.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.720]   These are the most incredible shoes.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.840]   Clouds. They're the most
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.920]   they made like 10 pairs or something.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.160]   And yeah, and we got four special for us.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   Yeah, then I get back to the Beverly
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.120]   Hills hotel, the suite that Friedberg
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.480]   booked me a beautiful suite. Thank you,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.840]   Friedberg. And there is a Laura P
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.480]   Friedberg shafted me on my room.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.880]   What? What? Yeah, I
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.400]   got to put you by the garage.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.000]   No, I got a room that was
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.640]   well, it's very appropriate that these
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.960]   rooms exist, but it's handicap accessible,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.040]   which totally fine, except the problem is
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.400]   the the closet and everything is set for
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.520]   wheelchair height.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.280]   Why did you change your room, dude?
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.640]   And so all my and that's why I thought,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.080]   oh, he just fucked me on purpose. He just
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.680]   tried to control your little passive
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.240]   aggressive name check. So you guys got
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.840]   some work to do in the group therapy.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.240]   Yeah, I would never do that to you guys.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.680]   Don't worry when I when I organize a
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.040]   summit, I'll make sure these details are
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.040]   perfect. I fly on to my plane. He has
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.360]   gluten free Nutella crepes handmade in
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.480]   the morning and I stick him in a
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.080]   handicapped accessible room where he
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.880]   can't even put his bag.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.600]   And I can't put my clothes except
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.960]   without it touching the ground. So then
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.560]   I had to play them on the bed and then
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.680]   I had to lay them on the floor.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.040]   I'm talking about first world problems.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.280]   Yeah, the audience right now is just
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.760]   triggered by the suffering that you
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.120]   went through at the Beverly Hills hotel.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   My honest reaction was I thought the
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   content was really inspiring. I guess
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   it's kind of like I knew what I was
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.240]   going to get up front with so many of
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.480]   the folks because I knew them. But then
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.920]   where I still came away where they
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.480]   exceeded my expectations. Number one,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.600]   probably was Graham Allison. Oh, I could
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.520]   literally talk to him for eight hours a
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.480]   day, I feel like and I don't know him
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.560]   well. So I felt like I was scratching the
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.800]   surface of the things that he knew. I
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.560]   could do an entire dinner, I think where
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.840]   he could just walk through the Cuban
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.120]   Missile Crisis and I could just sit
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.280]   there listening. So I thought he was
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.360]   unbelievably intellectually stimulating
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.800]   for me. Every time I sit down with Toby,
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.720]   I'm just like in awe of how smart and
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.440]   different Toby Lutke is. And so I always
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.480]   kind of like walk away thinking this is
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.760]   really one of the very special
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.440]   entrepreneurs of our generation just in
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.000]   terms of his mindset. Underrated. I
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.920]   thought Larry had the line of the summit,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.320]   Larry Summers, where he said,
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.840]   self esteem should come from achievement,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.360]   and not the opposite, which is that
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.720]   achievement should come from self
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.160]   esteem. And he was talking about
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.320]   wokeism and sort of like, the entire
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.000]   philosophy around that stuff right now.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.360]   And I thought that that was really
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.280]   insightful. Those are probably the three
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.560]   moments I thought girlies obviously
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.040]   presentation was superb. But again, it's
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.400]   kind of like saying the obvious because
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.280]   it was just so masterclass. But the from
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.800]   what I expected to what I got, those
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.000]   were the three that I thought were the
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.160]   most inspiring and net new positive for
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.200]   me. Fantastic. Saks. Did you have any
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.120]   moments aside from Gwyneth Paltrow
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.440]   saying she was your favorite bestie other
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.520]   than that being the clear number one for
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.160]   you and crushing soul crushing for us?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.680]   Well, we're your favorite. We've heard
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.120]   that because the zoom issues, we had
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.800]   technical issues during her interview,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   and it got really hard to hear her at
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   various points. And I don't think you
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.160]   guys heard that either. Right?
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.640]   I heard I tried to ignore it. I tried to
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.320]   block. I couldn't I couldn't hear it. So
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.000]   I didn't know that. Yeah. Well,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.560]   congratulations. We can we keep that up
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.080]   right here. No, we're not doing victory
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.600]   laughs on the pod. We talked about this
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   on the chat. No, I mean, that's awesome.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.560]   Go go for it. I want to hear it.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.040]   You know, my husband, but we have a
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.440]   little bonus potential is he thinks I'm
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.680]   in love with David Sachs. So he's letting
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   you do it. So it's a fetish.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   Oh, my God. She's in love with David
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.840]   Sachs. That his her husband thinks that
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.200]   she is a little bonus potential is he
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.360]   thinks I'm in love with David Sachs. So
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.680]   he's letting you do it. So it's a fetish.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.560]   This is not good. David is incredible.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.880]   The husband's jealous. And that's not a
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.520]   good situation. Reuse. After that, what
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.680]   did you like sex? Be honest. I want to
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.000]   also give credit to David Sachs, who
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.240]   showed up for every talk. And
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.200]   freeberg said, Jake out an issue. I said,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.800]   Well, anything I can help? He said, Oh,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.040]   well, actually, the issue is I asked
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.800]   David Sachs to show up at 845 for the
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.960]   run through and he he won't respond to
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.240]   me. Can you can you get in touch with
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.440]   him? I said, Let me tell you what's
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   gonna happen with David Sachs. program's
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.200]   gonna start at nine. He'll be here at
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.000]   856. And if you get them on stage for
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.240]   two out of three talks, you did better
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.000]   than I did. And free birds team, which
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.440]   God bless the production work team, they
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.520]   did an amazing job. These Wolverines are
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.120]   incredible. Shout out to Laura, Rachel
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.480]   and everybody on the team there. They did
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.360]   a fantastic job. And sure enough, sack
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.840]   shows up at 856 goes on stage and he
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.480]   crushes it. So great job getting him on
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.160]   stage. But congrats on showing up for
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.080]   they wanted me I mean, I asked when's the
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.560]   first speaker going on stage? Yeah,
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   actually, it was 10am. Right? 10am. Sorry,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.960]   10am. 10. So I'm like, okay, in my head,
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.560]   I'm thinking, okay, I'll be there at 959.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.960]   And I'm like, what time do you? Yeah. And
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   then they're like, you were there at 955.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.520]   And I was like, 830 for a sound check.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.640]   And I'm like,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.600]   I'm a staggered out for the sound. What?
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   I'm sorry, it is Jimmy Page.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.000]   Like,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.720]   I'm talking about here.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   I'm trying to come check. Okay, let's
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.320]   start. Let's start the show. Can we
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.840]   anyway? They're very self aggrandizing.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.760]   Look, I thought the conference was
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.440]   amazing. It exceeded my expectations.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.400]   Your conference exceeded my expectations
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.840]   to J Cal, but I think free bird took it
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.240]   to another level. Yes, he did exceeded my
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.920]   my already high expectations.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.360]   Yeah, you know, highlights. I mean, I
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.200]   think starting with Ray Dalio as the
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.360]   first speaker was really interesting.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.520]   I think we only got to go for what 3040
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.640]   minutes with him. I felt like we could
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.400]   have gone for two hours. You have to
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.800]   bring it back on the pod and, you know,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   drill into that topic more.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.440]   Two hours with Dalio would be amazing.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.880]   Because I think what's really interesting
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.640]   is the way that he's looking at the grand
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.240]   sweep of history, right? He's thinking
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.200]   about not just a 10 year business cycle
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.840]   or a 75 year debt cycle. He's looking at
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.200]   a 250 year empire cycle. I think this is
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.400]   really interesting that he thinks in that
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   really big way. I agree. Graham Allison,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.640]   really interesting. We could have spent
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.120]   two hours with him. Larry Summers. These
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.080]   are all people I think we should bring
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.000]   back on the pod for a long form
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.440]   conversation. I agree that Bill Gurley's
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.480]   talk was one of those great Ted style
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.240]   talks that I think should go viral. I
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.320]   think it has, you know, I think 20 million
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.160]   people should watch that. Yeah. I mean,
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   the people retweeting it are incredible.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.680]   And I was at a dinner party last night.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.360]   And everybody was talking about it. So
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.160]   it's spread into our industry. And it's
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.280]   starting to tip over into other
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.880]   industries already. The chess was really
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.960]   fun. I am a game day player that way.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.320]   You know, I brought it and managed to win
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.720]   the game.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.040]   I don't know. There were a lot of great
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.480]   moments. I'm sure forgetting about things.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.680]   I love that. I love that.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   Parties were incredible.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.600]   The parties were absolutely incredible.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.360]   We missed both of you guys at the Grimes
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.440]   DJ set. That was amazing, by the way.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.960]   I think Chamath was there for that.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.600]   Weren't you there?
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.760]   No, I left right at 10 to fly back to
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.320]   the Bay Area early night. Yeah,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.560]   I got it. Yeah, she Grimes. Thank you to
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.080]   Grimes for doing that for me. A personal
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.880]   favor. The audience lost their minds.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.320]   Santa Monica. She was incredible. She's
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.680]   such a performer. It's incredible.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.920]   Yeah, people were losing their minds.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   For you, Freeberg, best moments on stage.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.280]   It was just great to be with everyone and
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.880]   go through it. I mean, honestly, I didn't
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.560]   source all these speakers you guys did.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.320]   And so I don't want to take credit for
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.880]   that. I think it was what I had hoped.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.720]   You know, I went to Ted for 12 years.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.480]   I started going to Ted, I think, 2007.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.720]   And I felt pretty disappointed over the
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.560]   last couple of years. And I actually
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.800]   spoke to the CEO of Ted and said, I'm not
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.880]   going to go anymore because so much of
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.240]   this, the talks became kind of social
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.120]   justice type talk nonsense that I
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.640]   wouldn't I don't want to use that term
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.080]   because I do think it's all very well
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.160]   intentioned. And I think it just became
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.520]   overwhelming that you would go to Ted
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.160]   and you would basically feel bad about
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.280]   yourself. And that it kind of missed the
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.000]   element of the world is an amazing place,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.040]   we should have a great degree of
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   optimism with technology and where it's
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.280]   taking us. We should observe the greater
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.640]   cycle and the bigger perspective of
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.320]   things that are happening in the world,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.880]   not kind of go into a whodunit and
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.720]   who's to blame and us versus them kind
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.240]   of mentality, which I think so much of
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.640]   this stuff turned into at Ted, and I was
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.840]   really hoping we could capture some of
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.320]   that. And so I'm really glad we got a lot
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.640]   of the speakers we did and had a couple
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.440]   hours to be able to share, you know,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.440]   those sorts of perspectives. So it was
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.760]   fun. I really enjoyed what you did with
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.600]   the conference in terms of the editorial
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.200]   direction was great. You leveled it up,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.720]   certainly from last year, as Tramont
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.520]   pointed out correctly. And it had a great
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.480]   amount of optimism, realism. And we
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.360]   didn't talk about superfluous virtue
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.040]   signaling, social justice, woke nonsense
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.440]   that really is should not be at the top
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.360]   of the agenda. In my mind, I'm not saying
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.200]   that these issues are not important to
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.160]   some people. But I think prioritizing
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.920]   what's important in the world is what I
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.440]   got out of the conference, you know, when
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.560]   you have people on this level, speaking
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.200]   for for, you know, very long periods, not
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.520]   long enough, but, you know, that Larry
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.880]   Summers and you know, Ray Dalio, these
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.120]   talks, they really gave you a sense of
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.960]   this is what's important in the world
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.920]   right now, this is the priority. And I
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.360]   came away from it so intellectually
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.760]   stimulated, maybe just say, hey, you know,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.200]   I want to travel more, I want to read
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.520]   more, I want to have more conversations.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.080]   And I have been basking in that, like
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.520]   afterglow. So I just want to say, you
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   know, once again, what an extraordinary
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.680]   amount of teamwork, just as the moderator
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.080]   of our quartet, felt everybody did a
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.400]   great job moving the ball around. I think
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.160]   everybody was on their game, everybody,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.040]   you know, I'm talking about the three of
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.800]   you guys. Very focused on just knowing
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.480]   exactly when to insert a great question.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.080]   So I felt like we were playing
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   basketball, like the Warriors when they
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.400]   play prime basketball ball move really
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.200]   well. Great questions, people picking up
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.600]   on themes, threading beams from one talk
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.440]   to the other. And it just made me really
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   excited for next year. So I just want to
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.480]   say great job to each of you. Thank you.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.120]   Back at you. Yeah, back at you. Listen, we
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.120]   could talk about ourselves all day, but
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.040]   people hate that. Let's talk about what's
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.560]   going on in the markets. Yeah, we only
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.920]   did it for 40 minutes. Perfect.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.160]   Okay, yeah, exactly. IPOs and M&A on fire.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.360]   We've had a ridiculous week. Six quarters
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.040]   of down market has suddenly turned into a
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.760]   bunch of green shoots on the M&A front.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.280]   Cisco announced it acquired Splunk for
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.080]   $20 billion in an all cash deal. If the
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.760]   notes are correct here, it's about 10% of
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.480]   Cisco's market value. Somebody did a
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.160]   trade where they bought a bunch of
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.720]   options. And so that looked a little
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.880]   fugazi. Congratulations to Nancy Pelosi
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.080]   on that trade possibly.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.680]   Allegedly, don't forget your favorite
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.560]   word, allegedly. Allegedly, allegedly,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.000]   perhaps I don't know she's good at
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.760]   trades. So if somebody is going to make
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.600]   money on that trade, or somebody's going
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.560]   to jail. So congrats to Scrully, Instacart,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.360]   Klaviyo and Arm all IPO in the past week.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.160]   And you know, they've fallen back to
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.400]   earth. Just crazy stat. 21 months since
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.720]   the last significant venture back
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   company went public, I'll leave out like
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.880]   the Middle Eastern food company was a
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.280]   kava that went public. And then the
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.520]   vacuum company that went public. But
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.120]   that's just in the past seven days. So we
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.600]   talked about this on the program. We
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.360]   discussed, hey, we'll know when the
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.360]   markets are back if some of these
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.080]   companies are forced to walk the plank
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.520]   slash get public, you know, and fix their
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.200]   cap tables. And sure enough, it's the
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.880]   car really kind of represents that most
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.960]   most of the late stage investors in
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.680]   Instacart are underwater. The early stage
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.640]   folks absolutely crushed it. Chamath.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.520]   Listen, you're you're a market expert
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.880]   here. You've taken a lot of companies
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.600]   public. What do you think the last week
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.160]   means for the greater technology
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.720]   industry?
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.600]   I don't think that this was the great
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.920]   reopening that we all were hoping for.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.080]   I think it's important to understand the
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.160]   dynamics of bank led traditional IPOs in
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.280]   America. And the best way to understand
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.120]   them is to contrast and compare to how
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.680]   that same company would go public in
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.760]   Europe or Asia, because it'll explain
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.200]   what what happened. And I think
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.720]   unfortunately, what has happened is not
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.040]   good for the market. So typically, what
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.200]   happens is when you construct an IPO,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.440]   you're selling 15 to 20% of the company.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.520]   And when you do that, you go and you
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.240]   call hedge funds and you call these
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.000]   mutual funds, but what are called long
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.680]   only right, meaning they don't short,
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.280]   they just go along these big mutual fund
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.080]   companies. And you try to find a handful
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.640]   of people to anchor the IPO. So they take
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.960]   a huge piece of that 15 to 20%. And in
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.040]   Europe and Asia, the securities law says
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.840]   that when you get such a big allocation,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.600]   you have to hold it for six months,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.240]   which means you're treated exactly the
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.720]   same as the employees who are typically
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.600]   locked up in an IPO for at least six
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.080]   months. And so what happens is these
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.520]   firms do all kinds of diligence. And
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.960]   when they buy something, it's because
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.640]   they really believe in it. And then they
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.200]   go long it for you know, what is at least
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   half a year. So it's a it's a non trivial
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.360]   amount of time. So that's what happens in
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.600]   Europe and Asia 15 to 20% of the company
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.160]   is sold a handful of people anchor and
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.400]   you're locked up for six months. Now you
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.080]   need to look at how American IPOs are
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.840]   done, which is why people have
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.560]   experimented with direct listings. We've
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.640]   experimented with SPACs, it's because the
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.760]   fundamental architecture of IPOs are
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.200]   broken. They're set up in a dynamic where
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.920]   it's a heads I win tails, you lose
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.640]   situation for the bankers that run the
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.120]   IPO. Now what happened in these three
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.240]   IPOs? Number one, it was less than 10% of
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.280]   the float. So highly, highly, highly
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.680]   concentrated small amount of the of the
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.280]   company was made available for sale.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.560]   Number two, there really weren't anchors.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.960]   What happened was the allocation of that
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   less than 10% was smeared across 50 or 60
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.120]   different organizations. And then number
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.960]   three, there was no lockup, which meant
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.920]   that people could sell right away. And so
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.680]   what you saw with all of these companies
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.480]   was the exact same dynamic, which was it
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.960]   opened, because there was such a small
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.440]   amount of supply, it traded up. And
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.520]   the minute that retail, which typically
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.040]   tends to be late to the game, because
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.480]   they don't have access to these things,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.840]   right? When they started buying, what was
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.760]   unique this time around is all of the
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.200]   mutual funds just dumped everything. And
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.040]   the hedge funds were like, well, we don't
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.880]   have a real allocation, our friend said
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.960]   in the group chat, he got a five or $10
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.840]   million allocation in these IPOs. These
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.320]   are 20 and $30 billion hedge funds, five
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.160]   and $10 million allocations don't move
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.480]   the needle. So the hedge fund sold right
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.320]   away and got on the sidelines and said, I
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.960]   don't care about this. The long only
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.120]   bought just enough to make the stock go
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.800]   up because of such a small supply, then
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.560]   when retail stepped in, they just dumped
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.280]   it all. And so unfortunately, what's
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.000]   happened is all three IPOs within a few
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.960]   days have breached their issue price. Now
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.200]   they're at the same issue price may be
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.440]   slightly higher. But that is an
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   unsuccessful dynamic. What could have
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.520]   been different, the banks could have
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.160]   forced these companies to sell up to 20%
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.520]   the banks could have found a few anchor
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.080]   buyers, the banks could have created a
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.840]   lockup structure for these anchor buyers,
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.960]   they did none of it. And so the result is
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.240]   a lot of downward pressure in a moment
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.560]   where the overhang of rates has have come
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.760]   back and are forcing all of us to realize
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.360]   in we'll talk about it in a second that
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.640]   these rates are going to be higher for
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   longer, which completely changes how you
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.200]   value these tech companies. So net net,
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.880]   very poor IPO construction by the banks.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.640]   And this the grand reopening was a grand
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.680]   closing, I think.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.520]   Okay, so just to put some numbers on that
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.320]   instacarts float was 6.7%. And clavio's
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.600]   float 7.6. arms float almost hit the 10%
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.320]   9.4, but certainly less than the 20% that
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.000]   you would expect. So then I guess the
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.120]   follow up question here, saxes, why did
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.360]   these companies go out? And do will we see
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.440]   the the other big ones go out the stripes?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.000]   And some of the other backed up inventory?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.440]   What's what's the back channel in our
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.920]   industry about the viability of other
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.600]   IPOs? Is this going to push a lot more
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.680]   people out to get liquidity, even at
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.080]   discounted prices, even with the headwinds
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.440]   that you're not points out? Or is this
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.120]   going to have a chilling effect? And
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.080]   people are going to say, you know what,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.520]   let me wait till 2025.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.600]   So I think they went out because
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.480]   investors and others need liquidity. And
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.240]   there's no point holding on and waiting
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.440]   for a valuation that's never going to
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.600]   come back. I mean, so you take instacart,
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   for example, their last private round was
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.160]   at 39 billion. What's the market cap now
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.520]   around nine, nine. So it's great that
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.760]   they got out. I think that is eight today.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.920]   At eight. I mean, look, it's sort of a
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.240]   green shoot that they got out. But we're
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.560]   never going back to the valuation levels
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.880]   that we had a couple years ago during a
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.920]   giant Zerp created asset bubble. So I
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.840]   just think there's no reason to wait. And
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.680]   you look at SoftBank, they needed the
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.320]   liquidity from the arm IPO. Yeah. So I
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.360]   think that's why these companies are
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.120]   going out is we're kind of getting back
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.600]   to business as usual. Just to broaden out
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.320]   the question a little bit. What I think
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.560]   is interesting is that for the past year
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.440]   or so, we've been in a software recession.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.960]   It really started in the first half of
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.120]   2022. The markets cratered, especially for
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.520]   growth stocks. There's a huge correction
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.080]   of valuations that happened in especially
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.600]   the first half of 2022. But then about a
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.920]   year ago, so starting in mid 22 and
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.040]   continuing through Q2 of this year, you
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.000]   saw a reduction in growth forecasts,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.240]   everybody started forecasting down.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.840]   There wasn't a single board meeting that
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.560]   I was in, in private companies that
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.600]   wasn't missing their numbers and
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.680]   reforecasting down. And you saw it in the
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.040]   public companies as well. I think
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.520]   German ball sub stack showed that the
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.600]   average growth forecast for SAS companies
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.840]   for next 12 months have been cut roughly
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.440]   in half. So for the last year, year and a
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.040]   half, we've been in a software recession,
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.920]   you could say a B2B recession, we saw
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.120]   companies like Meta, Google, and so on cut
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.400]   thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.040]   jobs, you know, get much more efficient.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.480]   Yeah, each that meant they were buying a
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.160]   lot less software on a per seat basis.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.440]   So I think we've been through call it a
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.640]   B2B or enterprise recession. But the
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.240]   thing that's held up stronger than I
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.680]   think people might have expected over
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.040]   the past year has been the consumer.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   Consumer spending has kept the economy
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.120]   afloat. So the B2C part of the economy
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.640]   has been strong, whereas B2B has been
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.000]   very weak. What I wonder about next is
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   whether that's going to flip. I wonder
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.120]   if the consumer is on their last legs
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.160]   here, you see credit card debt is at an
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.480]   all time high interest payments on
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.880]   credit card debt, all time high
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.040]   mortgages, the rate now is approaching
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.600]   8%. So no one can afford to sell their
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.840]   house, which has a 3% mortgage, and then
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.160]   buy a new one at 8%. So real estate
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   transactions have cratered. The
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.280]   commercial real estate industry is, you
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.720]   know, on his last legs, I think they're
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.080]   starting to throw the keys back to the
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.520]   bank and start forfeiting buildings
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.840]   because they can't refi it an attractive
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.040]   rate. So I just wonder if the consumer
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.960]   now is about to go through the type of
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.600]   pain and restructuring of their personal
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.680]   balance sheets the way that the
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.360]   enterprise segment of the economy over
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.080]   the past year,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.560]   Freiburg, your thoughts on what we're
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.000]   seeing here in terms of the IPO window
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.480]   companies getting out, and the impact
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.360]   that'll have maybe on how limited
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.680]   partners look at venture funds that's
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.840]   been frozen for 18 months, limited
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.760]   partners, and I'm raising a fund right
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.400]   now publicly under 506 C so I can talk
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.120]   about it. And it's going great. But man,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.080]   it's a lot of meetings. And I'd say two
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.760]   thirds of the meetings I'm having,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.200]   people are saying we're not adding
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.960]   managers, we're cutting managers and
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.640]   we're cutting commitments to managers.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.240]   But we'd love to meet, you know, just to
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.960]   start the relationship, you know. So what
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.520]   do you think this means overall for the
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.320]   limited partner GPs and the startup
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   market?
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.800]   Start of a turnaround or maybe just
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.840]   sideways for more?
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.640]   I guess we should just put the volume in
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.320]   context. If you
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.880]   look at the slide, this is from Ernst
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.840]   and Young,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.960]   showing the IPO activity by year. And
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.480]   this was through June 30.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.040]   So if you assume kind of a steady state,
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.280]   you probably are going to come in at a
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.160]   volume that's less than 22. And perhaps
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.080]   even less than going back all the way to
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   2019, with less than 1200 IPOs during the
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.800]   year, compared to the peak of 2400, which
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.280]   happened in 2021. If you go to the next
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.200]   slide, and just look at the total dollar
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.080]   volume raised, so that IPO proceeds,
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.160]   thus far through June 30 of this year is
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.480]   just around 60 billion.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.520]   Compare that to a total of about 180
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.040]   billion,
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.160]   all of last year, 450 billion in 2021.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.960]   And the IPOs we're talking about today
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.000]   Instacart, Clavio,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.560]   Arm, in total raised about five and a
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.320]   half billion dollars.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.200]   So you know, that kind of doesn't have a
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.440]   huge consequence on this dollar volume
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.760]   for the year. And then if you look at
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.520]   what's in the pipeline right now, in
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.800]   terms of what's publicly filed as s ones,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.000]   there's basically nothing right now. So I
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.280]   think everyone's kind of sitting around
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.720]   waiting to see how these
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.480]   transactions go before they decide to
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.760]   put other stuff. I think the big mistake
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.920]   is that we continue to treat IPOs as
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.480]   this big yardstick.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.200]   The real yardstick for a business is the
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.120]   performance of the business.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.360]   And the valuation you get when you raise
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.520]   capital at some point in time is largely
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.360]   driven by market conditions, not
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.040]   necessarily by the performance of the
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.480]   business and the value of the business
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.280]   over time, the market will do its job
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.120]   and rightly value that company. We've
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.280]   talked at length about how much value
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.960]   has accrued as a public company for
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.400]   Apple, for Microsoft, for Google, 99.9%
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.880]   of their total market value was realized
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.000]   post IPO. So that the IPO transaction, I
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.240]   think it's a little too much weight, and
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.320]   gets a little too much attention in
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.720]   terms of determining success or failure
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.960]   of a business and success or failure of
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.120]   the investors in that business. So I
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.800]   really hate this whole thing about does
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.720]   the IPO price go up on a day it's this
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.440]   really weirdly engineered thing that
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.120]   they try and do to drive psychology and
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.920]   marketing by banks to go out and they
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.920]   the banks to try and get people to give
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.440]   them more capital or to give them more
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.640]   deals in the future. Do you think that
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.720]   the IPO market would be better served if
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.120]   banks were forced to be locked? Or the
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.040]   the allocations were forced to be six
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.720]   months locked like the employees? Of
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.480]   course. Maybe longer? What if they were
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.000]   if they were locked for seven? What do
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.720]   you think? Well, where would the float
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.600]   come from on day one? But why do you need
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.000]   a float? Yeah, I mean, that's, that's a
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.520]   good point. I, I believe the direct
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.720]   listing should be the way that you do
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.960]   this. And then you do a follow on
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   offering once you're sure. The problem
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   with the direct listing, as I found as a
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.200]   seller, because I went through a handful
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.720]   of direct listings, I went through Slack,
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.320]   and I went through Coinbase. Coinbase,
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.560]   right? Yeah. And in the Slack direct
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.720]   listing, I only sold a small portion on
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.840]   day one. And it turned out to be a
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.560]   mistake. And the reason was because the
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   pricing of a direct listing forces you
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.360]   to find the absolute highest price at the
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.320]   open. Now, I we learned that so then
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.240]   going into the Coinbase IPO, what all
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.320]   the venture investors did was
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.280]   distributed, literally the day before and
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.360]   the day of the direct listing, right, so
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   that you would get delivered your stock
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.520]   at the highest price so that you could
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.240]   sell. I'm not sure that that serves
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.160]   anybody any better. You know what I mean?
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.440]   Because then you get a lot of price
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.000]   volatility, and the price just goes
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.040]   straight down. So I don't exactly know
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.880]   what the answer is. I suspect though, that
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.400]   getting companies to float at least 15
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.200]   to 20% and doing a better job of
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.680]   allocation so that you're right, David,
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.520]   removing the psychology of like, it has
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.000]   to go up 100% on day one is success is
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.360]   the thing that actually catches these
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.440]   companies off guard. Now, we haven't even
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.960]   talked for a minute about whether any of
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.240]   us thinks the quality of Instacart and
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   Clavio and arm are good businesses. And
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.920]   this is part of it as well. Exactly.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.480]   Just spent 15 or 20 minutes debating the
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.240]   stock price that is completely divorced
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.720]   from the reality of these businesses. And
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.160]   that's a bunch of distraction that the
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.840]   banks create as well that are that is
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.280]   totally unnecessary. I mean, what do you
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.960]   guys think about the click on?
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.040]   Let me just respond to the direct
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.800]   listing point. I just want to also point
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.440]   out Spotify went public via direct
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.120]   listing the stock actually traded up
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.280]   after the direct listing. It went down a
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.560]   little bit after but it continued to
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.200]   trade up, you know, into the 2021 era.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   And today it's trading at or above what
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.400]   it was trading at during the direct
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.480]   listing. So can I tell you why, though,
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.760]   the performance of that business
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.840]   fundamentally drove interest from
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.400]   investors.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   The thing with the Spotify IPO was that
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.640]   it was still a very new vehicle. And so
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.320]   that direct listing was we were all
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.400]   learning as we went along. And at the
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.080]   end of the day, there was one bank that
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.840]   kind of not cornered the market, but
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.760]   really became an expert on it. And they
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.400]   use Spotify as the example. So by the
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.640]   time Slack and then Coinbase came along,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.680]   the playbook was so tight that everybody
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.640]   knew how to play the game. So I think a
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.320]   lot of the Spotify post IPO behavior was
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.920]   a bunch of people figuring out what a
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.680]   direct listing meant. By the time that
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.160]   we actually DL slack, and specifically
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.040]   when we DL Coinbase, the bank was so
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.560]   sophisticated in telling us here's
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.000]   what's going to happen. Here's what you
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.680]   should do. What do you want to do? And
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.600]   obviously, we wanted to do the thing
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.280]   that maximize returns for our LPS. So
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.120]   I'm not sure that the Spotify example
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.960]   will ever repeat in a direct listing. I
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.080]   think that the Slack and Coinbase
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.560]   particularly will be the example going
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   forward, you'll top tick day one, and
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.240]   then the thing will spear down find a
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   bottom and why does it matter? Why is
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.600]   isn't it ultimately about finding the
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.120]   real market value for the company?
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.680]   It doesn't matter that the price goes
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.360]   down or goes up that ultimately the
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.800]   buyers that want to pay a certain price
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.640]   will step in and buy and the folks that
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.680]   want to sell because they think the
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.880]   price is higher than their mark will
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.720]   want to say I agree with you. I do think
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.640]   that it's really about business
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.080]   fundamentals, but there's a lot of
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.600]   people that get caught up in the price
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.920]   as what the quality of the businesses
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.520]   that those people are maybe not the
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.120]   most sophisticated people in the world,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.880]   but they make a lot of noise for not
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.280]   knowing what's going on. And so they can
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.200]   be a real distraction to a CEO trying to
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.000]   run a business.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.200]   I remember in 2008 I think I've told you
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.960]   guys this story. It was like November of
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.000]   2008 Expedia was trading down to seven
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.640]   bucks and I saw Dara at some event in
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.960]   March. Yeah, March and he said, Hey, our
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.480]   stocks at seven bucks. I can't believe
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.000]   it. I mean, like everyone should be
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.240]   buying our stock. And that was well off
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.760]   of the price that it had been trading at
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   in 03, 04, 05. And sure enough, if you
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.280]   had bought that stock, you know, you
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.480]   would have made 15x from there to where
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.080]   we sit today and even more if you sold
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.960]   at the top tech in 2021. So, you know,
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.720]   these yeah, that's a that's a good chart.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.200]   So look at where Expedia was in March of
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.560]   09 was right around seven bucks. And I
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.560]   think that that was for me like the
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.480]   first example where I really understood
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.000]   that the price where the market trades a
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.320]   stock shouldn't matter as much as the
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.760]   fundamental value of the business if
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.280]   you're willing to be a long term holder
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.400]   if you're willing to say you know what
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.840]   you're willing to do the work and you
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.520]   have to do the work. Yeah, most people
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.120]   are not willing to do the work. They want
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.600]   to look at a price and then they want to
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.640]   imbue all of their own psychological
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.040]   desires into it versus what are the
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.960]   actual ones and zeros of a spreadsheet
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.640]   tell you? Yeah, but I'm like a pure
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.160]   efficient market guy. I feel like that,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.440]   you know, whatever shares should be
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.360]   people want to sell, they should be able
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.640]   to sell whatever people want to buy
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.320]   should buy the market. And if the stock
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.160]   gets too cheap, there's plenty of
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.600]   capital out there to step in and buy the
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.200]   stock if they think that it's too cheap
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.880]   and the market will find itself. So
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   let's do the underwriting of Instacart
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.240]   then where any of you guys investors in
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.200]   Instacart? No, for any. I am in a fund
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.960]   that's an Instacart from the seed round.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.920]   So I will do I think very well because of
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.160]   that. Let's bleep that out. Thank you.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.080]   That's that will be a that'll be a
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.720]   yum yum for J Cal. But let's just talk
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.360]   about revenue.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.560]   When it trickles down all the way to you
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.320]   as an LP, what's the real multiple?
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.600]   I guess, you know, if you take out the
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.080]   carry 25 or 30% less than what looks like
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.920]   to be the whole fund first. So yeah,
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.600]   that funds been paid back many times over
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.200]   already. So that you know what the
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.720]   multiple is on that fund for you? Yeah,
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.960]   it'll it was 8 million invested. And
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.440]   that's their investment. That's not your
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.160]   investment. Yeah, what if you look at
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.840]   your investment, what my understanding
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.880]   is that investment is going to be 200 x
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.960]   100 or 200 x somewhere somewhere in that
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.200]   range. I will report back but I think the
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.640]   seed round investors are gonna be hold
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.800]   on. So you're saying 8 million will
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.840]   become 1.6 billion. I think it's over a
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.120]   billion. We can actually have a chart
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.960]   here. Let's take a look at let's assume
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.560]   it's a billion 1.6 seems a little high.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.200]   Let's say a billion. But let's say the
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.800]   fund was what 5600 million. So for the
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.320]   LP, it's like a two x. I'm just saying
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.400]   that yeah, for the fund, it was 100 x,
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.560]   but for the LP, it's a two x. I think
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.840]   that's a big difference, right funds
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.000]   already in the black. So mitigating
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.080]   factors. Okay, so it's two extra turns
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.120]   of your investment. Meaning if it was a
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.640]   four x Jason, he's saying that it'll
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.360]   become a success. Yeah. Yeah, something
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.720]   like that. Yeah, I mean, it's a good
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.640]   fund. I'm not disparaging it. But I just
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.240]   try to set things and put things in
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.400]   proportion. I think I think at this
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.240]   point, that funds at 21 x right now.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.960]   Something in that range. So it's a
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.480]   pretty great fund in terms of total to
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.880]   23 x, something to that effect. Yes.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.280]   It's going to be pretty amazing. What
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.920]   else was in there? I think that was
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   instant gram and WhatsApp were also in
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.440]   the fund either before it or with it. So
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.360]   they were pretty good fun. There were
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.840]   two funds. I would say which firm this
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.240]   is. But 12 and 24 x, I believe is the
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.840]   last time I checked in. What's up was a
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.920]   monster. That was a really well,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.080]   everybody learned from WhatsApp. And,
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.480]   you know, shout out to the Sequoia team,
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.320]   W only I think and they did every round
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.040]   Jim gets to them. Yeah, they did every
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.360]   round. So it was an internal round for I
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.520]   think four rounds in a row. So they just
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.600]   made preemptive offers. The reason
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.520]   WhatsApp was a home run is because it's
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.240]   also capital efficient. Yes, burn that
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.480]   much. They didn't raise that much. So
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   there's very little dilution. Yeah, for
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.360]   everybody. I mean, and I think that's
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.880]   the big lesson. card is how many
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.400]   billions do they have to raise? Let's
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.120]   pull up this chart here. This is super
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.040]   telling to pull up, you know, who made
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.800]   money and I think this shows you what
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.640]   happens in a ZURP environment when
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.120]   people do not look at entry price. The
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.360]   series C underwater, no, no, seriously,
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.720]   not underwater. Everybody from F on is
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.680]   kind of underwater. And everybody from
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.160]   the series C is underwater compared to
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.160]   the S&P 500 to your point free free
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.640]   bars broke even and then everybody who
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.120]   invested in 2020 and 2021 actually lost
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.360]   money. General catalyst, DST, D1, TRO,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Fidelity, all the late stage folks, even
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.120]   Sequoia was in that late stage at series
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.840]   I in 2021, when it was worth 39 billion.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.960]   So but that whole environment not only
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.320]   was it bad for all the late stage
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.160]   investors who invested at too high a
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.440]   price, I would argue that it was bad for
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.040]   the companies and even their early stage
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.800]   investors because these companies got so
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.360]   inefficient.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.000]   The dilution is ridiculous. Yeah.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.800]   dilution was ridiculous. I also think you
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.720]   have to think about this in the context
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.920]   of what your alternative returns are. I
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.080]   think that we always look at these
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.920]   numbers and we think we try to make
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.760]   judgments but if you put yourself into
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.280]   the mindset of an investor, it's actually
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.200]   the alternative of what you could have
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.360]   gotten and it's the spread between the
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.960]   two that's really important. So Nick,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.400]   you want to just throw up this image that
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.320]   I just sent you. This is an example that
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.080]   I saw an axios I thought that this
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.160]   visualization by the way, I want to try
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.000]   to use this visualization in the future.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.240]   Because it tries to really it just
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.560]   paints a very clear picture. Let's let's
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.680]   sports picture shows is essentially and
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.520]   this uses Instacart as an example, but
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.120]   you could use it for any company, but it
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.040]   just basically shows you at every point
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.480]   in which you could have invested money
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.120]   in Instacart. What would the equivalent
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.800]   return have been had you just invested
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.960]   that same amount of money in the S&P 500.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.280]   And the difference between that is what
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.160]   you would call the alpha, right? Because
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.680]   the S&P 500 is the beta meaning it is
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.280]   what the market's going to do, it'll be
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.400]   up 10%, it'll be down 4%, whatever. And so
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.000]   by owning the market, you get that. If you
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.760]   decide to not own the market and make an
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.240]   explicit decision like owning Instacart,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.760]   then you get a different return stream.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.280]   And if you compare the two, you know how
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.560]   much better or worse you would have been.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.200]   So what this chart shows, for example, is
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.040]   the series F investor in 2018. If you had
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.960]   taken $1 and put it into Instacart would
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.160]   have gotten 13%. But if you had put $1 into
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.720]   the S&P 500, you would have gotten 68%.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.880]   In the series C in 2015, had you invested
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.680]   $1 in Instacart, you would have made 153%.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.840]   But the S&P would have returned 121. The
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.920]   difference means that the series C
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:16.080]   investor generated about 32% alpha. Now
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.680]   then the decision you have to make is
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.560]   that 32% of incremental gain over the last
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.880]   seven years or eight years, was it worth
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.840]   it? You're not liquid. And because you
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.080]   have to then solve for illiquidity and
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.920]   other things. And this is the math that I
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.000]   think all of the LPs will be engaged in,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.400]   they'll be doing these calculations. It
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.160]   just goes back to what Saksis point said,
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.680]   which is, our business, frankly, did very
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.600]   well in moments where we had zero interest
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.160]   rates. Our business now when prevailing
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.760]   rates are at five or 6%. And you can own
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.920]   those things or you can own structured
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.320]   credit for 11 to 13%. Our business,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.400]   unfortunately, does not look so good. And
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.320]   when people do the calculations on what
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.240]   the true alpha of venture capital is,
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.680]   they're going to come back with answers
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.400]   like this, which is it's not that great.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.000]   And I do think it will impact how limited
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.560]   partners have an appetite to give all of
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.560]   us or you guys folks that are that are
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.920]   accepting LP checks, more money, because
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.560]   the alternative universe is more liquid.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.720]   It's less volatile. And it has roughly
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.680]   the same amount of return,
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.040]   I can tell you what they're saying,
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.760]   because I'm doing about a dozen LP
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.000]   meetings a week. And I've got 50 more on
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.360]   the calendar to the end of the year. So
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.200]   I'm going to hit 100 of these meetings.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.640]   They're really saying two things. One,
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.000]   we want to go earlier, we don't want to
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.640]   go later. As that chart proves, they're
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.160]   suddenly fascinated with the seed and
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.200]   series a rounds. And they're looking for
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.880]   distinctly different strategies. They're
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.280]   looking for some sort of edge. So the
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.520]   first two questions are how early are you
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   getting in and securing a 10% position in
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.920]   this company? And then what's your edge?
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.080]   And literally the start of my pitch deck
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.560]   now, when I walk people through it is, I
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.960]   have two podcasts, one of them gets 50
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.240]   million listens a year, the other one
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   gets over 50 million listens a year,
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.400]   those 100 million listens result in 20,000
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.240]   applications, I have larger deal flow
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.640]   than anybody, with the only exception
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.800]   being Y Combinator. And that resonates
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.040]   with folks. But if you're somebody who's
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.120]   got a new fund, and you're like, what's
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.560]   your what's your edge? I go to, you know,
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.040]   some demo days, that's not an edge. You
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.440]   have to have a massive competitive edge
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.520]   and a differentiated you have to be
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.560]   differentiated in some very credible,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.000]   believable way. And they're telling me
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.080]   the same thing. They're cutting two funds
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.840]   out of their 20. And then they're cutting
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.000]   their commitments to the weaker ones of
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.680]   the other 18. I have a question for all
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.040]   of you guys. You had a wonderful question,
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.400]   which we never touched guys, what do you
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.040]   guys think about the arm business model
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.840]   or the clavio business model? You guys
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.040]   had a chance to look at any of those
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.880]   companies and think about that? Let me
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.320]   take the facts and then you guys respond.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.000]   The revenue is up 15% year over year 716
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.640]   million ad revenues 206 million. That's
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.520]   on pace to make up 28% of their revenue.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.960]   This is just the last quarter I'm
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.320]   talking about it right here and to June
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.040]   30 net income 114 million. They have
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.200]   600,000 instacart shoppers. Those are
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.440]   like the drivers to give them like
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.000]   door dashers or Uber drivers 7.7 million
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.080]   monthly active orders. The red flags is
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.320]   that their gross transaction volume,
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.080]   which is the value of all of the
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.480]   groceries in the in the bags is flat,
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.560]   but ad revenue is growing. This means ad
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.040]   revenue is just a massively larger
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.960]   percentage of the total revenue. They
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.000]   think they can, you know, they're on
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.680]   track for 800 million in ad revenue. So
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.360]   this is starting to look not like a
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.760]   e commerce business, but more like a
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.320]   an advertising business. Your thoughts,
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.960]   free burger socks on the actual car
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.520]   business.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.520]   Amazon, by the way, has a dynamic to now
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.440]   have you seen the chart showing
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.280]   advertising on Amazon compared to the
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.400]   entire internet?
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.440]   Yes, it's huge. And also, Uber's blown
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.040]   past a billion, I believe. Here's what
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.800]   we know, we know that advertising
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.640]   multiples, broadly speaking, have
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.800]   contracted. Right. So I think that the
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.760]   market in general, doesn't love that
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.320]   revenue quality, because it's too
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.160]   levered to interest rates in the
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.160]   economy. So when the economy does well,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.600]   more companies advertise when the
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   economy doesn't do well, companies
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.120]   advertise less. That's number one. And
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.240]   number two, the ones that can
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.920]   systematically drive advertising more
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.160]   broadly, the Facebook's and the Google's
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.680]   of the world tend to get an increasing
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.080]   share. So advertising as a revenue
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.680]   stream, I think is, is good and
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.760]   complimentary. Unfortunately, the
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.240]   markets don't necessarily love it. And
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.440]   then the second thing, generally
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.440]   speaking for these businesses that
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.760]   drive huge GTVs, gross transaction
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.720]   values is, I think most people when they
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.360]   try to find what they're worth, are very
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.080]   sensitive to the take rate. And what
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.560]   they typically do is they assume a
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.720]   falling take rate, which means what
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.160]   percentage of the transaction can you
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.080]   get. And the reason why most people do
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.640]   that is that history has shown that
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.840]   these kinds of businesses cannot defend
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.840]   take rate for a very long period of
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.320]   time. Whether it's for competitive
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   pressure, or whether it's because their
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.400]   suppliers actually develop more pricing
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.560]   power, take rate tends to decay. So said
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.160]   in you know, in grocery land, I think
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:23.760]   it's because Walmart and Amazon will
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.840]   try to do it for much, much cheaper and
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.760]   will try to find or charge, just be more
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.880]   aggressive in how much they they want to
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.480]   keep, which means it's less that you can
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.320]   maybe necessarily pass through. I don't
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.840]   know the instacart business at all. But
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.440]   if I were starting to look at it, that's
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.360]   where I would focus is, what are the
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.760]   assumptions on take rate. And if the
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.920]   take rate is going up, and it would be a
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.440]   little bit of a head scratcher, I think
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.920]   that you have to model the health of the
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.400]   business with a declining growth share.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.920]   I can actually build on that pretty
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.760]   easily. Having spent a long time in the
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.000]   market, I think if this was very
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.320]   profitable advertising Chamath, it would
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:04.240]   get a 25 x multiple on earnings. Let's
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.040]   take that 800 million, you put it at 400
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.400]   million in profits, like if the other
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.080]   business didn't exist, so you have 400
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.000]   million in profits of advertising times
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.360]   that by 20, you get a billion. That's
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.720]   exactly their market cap. So perhaps what
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.520]   you're saying is exactly what the market
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.160]   is, is actually penciling out Google,
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.200]   which obviously has a lot of other
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.440]   companies, like Google has 28 x p, and
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.560]   Facebook is crushed at like 35 p. But
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.280]   these are much different scale, and scale
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.640]   matters. This is not one or 2 billion in
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.040]   you know, a little extra revenue on top
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.280]   of your business. That's the entirety 90
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.680]   95% of that. I think what's working in
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.040]   favor of Instacart is that if you
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.520]   compare it to probably Uber and DoorDash,
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.200]   or Airbnb, at least, Airbnb dash, I'm
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.880]   pretty cheap. Now I think of all the
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.640]   three businesses dash probably has the
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.200]   biggest upside. Quite just like again,
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.720]   arm's length. I don't I don't know in
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.840]   any of these three stocks. I'm just
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.480]   saying business model quality dash seems
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.560]   infinitely scalable. Airbnb, I think
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.920]   probably has long term issues with take
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   because of this exact reason, because
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.000]   just competitive dynamics and pressure,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.080]   regulatory capture. You're seeing that in
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.320]   New York for Airbnb. And then the
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.880]   question is, what is the business
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.240]   outside the United States look like for
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.480]   Instacart? I don't know. But if I had to
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.320]   figure out what to pay for, that's how I
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.920]   would kind of try to break the problem
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   down. Saks, any of your thoughts on the
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.280]   actual business here? Or do you want to
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.440]   jump over to Clavia? Yeah, I think
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.120]   Clavia is the really interesting one,
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.600]   at least from my standpoint, because a
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.080]   software business. I think Jason Lemkin
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.880]   had the take here. He said that Clavia
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.560]   is IPL be the ultimate yardstick for
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.520]   SAS and 23 and 24. Top growth, top
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.360]   margins, top founders going to cruise
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.400]   past a billion in ARR, whatever multiple
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.680]   they end up trading at you home is
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.440]   certainly worth less. I think it's
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.160]   trading at about 12 times for revenue.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:07.680]   So just AR last quarter, they did 165
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.680]   billion. I started 65 million. Sorry.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.240]   Yeah, so they're at 650 million in ARR
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.080]   growing 56%. That's amazing. So you're
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.480]   over you 51% of your so you know,
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.000]   project that for they're probably gonna
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.160]   be at a billion and ARR next year. 119%
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.160]   NRR, which is very good, especially
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.680]   considering that is folks, it's not
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.440]   revenue retention. It's the way to think
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.040]   about that is if you just look at your
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.400]   existing customers, going into next year,
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.480]   what percent of that subscription base
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.720]   is going to be there. And if it was 80%
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.040]   of would be 20% of your customers are
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.920]   turning away. If it's 119%, it means you
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.240]   have expansion from your customer base.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.480]   In other words, your customers are buying
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.280]   more. And there will be some who churn,
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.720]   but the ones who are expanding more than
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.240]   make up for that. And then they've been
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.000]   very capital efficient. Apparently,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.760]   they've only burned 15 million today.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.200]   That does not mean they've only raised
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.600]   15 million. They've raised several 100
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.840]   million in various growth rounds, but
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.280]   they've still got that money in the bank.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.320]   So I assume they raised it as a cushion
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.680]   in case they missed their forecast or
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.600]   something like that. Yeah, it seems like
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.360]   a pretty strong business. But I think
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.920]   his point is right is that they're kind
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.440]   of the ceiling, you know. So I think
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.040]   founders still have maybe unrealistic
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.120]   expectations from the days when
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.800]   SAS businesses were being valued 100
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.400]   times ARR. Have you had this
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.640]   conversation, Sax, with folks coming in
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.880]   for funding who have great businesses,
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.160]   or let's call them good to great
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.440]   businesses, somewhere in that zone,
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.520]   there's seven, eight, nine businesses,
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.240]   but their valuations are way off. And do
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.920]   you do you bring up, hey, here's what
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.280]   your your company would be worth
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   publicly. This is what your last round
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.120]   is. And then trying to negotiate in
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   between those two numbers, because it
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.920]   does seem like founders are bringing
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.840]   that up proactively in some meetings
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.280]   with me, they're actually aware of
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.840]   public comps now. And they're kind of
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.200]   admitting, hey, I get it kind of
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.720]   situation. Yeah, I think founder
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.400]   expectations have adjusted on this.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.560]   Yeah, which is healthy. Yeah, when
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.840]   you're in a hot market, there's
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.720]   definitely a lot of sharing among
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.040]   founders of what's happening and where
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.640]   valuations are at. And I think the same
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.600]   thing is probably happening in the
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.520]   down market as well. So yeah, I think
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.800]   everyone's getting more realistic.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.240]   Yeah, just to finish on Clavio, I just
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.680]   want to give a shout out to Toby looky.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.160]   The best thing that I saw about that
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.040]   was that Shopify actually owns like 11%
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.600]   of this company, which I think like if
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.240]   you look at the corporations, again,
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.680]   just doing an incredible job of
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.360]   building an ecosystem, not only does
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.800]   Toby support these companies, but
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.640]   Shopify ends up owning a huge non
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.240]   trivial portion, I think Shopify owns
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.840]   like 11 or 12% of Clavio. And then I
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.960]   think with the sale of the Flexport
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.720]   deliver back to Flexport, they own 13
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.920]   or 14% of it. I suspect they probably
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.800]   own a non trivial share of stripe. I
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.200]   say it's incredible, right? If you do
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.760]   some of the parts on Shopify, their
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.680]   cash and cash and then cash equivalents
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.040]   are only valued at like two or 3
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.480]   billion. So I feel like there's a ton of
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.840]   upside there just for free. Again, I
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.960]   don't own it. I haven't done the work.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.720]   But I'm just saying seems like seems
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.920]   like it's great.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.080]   He's a great. Yeah. So I think that
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.280]   brings up a really interesting point,
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.080]   which is the only vulnerability or
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.840]   negative I think about Clavio's
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.720]   business is the fact that 70% of it is
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.600]   on Shopify. So that's a platform
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.160]   dependency. And whenever 70% of your
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.760]   business is on one platform, you always
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.800]   have to be afraid of getting the rug
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.560]   pulled out from under you. By the way,
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.320]   that was PayPal's problem back in the
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.880]   day, 20 years ago, 70% of our business
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.280]   was on eBay. eBay had a competitor,
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.800]   we're constantly worried that they were
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.720]   going to pull the rug out from under us.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.920]   If we could have made a business deal
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.440]   with eBay, we would never have had to
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.640]   sell the company, it would have been
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.360]   ideal. I think Clavio was really smart,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.680]   creating alignment with Shopify, by
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.840]   letting them invest, giving them equity,
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   doing a rev share agreement. And they
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.920]   would be smart to continue that rev
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.240]   share agreement into the future to take
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   this risk off the table. Because
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.000]   investors do not like existential risk,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.920]   you can have a perfect business. But if
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.000]   there's some hard to quantify risk of
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.360]   the whole thing, basically getting rug
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.600]   pulled, then how do you discount that?
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.360]   David, as an investor, you look at that
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.360]   and you're like, okay, I then price this
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.880]   company as a function of Shopify.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.480]   That's a good point. I mean, 70% of the
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.320]   business is Shopify. The way I would look
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.880]   at it is, I would price it as a SaaS
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.240]   business, because Shopify is more of a
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.920]   transact, well, they're a transactional
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.880]   slash SaaS business. Clavio is a pure
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.560]   SaaS business, I'd price as a SaaS
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.640]   business, but I would have to create some
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.320]   sort of discount for the chance that,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.040]   you know, that the
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.960]   rug pull discount. Well, Shopify adds the
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.520]   features.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.960]   How do you figure that out? That's a
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.800]   really complicated thing to figure out.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.360]   Hey, I agree.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.600]   But I think that Clavio mitigates the
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.880]   risk to the extent they do this, like,
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.680]   rough share agreement.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.440]   It's a really savvy move for people who
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.920]   have insights into the market to own
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   pieces of emerging companies and lock in
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.400]   that partnership. This was Emil, Michael,
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.120]   shout out at Uber, and Travis did this
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.400]   with all of the grabs, DDs, etc. And then
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.880]   Dara just slowly sold those positions,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.440]   and they were incredible cash
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   accretive to that stock and to running
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.760]   that business. Let's talk about Airtable
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.480]   for a second. This also trended on
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.320]   Twitter with a tweet storm. If you don't
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.640]   know what Airtable is, it's kind of like...
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.520]   What is it?
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.200]   It's like Excel meets a database, and
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.680]   it's more programmable. So if you wanted
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.320]   to have a bunch of data...
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:26.960]   Who uses it?
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.680]   A lot of small businesses use it,
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.000]   medium-sized businesses, and they use it
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.880]   to, let's say, instead of hiring somebody
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.600]   to build a database system, or...
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.120]   It's like Google Sheets on steroids.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.240]   It's actually a really good product.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.440]   And I've seen it used... It's a really sick
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.080]   product. Yeah.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.000]   I've seen it used like 10 different ways.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.640]   Some people use it for tracking product
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.160]   feature requests and, you know, task lists.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   Some people use it for contact database.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.240]   Some people use it for complex project
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.840]   management. It's super extensible,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.920]   super easy to use, and a great
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.800]   collaborative tool.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.040]   Yeah, think about it. It's like a
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.280]   spreadsheet for words instead of numbers.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.040]   Yeah. Yeah. But you could also do numbers.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.880]   So with a lot of great features that you
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.800]   can do really dynamic things within the
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.360]   spreadsheet. It's pretty powerful.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.760]   Do you guys believe in this Swiss Army
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.520]   Knife approach of building these kinds
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.040]   of things, or do you believe that it's
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.000]   just cheaper and simpler to build best-in-class
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.440]   versions of each of those use cases,
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.240]   Friedberg, that you just mentioned?
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.000]   Well, I think it allows certain businesses
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.840]   to have a very specific, tunable version
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.600]   of what they need from, call it a project
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.880]   management tool. So if you use a
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.400]   traditional project management tool,
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.760]   it may be too overbuilt, or it may be too
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.440]   specific, whereas this tool allows you
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.640]   to build something unique for your
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.240]   platform. So that's where I've seen a
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.920]   lot of teams use it instead of other
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.840]   tools like JIRA, or whatever for
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.560]   tracking.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.080]   Well, this is the point. I just wonder
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.920]   that you get these small, non-scalable
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.080]   use cases, because then if a company is
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.440]   successful, don't they then just migrate
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.480]   to JIRA, for example?
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.240]   No, I view it a lot like spreadsheets.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.920]   Basically, the reason people use
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.280]   spreadsheets for so many different
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.640]   things is because everyone's got their
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   own representation of data and
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.000]   utilization of a spreadsheet. And I
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.600]   think this is just an extension of that.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.120]   It's a cult. Think about it as a more
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.560]   feature-rich spreadsheet tool.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.160]   I actually think that Jamal's question
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.320]   is an excellent one. I tweeted many
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.560]   years ago that the way I saw Excel was
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   the long tail of use cases that hadn't
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.640]   moved into a dedicated SaaS app yet.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.280]   That's interesting.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.520]   And that the way that if you wanted to
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.720]   be a SaaS founder, you're trying to come
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.760]   up with ideas, find some really
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.000]   complicated Excel spreadsheet that's
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.160]   used across many different businesses,
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.440]   and just figure out if you can move that
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.960]   into a SaaS app. So for example, think
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.000]   about Carta. Before Carta, people just
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.680]   use a spreadsheet for the cap table.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.400]   And every company had a cap table
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:42.880]   spreadsheet.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.840]   Totally.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.360]   But they just move that into a specific
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.120]   SaaS app. So I think there's a lot of
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.320]   that. And so...
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.160]   And all a spreadsheet is, it's a visual
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.760]   representation of a database with some
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.840]   relational logic that you build into the
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.960]   cells of the spreadsheet.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.400]   And this pattern of breaking apart a
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.560]   major product was the playbook for
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.080]   Craigslist. People looked at Craigslist
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.920]   and said, "Oh, there's couch surfing.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.560]   Make that Airbnb. Oh, there's a ride
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.480]   sharing. I'm going to LA. I have two
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.040]   extra seats." That became like Uber.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.560]   So people, this playbook has existed.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.920]   There's a great visual of that too, where
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.400]   every category on Craigslist became
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.200]   its own dedicated marketplace.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.800]   Like five startups. Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.360]   Onlyfans.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.000]   Oh, TaskRabbit was one.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.040]   Well, you know, so everybody uses
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.560]   Freeberg. Everybody uses Craigslist for
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.680]   something different. It's interesting
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.040]   that it comes to you. That's the one that
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:27.440]   comes first.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.120]   Craigslist was a huge dating product
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.160]   before dating apps came out.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.240]   It was. Casual encounters or missed...
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:32.880]   What was it called?
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.160]   Missed connections.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.040]   Missed connections.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.720]   Missed connections was hilarious to read.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.360]   It was like me, you, the number four train.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.720]   I think the point, though, the question
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.800]   that I was asking is exactly this, which
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.760]   is, you have these beefed up workflow
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.200]   things that happen in Excel, but then
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.600]   eventually you go to these systems of
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.160]   record that are purpose-built to solve
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.320]   the use case, and if the use case is
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.840]   important enough, it just seems like
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.040]   that's what's happened. I don't have a
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.080]   view because I've never used the
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.160]   product, but I wonder whether part of
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   this valuation reset doesn't reflect
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.200]   that dynamic.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.440]   It is a dynamic. The two companies or
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.560]   yeah, two or three companies that
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.400]   represent it best is there's a product
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.840]   called Coda, which is part wiki, part
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.600]   air table, part database, and it's
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.960]   programmable and Notion. And now people
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.600]   are making templates in Notion, and then
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.160]   they're adding things like project
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.320]   management. So I asked my team to do
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.040]   project management for events, and they
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   tried Basecamp, they were looking at
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.040]   Asana, and then somebody was like, you
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.880]   know what, I just added it to Notion,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.720]   it's good enough. It's not as good as
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.080]   those other two products, but it's good
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.920]   enough. And we don't have to, and the
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.120]   reason they want to do is not because
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.160]   we're cheap, I don't want to spend money
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.760]   on another SaaS product. We don't want
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.120]   to have to teach everybody a new SaaS
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.720]   product. We don't have to want to do the
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.520]   logins for that. So I think it is a
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.960]   natural tension and people are doing
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.440]   both Chamathville. Some people like the
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.000]   best of breed, but you're also seeing it,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.760]   I don't know if you saw this past week,
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.680]   Slack added, I think during Dreamforce,
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.920]   the ability to give you an AI summary of
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.520]   everything you missed, and then Zoom
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.960]   added AI summaries of calls. So that
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.840]   feature that I guess Otter and some
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   other people were doing, that feature is
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.320]   now built into Zoom, you get a transcript
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.480]   from Zoom for free, and now you get a
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.960]   summary of the call for free. That is
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.600]   work that was done by somebody on the
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.960]   meeting, right? Somebody was responsible
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.720]   for being the note taker. Sometimes
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.560]   somebody was, so those are jobs that are
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   gone. And I think it speaks to the bigger
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.640]   economy. I had the CEO of Kayak on this
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.160]   week and startups this week, it'll come
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.920]   out next week. He's really great. And I
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.680]   asked him about hiring and the size of
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.040]   the company said, I'm not hiring anybody
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.280]   in the next year or two. Because all my
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.120]   developers are 30 or 40% better. I got
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.560]   junior developers that are acting like
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.760]   senior developers. I got senior
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.360]   developers who are turning into 10x
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.040]   developers, we're not hiring, we're just
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.240]   going to have increased margin.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.000]   So what happened to Airtable?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.200]   Airtable had a massive valuation. Here's
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.000]   the tweet storm. That somebody from CB
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.560]   Insights, this guy Anand, who I think I
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.120]   follow him.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.040]   Oh, so did something happen or nothing?
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.480]   Well, they're most recently valued at
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.040]   11.7 billion in December, their 2021
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.360]   series app. His thesis, not only is
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.680]   Airtable worth less than 11.7 billion,
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.720]   it's likely worth less than the 1.4
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.960]   billion in funding it has raised to
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.200]   free birds been bringing this point up
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.880]   over and over about the overfunding and
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.480]   cash in is less than the valuation.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.400]   Most Yeah, most of these unicorns are
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.720]   worth less than their total press stack.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.400]   This is a good example. I've just been
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.080]   through this this week I went I saw it
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.440]   as a company I was an investor in that I
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.080]   saw this happen.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.720]   Airtable on track to do their big
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.880]   problem is I mean, they're doing over 100
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.200]   million of ARR. It's a it's a great
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.400]   product and 150 million of ARR. That's no
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.320]   small feat. The problem is the growth
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.920]   rate, I think it's only 15%.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.200]   What do you do with the founders, Saks?
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.360]   Because this was my point earlier, is in
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.120]   these circumstances, it's still a good
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.800]   business, investors are going to want to
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.960]   own these shares at some price, someone
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.880]   will buy new shares at some price. But
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.640]   to do this transaction, given that the
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.400]   preference in the company, which is
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.920]   effectively debt is greater than the
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.760]   value of the company, the founders and
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.440]   the employees get their ownership stakes
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.280]   wiped out. So if you want, I think
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.360]   they're only hope, I think their only
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.040]   hope is to go public because that wipes
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.320]   out the press stack and everyone
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.520]   basically just owns their percentage of
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.600]   the company. If they don't go public.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.160]   And if a private investor do that, why
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.840]   would a preferred investor allow that to
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.560]   happen?
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.760]   Well, this is going to be the huge
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   tension on the board is that if you're a
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.600]   common holder, or if you're one of the
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.440]   early investors, the company, you want to
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.960]   go public. If you're a late stage
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.160]   investor, you don't want to give up
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.120]   your preference.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.360]   But those late stage people Saks did not
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.440]   have blocker rights in many cases,
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.120]   because the market market was so hot,
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.040]   they just put the money in without.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.640]   Yeah, I mean, unless they had a ratchet
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.760]   into the IPO, but yeah,
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.120]   yeah, but in many cases, but that's not a
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.240]   universal truth, right? In almost in the
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.720]   majority of these cases, the preferred
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.080]   shareholders do have significant
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.160]   representation on the board, they do have
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.360]   the ability to influence whether or not
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.480]   the company is going to go public. And
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.240]   there's likely some middle ground that
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   every company ends up having to meet at,
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.440]   which is we're going to recap the
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.560]   company in a way that we're going to
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.800]   give some shares, newly issued shares,
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.960]   the founders, what we saw in our dash
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.120]   door, they got dragged along after
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.880]   Yeah, that indoor dash, I think they all
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.400]   just got dragged out, they didn't have a
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.160]   choice. The my understanding of some of
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160]   these late rounds during peak Zerp
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.760]   2020 21 from talking to Bill Gurley was
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.360]   people did not negotiate those rights,
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.040]   those rights, the blocker rights weren't
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.640]   available. And if the majority of common
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.840]   says we're going public, you're going
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.760]   public. And that's the that's the end of
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.600]   the story. Here's here's the punchline to
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.880]   the air table. If you look at the Ford
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.680]   price to sales multiple 78 x for an
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.400]   $11.7 billion valuation at 150 million
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.040]   ARR, and you compare it to the trailing
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.880]   price to sales multiples in the project
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.600]   management space Mondays at 12 x plus
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.880]   Asana 6.6 x and smart sheets at just
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.040]   around eight x. So it's a challenge.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.520]   Yeah, well, to freeberg's point, one of
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.160]   the downsides of taking all this
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.920]   excessive capital at these ridiculous
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.400]   valuations is that it produces a dynamic
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.800]   in your boardroom, where your board
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.640]   members are at war with each other. The
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.920]   late stage investors are gonna be at war
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.600]   with the early stage investors and the
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.000]   founders. And who knows who comes out on
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.800]   top of that. I don't know if you guys
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.960]   have but I've got like so many anecdotes
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.400]   over the last couple of months on this
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.240]   exact scenario playing out. We'll take
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.120]   us through an amalgamation of those, you
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.240]   know, without talking about specific
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.600]   ones, but you know, you can make
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.840]   your own automation, what is the dynamic
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.200]   and how does it work itself out
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.720]   investor invested a multi billion dollar
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.000]   valuation, the company is now worth 20%
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.880]   of that valuation. And the investors have
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.480]   more money in the company than it is
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.200]   worth. And the company needs more cash.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.120]   They can't go public at this rate,
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.480]   because the markets are shut down, no
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.440]   one's going to buy new shares, they
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.600]   can't raise cash by going public. So
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.280]   they have to raise cash in the private
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.440]   markets. So then the tough question is,
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.200]   okay, what's the value of the company,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.600]   in almost all of these cases, the CEO has
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.880]   been replaced. Or there was some
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.320]   professional CEO. So there's a new
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.720]   option pool created equal to 10 to 15%
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.880]   of the company, new options are issued,
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.720]   and around is done at a significant
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.400]   discount. And there's a huge recap and a
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.240]   pay to play. And all this other sort of
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.000]   stuff starts to play out that the
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.520]   original founders in the company get
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.200]   wiped out most of the management team
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.960]   leaves, because their options are now
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.120]   worthless. And the investors who
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.880]   historically have been totally passive
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.360]   late stage investors have had to step in
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.800]   and try and take action and rebuilding
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.000]   a management team, which guess what
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.160]   they're not necessarily good at. And so
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.920]   it ends up becoming this really nasty
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.600]   unwinding of the business, because
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.360]   everyone thinks, oh, well, I deserve to
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.520]   get a fair deal, because I put money in
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.200]   and I have a preference in this company.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.400]   founders don't want to see their
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.320]   ownership go down from 20% to 2%.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.080]   They're like, why would I keep working
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.480]   for 2%? I'm fully vested. I'm going to
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.840]   leave the management teams like, wait a
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.960]   second, I'm getting offers left and
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.880]   right to go join other companies. And so
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.960]   it's a real kind of nasty unwinding. And
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.480]   I think that's the scary scenario that's
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.480]   likely going to play out and not all but
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.240]   a good chunk of these companies that are
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.680]   there are still businesses, they have
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680]   decent value to their business. But they
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.360]   just raise too much capital relative to
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.720]   the valuation of the business today.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.400]   If you looked at it on a blank piece of
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.640]   paper, these businesses look incredible
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.680]   at whatever the true valuation is today.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.920]   But if you have the psychological
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.560]   hindsight bias of what the price was two
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.360]   years ago, you just can't see that.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.040]   You can't get it totally can't get it.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.640]   By the way, I will say the structure,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.200]   there's like legacy structure in the cap
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.600]   table from Yeah, yeah, meaning there's
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   like this prep stack. I will say that the
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.800]   terms are so crazy good for the recap,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.600]   that investors are clawing their way into
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.240]   the recap round. Well, that means I get
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.160]   the nature markets are healing. That's
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.680]   means we're in the endgame. Right?
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.520]   That's part of what's happening. Part of
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.440]   what's happening is it's totally
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.200]   predatory. It's totally predatory.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.400]   What I've seen is when you're going to
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.400]   be able to go public again, I think that
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.040]   when there's a recap, and the founder is
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.160]   still running the company, there's a
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.840]   chance of it being fair. But when they
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.880]   bring in a new CEO, who then does a recap,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.240]   Oh, yeah, they don't care.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.200]   They don't care. They don't care.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.440]   Exactly. And all these recaps turn into
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.000]   a disaster.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.280]   Yeah, well, it's recap, or you're going
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.360]   to go out of business. So I mean, this is
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.520]   a force and function and everybody party
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.600]   too hard. I think it's time for
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.920]   everybody's favorite part of the show,
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.520]   which is to give Chamath his flowers.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.760]   Here we go. Chamath, the Fed spoke this
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:36.080]   week. And it's time for Chamath to take
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.480]   his victory lap. Here he goes, everybody.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.000]   Chamath, this is Vangelis, yes.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.720]   Vangelis doing chariots of fire. This
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.280]   week, the Fed said to quote Chamath,
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   Well, this is about having connections
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.920]   to the deep state for longer.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.680]   There he is, there's Chamath leading the
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.560]   pack. I sent my talking points from six
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.280]   months ago to our friend, Deep State
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.320]   sent the note and Deep State sent it to
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.400]   the Fed and the Fed just cut and pasted
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.000]   it into the press.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.800]   We'll stay higher for longer.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.400]   Are we going to get a copyright on this?
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.280]   We're going to get a copyright on this.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.240]   We don't care. Who cares?
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.760]   I don't think anyone understands what it
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.880]   is that Chamath said that he's taking
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.000]   the victory lap on. Why don't you set
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:26.720]   that up, J.K.L.?
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.840]   That rates will stay higher for longer.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.840]   And now he takes his victory lap.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.280]   All right, enough of this shenanigans.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.840]   Chamath said rates will stay higher for
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840]   longer. The Fed said rates will stay
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.040]   higher for longer. The end.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.560]   Congratulations, Chamath. You got it right.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.400]   Thanks. Okay.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.440]   Well, let's actually talk about-
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.400]   Every week we're going to give our
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.360]   chariots a fire.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.080]   Oh, look, Chamath is receiving a medal.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.640]   Here he is.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.720]   Chamath can give himself a medal in the
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.280]   group chat.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.160]   This is Obama.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.240]   This is when Obama, who is Obama giving
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.840]   the medal to? What's the real picture
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.200]   here? It's Obama.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:01.920]   Is he giving it to Biden?
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.800]   Giving the medal to Obama?
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.360]   To Biden.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.280]   I think he's giving it to Biden.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:05.840]   Obama's giving it to himself.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.280]   Biden thought it was so-
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.640]   Oh, Chamath giving a medal to Chamath.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.600]   So I think what happened this week is
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.880]   actually pretty important because I think
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.040]   the markets were really trying to force
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.400]   Jerome Powell to start the cutting cycle.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.880]   And now they had to move the date at which
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.240]   they could expect cuts out by a year.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.840]   And I think that we're only starting to
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.520]   see the reverberations of that.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.480]   You're going to have to reprice a lot of
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.680]   risk assets.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.640]   So if you put it all together, oil is
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.520]   creeping back up.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:48.800]   So commodity prices essentially are
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.520]   trending up.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.880]   I don't think that's going to have a big
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.800]   impact on inflation because of the way
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.880]   that owner equivalent rents and core CPI
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.560]   is calculated because it's calculated on
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.600]   this six-month lag, this dumb nonsense of
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.520]   just how arcane our system works, but
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.920]   that's going to spike down.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.400]   So basically, the Fed's like saying, we
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.680]   know all of this is happening, we're
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.880]   sitting on our hands.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.360]   But the problem is that if you add another
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.560]   100 basis points to your discount rate
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.640]   for an unprofitable SaaS company, my gosh,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.000]   guys, you're taking like another turn and
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.240]   a half of market cap out of the business.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.080]   Like if you thought it was worth eight
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.240]   times, it's now worth six and a half,
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:32.960]   six times.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.160]   So unfortunately, that's going to hurt
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.240]   everything that's not the top seven tech
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:40.800]   companies.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.080]   And everything else is just going to just
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.560]   kind of meander along for a much longer
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:48.880]   time.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.440]   So it's really good for the magnificent
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:51.760]   seven.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.160]   I think it's really bad for everything
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:54.660]   else.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:56.960]   And we're going to be in a holding
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.080]   pattern for a while.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:04.720]   Crude oil is at, let's see, $89 a barrel.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.800]   Yeah, it's, it's, you know, I told
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.400]   remember, remember this conversation, I
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.280]   told my CEOs, guys, let's get enough cash
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.600]   to last through the middle of 25.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:13.920]   Sure.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.440]   Remember, I was pretty clear about that
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.720]   to folks, I mean, get to get to default
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.040]   alive.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.880]   But if you can't, please have enough
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.320]   money to the mid of 25.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.760]   I think that that was wrong.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.520]   I think now you got to be q1 of 26.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.560]   And maybe even mid 26.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.400]   So now I have to go back to all these
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.480]   CEOs and redo an entire justification for
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.400]   why they need to cut even more people,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.360]   cut even more expense, cut more burn.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.600]   I don't know where we're going to find
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.320]   another year of burn in most of these
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:46.880]   businesses.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.520]   So I was wrong by at least a year, Jason,
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.240]   because of this.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.520]   I think I got the words right.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.640]   But I got the timing wrong.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.560]   Yeah, just to just to further translate
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:54.800]   this.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.960]   Okay, so the markets right now are
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.000]   definitely taking a bath.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.960]   The growth stocks are off significantly.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.560]   Expect them to be off more.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.560]   And the reason is because the market
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.480]   had started to price in rate cuts next
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:06.720]   year.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.560]   And now the Fed is saying that because
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   inflation ticked up a little bit,
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.320]   it's not coming down as much.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.160]   We have higher energy prices.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.480]   We may not get those rate cuts.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.320]   I think the Fed still maintains that
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.400]   we'll get 50 basis points of rate cuts
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.120]   next year.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.640]   But the market was pricing in more.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.600]   And I think people are starting to
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.360]   wonder if we'll even get the 50.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.000]   So as a result of that,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.360]   interest rates are going to stay higher
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.920]   longer, which means that risk capital
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.280]   will be less available.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.360]   So valuations are going to go down,
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.400]   or at least they're not going to be
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.640]   racing back up like they used to
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.080]   when I was saying mid 25.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.560]   Saks, that was because the forward
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.040]   curve started showing cuts in early 23.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.960]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.480]   So I was like, okay, let's assume
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.080]   they're wrong by 18 months.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.600]   It turns out that that initial data
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.720]   point in early 22.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.560]   My God, we were wrong by three years.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.040]   It's not a year and a half.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:18:59.280]   Right.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.000]   Brutal.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.080]   And I think the X factor here is that
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.480]   we're running almost $2 trillion
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.360]   deficits in peacetime.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.120]   Well, I mean, we're not in a direct war.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.560]   We're in a proxy war, but in relative
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.760]   peacetime and in a relatively
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.720]   decent economy.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.960]   So what happens if either of those
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:22.000]   things change and what happens to
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.040]   long-term rates as all of these debt
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.760]   issuances have to get raised, as the
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.840]   Fed has to keep selling more treasuries
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.920]   to fund our deficit and debt at these
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.840]   higher rates, do long-term rates keep
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.600]   going up based on the debt financing
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.880]   needs of the federal government.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.960]   And then this is again, where, you know,
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.360]   we made a huge mistake by politicizing
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.120]   this idea of raising money beyond 30
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.560]   years, we made that mistake under the
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.840]   Trump presidency, because people
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.240]   reacted to Trump saying it, but it was
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.600]   the smartest thing we could have done
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.920]   to give our kids and our grandkids a
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.040]   reasonable economy.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.760]   And Freeberg has been right all along
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.360]   about just like our spending is just
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.400]   going up and up and up.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.000]   And now short-term rates are really high.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.280]   Maybe we'll have enough political will
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.160]   to just get out of the Fed's way.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.080]   And the Fed can actually look at raising
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.520]   in durations past 30 years.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.000]   Because if you believe that we're going
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.920]   to start an aggressive cutting cycle at
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.640]   some point, and you believe we'll get
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.800]   back to like a 2% terminal rate, you
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.680]   could theoretically justify 50 60 year
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.960]   bonds at much lower than the 30 year,
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.720]   but I don't see it happening.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.400]   Here's a really good way to look at this.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.680]   There are prediction markets.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.720]   This one call she is when I use k lsh I
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.920]   chances of a rate cut by May of 2024 29%
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.200]   chance and these are people actually
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.720]   making bets on these things.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.040]   And so it has gotten pushed out.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.800]   And I guess 74% chance by the fourth
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.640]   quarter, third fourth quarter of next
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.080]   year, people think there'll be a rate cut.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.000]   So we're a year away from a rate cut.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.920]   Everybody needs to just take that off
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.320]   the table, which means the translation
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.760]   for founders for GPS is performance has
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.720]   to go up.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:15.280]   You got to beat 567% or whatever people
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.320]   are going to get on those other
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:16.800]   instruments.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.600]   Corporate debt, you know, 10 11 12%.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.760]   You got a really hard bogey to beat here.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.280]   The alternative to that statement is
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.160]   that total capital has to go down in
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.440]   order for the capital remaining to have
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.000]   its return multiple increased given that
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.760]   there's a generally set number of
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.200]   companies that are going to generally
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.880]   create a certain amount of value over
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.000]   the next couple of years.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.080]   And the way to create that value is so
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.440]   if that's true, well, I'm saying if
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.480]   there's a bunch of startups that are
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.080]   going to make $100 billion of market
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.840]   value over the next five to seven years,
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.560]   you need to have less capital going into
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.160]   those companies in order for that capital
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.280]   generate a higher return,
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.360]   which on your day to day basis means
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.280]   what freebird explain on a day to day
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.800]   basis on a day to day basis, it means
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.760]   there's gonna be less companies that
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.640]   are going to get funded, but more
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.840]   importantly, there's gonna be less LP
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.880]   money going into venture.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.800]   And there's going to be less capital
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.280]   available to fund startups in aggregate,
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.680]   by a significant amount on a daily basis,
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.920]   you need to do more with less as a
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.920]   founder, you need to delight customers
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.680]   with less resources, spend less money on
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.840]   marketing, send less money on teams and
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.440]   get to profitability, you've got to be
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.160]   a stronger founder. I'm seeing it across
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.000]   the board in the seed stage to three,
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.960]   four founders, raising 250 to a million
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.040]   instead of raising three to five.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.640]   I gotta be honest, you go, I thought it
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   was much easier to kind of say the sky
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.120]   was falling this time last year.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.960]   Right now.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.440]   And I think that people are a little bit
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.040]   again, exhausted about hearing this
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.800]   message constantly of like cup more.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.440]   It's like, I think that they're exhausted.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.720]   And I see a lot of founders that are
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.960]   exhausted and giving up. There's a lot
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.320]   of giving up. They're like, they're like,
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.040]   I can't cut anymore. And now I do think
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.360]   we have to go back to them and say, if
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.400]   we're doing our jobs, right. Okay, even
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.320]   okay, look, our now our strategic view
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.280]   was right. But the timescale of our
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.160]   analysis was wrong. And I think now you
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.800]   got to plan to mid 26. I don't even know
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.640]   where to start, to be honest with that.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.120]   Actually, that what I'm seeing is people
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.200]   are merging companies and m&a is picking
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.960]   up because hey, you got two companies
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.280]   doing 5 million each, but they're
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.680]   burning 2 million each year, cut half
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.440]   the team, put one team with the other.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.480]   And I think you're going to just see
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.800]   some of that portfolio consolidation
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.680]   happen. Go ahead, sex.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:37.040]   I think one way to put it is that we've
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.800]   had a regime change. Those are the words
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.160]   that we've been using for a while. And
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.480]   specifically, we've gone from a regime
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.480]   of capital abundance to a regime of
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.960]   capital scarcity. And I think a lot of
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.320]   people are holding out hope that there's
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.560]   gonna be a quick bounce back. Because
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.920]   we'd cut these interest rates and
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.080]   capital would start flowing again, in a
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.520]   big way. And I think that the Fed here
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.320]   has dumped a bucket of cold water on the
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.760]   markets basically saying we're not
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.080]   bouncing back to capital abundance
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.920]   anytime soon, we're going to be in this
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.880]   environment of more capital scarcity.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.160]   And that's what I think this founders
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.240]   and VCs I have to take into account is
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.280]   this shift could be permanent, or it
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.560]   could last a while.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.680]   Could last 5-10 years. Sure.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.280]   We're seeing a lot of
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.880]   question I have is just what do you guys
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.160]   think is gonna happen to the consumer?
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.320]   Because I actually think that even
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.080]   though founders in many cases could cut
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.600]   more, and they could have acted faster, I
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.240]   actually think that the b2b economy has
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.480]   kind of taken its licks. I mean, for the
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.880]   last year, we've been in this software
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.960]   recession, companies have been sharpening
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   their pencils, they've been cutting costs
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.640]   and getting more efficient. Yes, you
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.440]   could say maybe they haven't done
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.280]   enough, but the consumer has still been
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.280]   strong. But what is the consumer going to
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.680]   do now that credit card rates and
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.520]   interest payments are at all time highs,
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.360]   they're going to cancel their house?
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.560]   No, here's what they're gonna do.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.400]   They're gonna skip an iPhone cycle,
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.960]   instead of going from, you know, 13 to
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.200]   14 or 14 to 15, they're gonna go 13 to
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.480]   1614 to 17. They'll just skip which I did
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.640]   for the first time. I don't need to skip
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.640]   it. But I was just like, this 13 is good
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.400]   enough. They're gonna skip upgrading
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.000]   their car, you're going to keep your car
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.240]   for an extra two or three years. And if
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.440]   you were thinking about moving your
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.720]   house, you're gonna say, you know what,
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.320]   I'm going to make this house work. We're
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.000]   going to put two of the kids in a room.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.240]   100% right. That's that is that is I
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.320]   think that's very, I think that's very
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.640]   well said. And, and the other side of it
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.960]   is that some of these industries where
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.720]   you have these large ticket purchases
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.360]   that drive consumer consumption, their
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.120]   backs are against the wall, look at the
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.760]   automakers that deals that's that the
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.600]   unions have proposed to the automakers
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.400]   will cause them from, I thought I saw
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.280]   an out and then analysis of Ford, where
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.600]   Ford would go. If you just did a pro
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.960]   forma and went back the last couple
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.800]   years, they would have gone from like,
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.440]   you know, 30 billion of profits to minus
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.000]   17 billion of losses. So that's a $47
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.640]   billion swing in the Ford P&L. The only
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.160]   way they overcome that is with more
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.000]   expensive cars, which Jason to your
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.600]   point means that those cars are not
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.600]   going to get sold. I do think that
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.200]   you're going to just have a little bit
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.560]   of belt tightening in the in the
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.200]   consumer.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.480]   I think this is interesting. I think
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.840]   you're trying to you're right that at
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.640]   the same time that the auto companies
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.720]   are facing what you'd expect to be
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.920]   reduced demand because no one can
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.920]   afford a car payment at these higher
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.160]   interest rates. The unions are going on
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.960]   strike demanding Oh, I think this is
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.200]   existential higher wages. Yeah, for a
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.120]   four day work week. How does this work
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.440]   work week, I think that the the labor
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.720]   deal is an existential risk to the
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.720]   unionized auto industry in America. And
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.280]   I'm not opining on whether this deal
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.800]   should or should not happen. I'm just
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.040]   making an observation if the deal as
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.160]   announced happens and you sensitize
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.440]   Stellantis GM and Ford's P&L to these
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.320]   new terms and then you compare that
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.520]   against non unionized highly automated
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.800]   organizations like Tesla and Rivian.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.240]   It's going to be very difficult for the
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.080]   established auto industry to survive.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.400]   Right. And then if you'd layer on top of
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.840]   it, seven, eight, 9% consumer lending
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.560]   rates for new cars, forget about it. And
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.440]   yet the Fed forecast at the same meaning
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.680]   they were being hawkish about rates.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.000]   They also said that they were expecting
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.560]   unemployment next year to be 4.1% down
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.800]   from their previous expectation of 4.5%.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.880]   And they forecast that economic growth
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.720]   would be higher. So I just don't
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.320]   understand how these countervailing
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.040]   forces aren't going to create so much
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.400]   stress in the economy that something
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.640]   breaks. And these idiot unions, honestly,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.240]   their timing is so dumb, whether it's
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.480]   the ones you know, in Hollywood, or this
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.520]   car strike while they're shutting down
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.120]   it's great for Tesla. I mean, it's
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.280]   giving Tesla the entire US auto market.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.760]   Yeah, Tesla is lowering the price when I
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.400]   bought my Model Y long range, I think I
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.360]   paid 72 for it. The old price on this
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.240]   chart says 66. That car is now 53. That's
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.520]   down 20% of 13,000. I'll say the Model Y
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.040]   long range, I think is the greatest
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.640]   vehicle ever made. I paid 57. I think for
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.520]   my Model Y long range. Oh, no, no, I
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.840]   think I'm sorry, I paid 57. I paid this
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.480]   price for the Model Y performance. The
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.280]   best car and yeah, that'll be a $40,000
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.400]   car in the next three years.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.320]   Well, you know, and I looked at it and I
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.400]   speaking of austerity measures, I was
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.960]   like, I have a Model X, do I get another
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.160]   Model X, I think I'll just go with the
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.200]   Model Y. Because the Model X is 50% more
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.560]   and I just prefer the model.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.240]   I think I think this labor deal is going
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.160]   to put tremendous pressure on these
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.080]   established auto OEMs.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.240]   China is now the world's largest
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.520]   exporter from what I understand that
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.080]   just happened. They work I looked it up
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.360]   58 to 64 hours a week factory workers.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.320]   The US factory workers want to work 32
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.840]   hours a week, they want a four day work
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.240]   week. I mean, I don't understand the
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.000]   timing of these unions. I mean, they're
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.760]   just going to move these factories to
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.880]   Mexico or
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.800]   I think it's reasonable for the unions
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.880]   to ask for as much as possible on behalf
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.400]   of their members. That's like, obvious and
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.760]   good because meaning if you're
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.520]   collecting fees from those folks, and
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.440]   you're doing a good job on their behalf,
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.600]   your job is to ask for as much as
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.000]   possible. I get that.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.240]   Where I see the breakdown is that it
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.840]   just doesn't seem like there's enough
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.880]   numeracy between them and the companies
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.720]   that they're negotiating against to
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.080]   really sit down and look at what the
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.960]   impact of this is because you may get a
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.280]   short term labor deal that you can
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.000]   celebrate. But it may actually destroy
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.520]   that union members pension.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.360]   Yes, it may destroy the company.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.520]   And this is my concern is that then that
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.600]   has to get bailed out by by the US
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.320]   taxpayer. And once it happens in one
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.320]   industry, it's going to be very difficult
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.920]   to actually not do it in other
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.720]   industries. And the thing that needs to
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.960]   be understood is the risk that it puts on
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.120]   those kinds of tail outcomes. And I think
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.920]   that that's not well discussed. Nobody in
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.280]   the media is really talking about it.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.040]   They make it a moral issue of like, what
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.320]   is the CEO pay versus what is the ratio
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.960]   of the CEO? And yeah, sure. That's an
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.440]   important issue at some level. But if you
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.360]   if for example, like you have US senators
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.360]   blathering on about how they'll wear a
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.760]   suit not look like a homeless bum. If
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.200]   this deal happens in that and it's like,
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.320]   well, that's not what you should be
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.160]   saying. What you should be saying is, my
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.160]   team has done a financial analysis. And
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.240]   here's what it shows. Right? They're not
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.760]   saying that this is crazy.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.040]   What you're saying is that the
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.520]   negotiation and also the political
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.000]   dimension of this have become
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.600]   completely untethered from economic
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.160]   realities.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.120]   Yes, they are negotiating in the review
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.720]   mirror, they basically talked about
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.640]   whatever billions of dollars in profits
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.160]   the companies previously had during the
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.720]   ZURP environment during the heyday. And
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.800]   yeah, it's just timings off,
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.160]   just added to the list of latent
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:54.000]   problems in this economy. It just feels
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.360]   to me like something is about to break.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.200]   But who knows?
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.600]   I mean, if the zero point sacks you, you
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.960]   keep bringing up like what happens with
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.040]   the consumer, I think they just slow
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.800]   their role, you know, staycation,
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.320]   instead of your
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.600]   number, Larry Summer said at the summit,
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.920]   he said that soft landings are like
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.480]   second marriages, the triumph of hope
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.200]   over experience. Yes, meaning everyone's
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.640]   talking about a soft landing, everyone's
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.480]   banking on a soft landing. But soft
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.160]   landings are actually exceedingly rare.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.680]   When you have very fast rate tightening
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.840]   cycles, it generally has a very
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.200]   predictable effect on the economy.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.200]   There's a lag, but the effect is very
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.960]   predictable, which is a causes recessions.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.360]   And then I would already been in a
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.440]   b2b to recession, we're starting to come
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.960]   out of that. But I think the consumer
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.560]   hasn't been hit yet. And maybe that has
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.880]   to do with all the stimulus they push
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.200]   through. Yeah. And that created some
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:45.920]   amount of
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.680]   cushion for the consumer. But I just
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.600]   wonder if that cushions run out now,
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.080]   we're about to enter a new phase.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.520]   And it would what all of these
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.160]   strikes you if you overplay your hand
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.800]   Chamath is automation. So this happened
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.800]   in New York, just over 10 years ago, the
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.960]   fast food workers wanted, you know, I
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.040]   think it was 1520 bucks an hour. Okay,
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.480]   seems reasonable. And they replaced
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.720]   every cashier, you go to McDonald's. Now
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.400]   you're ordering on the app, or you're
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   ordering on a kiosk in space. And we
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.960]   have an investment in a company called
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:21.200]   Hello meter. But this company does is
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.800]   pretty simple. They just study what's
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:25.600]   going on inside fast restaurants. And
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.320]   then they just increase the speed at
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.400]   which people are getting served. And
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.200]   they're crushing it. Why? People can't
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.320]   hire people. There's not enough
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.920]   immigrants in the country anymore. We
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.000]   have an anti immigration thing going on
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.040]   here. So unemployment is too low. And the
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.280]   the salaries are too high. It's not
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.880]   working. A lot of restaurants are
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.760]   breaking because a 30 or $40 dishwasher
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.200]   is the difference between a company, you
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.040]   know, a restaurant being profitable or
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.480]   not. All right, listen, there's
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.240]   apparently some potential major
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.400]   breakthrough in autoimmune disease
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:00.000]   treatment with this new inverse vaccine.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.400]   Let's go to our science correspondence.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.720]   The Sultan of science himself for
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.360]   science corner.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.280]   The taxes turns his camera.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:15.200]   Wow. He's going to take a dump. He'll be
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.920]   back. He's back. I'm here. I'm here. Jeez,
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.120]   you wouldn't even let me get away with
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.400]   that. We were zoom shaming you do not
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.720]   leave. You can learn something.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:33.280]   Saks. My super got I just had my super
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.760]   got chocolate. Oh, so good. I just got my
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.920]   super gut protein and the weight loss
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:42.240]   continues. Health. My gut so good.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.560]   There was a paper published in the
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.080]   journal nature this week, which I
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080]   thought was worth highlighting sex,
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.000]   you're going to be quizzed afterwards on
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.880]   exactly what I say during this, this and
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.640]   the implications for it. We've all heard
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.080]   of and know folks that have
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.160]   autoimmune conditions and some of us may
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   suffer from them. An autoimmune
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.680]   condition is when our immune system
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.720]   mounts an attack against a protein that
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.800]   exists in our body that is natively part
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.480]   of our body, our immune system kind of
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.400]   mistakes that protein for being a foreign
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.960]   antigen. So the term antigen refers to
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.440]   proteins that the immune system views as
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.640]   invading and it needs to go in and
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.320]   attack. So when the immune system messes
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.040]   up, and it sees a protein in our body as
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.480]   being a foreign antigen and starts
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.920]   attacking it, you get these autoimmune
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.920]   conditions and autoimmune conditions
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.520]   as you know, are very debilitating
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.920]   cost on the health system on people's
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.760]   lives. The top 10 autoimmune diseases
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.320]   is like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.800]   even type one diabetes, multiple
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.120]   sclerosis, irritable bowel, show
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:40.880]   grins, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, these
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.680]   are all pretty in different ways
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.960]   damaging diseases. So this team at
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.360]   University of Chicago in 2019 published
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.840]   a paper where they actually took an
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.280]   antigen and glycosylated it. So
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.960]   basically attached some sugar molecules
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.320]   and carbohydrate molecules to it
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.200]   and presented it in the liver. So they
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.720]   put it into the blood and it showed up
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.960]   in the liver. And they were able to
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.280]   cause type one diabetes to not develop
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.720]   in an animal model that was supposed to
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.400]   get type one diabetes. So they did an
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.080]   extension of that work and the team has
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.760]   gotten broader and they just published
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.640]   this week, a much more substantive paper
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.040]   that highlights a pretty incredible
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.000]   technique that may potentially address
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.640]   a long list of autoimmune conditions.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.120]   So they take the antigen, the protein
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.000]   that is using sorry, in the type one
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.360]   example, are you saying like the beta
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.200]   cells didn't get destroyed? Like it
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.040]   just stopped? It just stopped everything
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.120]   on the time. Yeah. So the immune system
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.600]   has a bunch of ways for self regulating.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.440]   There are T cells in our body called T
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.920]   reg cells or regulatory T cells. Their
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.480]   job is to go find the T cells and the
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.640]   antibodies that are attacking our own
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.560]   protein. That's their job. And when they
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.880]   don't do their job, the antibodies and
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.440]   the T cells go and attack our own body.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.040]   So T reg cells kind of when they're
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.560]   turned off, they're not doing their job.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.280]   So it turns out that when a protein is
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.960]   presented in the liver in this this
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.520]   particular part of the liver, the immune
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.720]   system recognizes that protein as being a
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.120]   safe protein. And there's a regulatory
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.960]   process that gets kicked off that causes
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.200]   the immune system to start to see that
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.360]   protein as being safe, it should not be
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.600]   attacked. And T reg cells start to
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.360]   develop and other systems start to
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.640]   develop that tell the whole immune
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.520]   system, stop attacking this protein. This
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.680]   is a safe protein. This is our body.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.400]   This is like friendly fire, right? Like
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.240]   do not like friendly fire, do not attack
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.480]   this protein. So what they did is they
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.680]   took several antigens, proteins, and
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.520]   glycosylated them, meaning they put some,
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.360]   you know, molecules on them, put them in
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.920]   the in the blood just with an IV hook up,
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.440]   they go into the liver. And once they're
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.880]   in the liver, the immune system sees them
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   and is like, Whoa, these are totally safe
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.520]   now. And they found by analyzing all the
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.760]   different T cells, the regulatory pathway
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.920]   that emerged that caused the body to
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.080]   stop attacking that protein. And they
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.080]   were able to end Ms using this induced
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.920]   system in animals. So basically, we have
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:10.320]   a known model for making multiple
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.720]   sclerosis show up in animals. And they
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.360]   were able to stop Ms in the animals by
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.880]   taking this particular protein that they
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.480]   use for Ms and they put it in the in the
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.760]   liver. IV, they did the same with an egg
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.040]   allergy. And they did the same with
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.120]   several other antigens. This represents
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.360]   a very novel and seemingly super
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.680]   impactful and powerful way to think
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.680]   about eliminating autoimmune disease
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.760]   going forward is that we can take the
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.400]   antigen and we now know the antigen or
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.160]   the protein that causes almost all of
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.680]   these autoimmune conditions from
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.520]   thyroiditis to lupus to RA to Ms. And we
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.520]   can take that protein glycosylated, put
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.760]   it in an IV ends up in our liver gets
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.680]   presented and our immune system realizes
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.360]   I shouldn't be attacking this anymore
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.160]   and resolves it. So it opens up a whole
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.520]   new category of therapeutic pathways for
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.360]   addressing all autoimmune conditions.
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.920]   It's a totally new modality. It's a very
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.280]   interesting approach. It'll be studied
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.080]   more deeply. Folks will take this paper
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.600]   and try and start to develop very
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.480]   specific therapeutics for very specific
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.760]   autoimmune conditions using this
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.360]   approach. And hopefully over the next
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.640]   couple of years, we see some of these
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.800]   things have success gain traction and go
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:19.360]   to market.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.440]   These autoimmune diseases are typically
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.200]   some combination of genetic and
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.680]   environmental. So this is not attacking
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.680]   them on that basis. It's attacking them
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.880]   in a different modality.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.920]   You know, there's two ways that we
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.760]   address autoimmune conditions today. The
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.480]   first one is by presenting the antigen
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.640]   to the immune system before you develop
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.760]   autoimmunity. This is like, you know,
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.040]   when they give little bits of peanuts to
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.280]   kids, and that's how you present prevent
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.040]   peanut allergies. In most autoimmune
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.040]   conditions, we're past that point, the
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.440]   immune system has already developed T
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.800]   cells and antibodies to go and attack.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.720]   So that doesn't work. The second way is
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.320]   immune suppression. And that's terrible.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.640]   Globally suppressing meaning on the
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.640]   whole body turning off the immune system
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.000]   is not healthy in a lot of ways. And
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.840]   that's the current, you know, kind of
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.360]   best in class way to address autoimmune
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.120]   conditions. So this is a new approach,
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.760]   which is we can actually re regulate the
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.080]   immune system to not attack itself to
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.840]   not attack our own proteins by
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:12.000]   introducing that protein with a with
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   what's called glycosylation, getting it
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.760]   into the liver, and boom, this magic
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.880]   starts to happen. And we'll see what the
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.480]   side effects are as they start to try
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.720]   this on humans, we see, we'll see what
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:23.920]   conditions are more effective than
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.840]   others. Sorry for the stupid basic
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.800]   question. But how is the how is it
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.160]   different when we put these into say,
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.080]   like, you said these were monkeys or
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.320]   chimpanzees? So how are their anuses
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.360]   different than your anus?
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:39.920]   What? Sorry. Anyway, let's keep going
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.280]   here. Great science corner.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.400]   I'm laughing at how contorted that
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.800]   you go you punch it up. You and I do
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.880]   these workshops. I'm just chopping.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.600]   Yeah, we work on work on punching it
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.960]   up. We'll try to get a better you're in
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.520]   show. Anyway, it's super cool. autoimmune
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.720]   conditions, new worlds getting better.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.600]   The term refers to refers to an approach
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   to a therapeutic and this modality is a
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.080]   new modality. So it's a super exciting
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.640]   new kind of universe to be explored now
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.840]   on how we might be able to treat
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.120]   autoimmune conditions ranging from
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.560]   let me okay let me try hold on.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:12.880]   Yeah, good.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.520]   Freeberg.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.280]   Hey, Saks you're lost on the science
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:15.520]   one.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.600]   Freeberg what part of the body do you
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.520]   think is going to be most impacted by
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:20.240]   these discoveries?
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.520]   No. The immune system.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.360]   No, no, no, that's not good. Okay.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.480]   Come on. Let me try. Let me try.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.480]   You guys are just so dumb about science.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.360]   Okay. All right, here we go. Okay,
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.040]   here we go. Freeberg I thought the only
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.080]   solution to Ms was fecal
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.480]   transplantation through Uranus.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.760]   Yeah. Okay, there we go. There's your
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.360]   winner. There's your way. Good.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.680]   Legal transfer, because you kind of did
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.000]   a little misdirection there with the
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.600]   fecal transplant. And then we came
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.160]   through Uranus. That would be the way to
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.080]   to get that done. We're going to wrap
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.400]   here. Thanks to everybody who came.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.160]   Brian Armstrong also did a great job.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.560]   Elon did a great job. Thanks to
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.000]   everybody who showed up for us. And if
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.840]   you want to watch all the talks, all the
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.320]   talks are being released exclusively on

[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.040]   the all in podcast, Twitter handle, and
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.640]   type all in podcast on YouTube and you
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.040]   get to see all these talks available now
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.080]   and Ray from the unofficial all in
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.000]   podcast meetups is doing 150th meetup
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.440]   for the fans in all different cities
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.800]   around the world. So just do a Google
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.720]   search for that for the Sultan of
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.280]   science and the world's greatest
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.600]   conference producer, the dictator in the
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.440]   arena, making it happen. And for when it
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:41.280]   paltrums favorite bestie, David Sachs,
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.720]   I'm the most generous moderator. See you
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.880]   next time. Bye bye.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.680]   Let your winners ride.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.000]   Rain man David Sachs.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.760]   And it said we open source it to the
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.080]   fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:04.880]   Love you. Queen of Kinhwa.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.520]   Besties are gone.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.200]   That's my dog taking a notice in your
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.560]   driveway.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.880]   Oh man. My avatar will meet me at
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.400]   Winston. We should all just get a room
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.160]   and just have one big huge orgy because
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.680]   they're all just useless. It's like this
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.280]   like sexual tension that they just need
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.360]   to release somehow.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.720]   What are the beat? What are the beat?
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.320]   We need to get merch.
