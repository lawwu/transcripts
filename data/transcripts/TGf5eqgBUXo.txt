[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380]   All right, I want to do a news reaction here.
[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.880]   Brief.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.180]   It's an article that a Canadian listener of the show sent me.
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.800]   And I thought it had something positive in it about our, what we can do and what we
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.580]   are doing about some of the travails of social media and our culture.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.800]   So here's the article right here.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.040]   Uh, it's written by Sierra add growl.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.780]   It was a politician in Toronto and the, uh, the title of this article is Sierra
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.580]   aggro explains why she's embracing tech, but not Twitter in her run for public.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.440]   Office.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.080]   So there's a couple of things I wanted to point out.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.980]   And for those who are listening, the YouTube version of this segment actually
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.080]   will show you the article as I go through it.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.080]   All right.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.680]   So a couple of things I want to point out here, here's where the first
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.820]   big point is of the article.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.380]   She says last week, I announced that I'm running for Toronto city
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.760]   council, the Parkdale high park.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.340]   So this is someone who is running for city council in a major city.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.500]   And this was the big part of the announcement.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.960]   And I'm quoting from the article here, but as a candidate and a counselor, so if
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.160]   elected, I will not be using Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, I deactivated
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.680]   my accounts this morning.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.480]   This is something that is very rare to see a political candidate announcing.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.540]   I will not use social media during my campaign.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.100]   I will not use social media once I'm elected.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.060]   All right.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.020]   So Sarah gives two main reasons why she dislikes these services.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.600]   Let me just briefly summarize both number one, and I'm quoting here.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.980]   It is well-documented that social media has subjected people to intense
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.500]   vitriol and abuse with the highest levels of harassment and threats directed
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.860]   towards women, LGBTQ2 plus those who aren't white and people at all the
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.800]   intersection of these identities.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.060]   All right.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.900]   So vitriol and abuse.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.940]   Number two.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.460]   And again, I'm quoting is these platforms contribute to much wider harm, including
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.600]   radicalization, polarization, deteriorating mental health, the undermining
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.220]   of democratic beliefs and institutions.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.380]   All right.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.800]   So those are two clear issues we've talked about before.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.460]   These are harassment machines and they are causing all these negative
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.980]   psychological impacts, even beyond harassment.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.360]   All right.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.420]   So what do we have so far?
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.160]   A politician saying, I'm not going to use social media and giving two well-known,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.180]   but very strong reasons for why not.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.500]   All right.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.180]   Now we get to the part that gave me hope.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.360]   I think this is very interesting.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.720]   She says, this does not mean I'm not using technology.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.600]   She goes on to talk about all the ways she will be using
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.160]   technology to connect with people.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.000]   So they built out this fancy website.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.200]   And I'm quoting here that will make it easy for people to share information
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   with their friends and neighbors on whatever platform they like.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.720]   And I hope you will share this article too.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.600]   I'll be engaging directly both online and off through the site, email, text,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.180]   newsletter, virtual calls, face-to-face interactions, and events where we can
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.100]   actually talk to each other and not just tweet at each other.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.540]   This is the thing that I like.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.060]   Sierra Agrell is making the observation that is true, but that is often missed
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.860]   in media discussions about social media and its ills, that social media
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.900]   does not equal the internet to say.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.660]   I'm not going to use social media is not the same as saying I am not going to use
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.740]   the modern internet to connect with people, to hear from my constituents,
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.900]   to hear what their issues are, to know what's going on.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.740]   She is saying these tools are not the only way to do that.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.540]   And in fact, there are pretty bad way to do that.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.780]   I have all of these other existing tools, my website, email, text, newsletter,
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.700]   virtual calls, face-to-face interactions, and events.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.260]   This I think is one of the most important moves we can make to get around some of
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.740]   the ills of social media, and that is to move away from the platforms, but then
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.460]   not just move away from the platforms, but to declare with confidence and
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.460]   embrace with confidence, digital alternatives, the internet was around
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.660]   before social media, the internet will be around after social media.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.100]   There's plenty of innovation out there.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.540]   There's plenty of novel tools out there where the internet can help you, the
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.060]   democratic process and connection.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.460]   So I like this.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.340]   You can walk away from social media without walking away from technology.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.260]   Sierra concludes by saying, I want to use technology, but in a way that builds
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.700]   connections and allows people to understand what I'm trying to do and why.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.140]   All right.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.860]   So there we go.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.580]   There is some positive vision of our future with social media.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.860]   We can embrace technology without having to be clicking on those stupid icons and
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.420]   doing those little 240 character threads and emojis grown grown adults using emojis.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.340]   Uh, this politician has it right.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.180]   And I hope other people follow suit.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.100]   That was a good article.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.180]   I should mention, if you want to send me things interesting at Cal Newport.com,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.340]   that's where I got this particular article.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.260]   I do like the links that people send me.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.500]   Uh, if you have thoughts about the show, send those to Jesse at Cal Newport.com.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.860]   He actually reads them.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.940]   Are they right?
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.860]   Do we get, do we get comments?
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.620]   Yeah, we do.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.700]   Some good ones.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.180]   [MUSIC]
