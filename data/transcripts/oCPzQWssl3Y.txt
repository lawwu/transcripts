[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540]   Well, do we need to hear from God before we make a decision?
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.180]   And what if we have a friend who claims to have heard God's voice on something, but
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.780]   we think they're mistaken in that decision?
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.060]   How do we question that decision without undermining their faith?
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.420]   This is a really sharp question from a listener named Matt.
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.660]   Pastor John, thank you for your ministry and all that you do for the glory of God through
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.660]   the world.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.140]   I have a question about addressing issues with people who have prayed about a certain
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.700]   decision and feel that God spoke to them.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.380]   Is there a way to lovingly push back when it seems like what they apparently heard from
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.900]   God seems like a poor choice?
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.280]   How do you critique their choice without shaking their faith and making them doubt their ability
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.620]   to ever hear from God?
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.540]   Well, I would attempt five steps with them, perhaps.
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.540]   And this may be over time rather than in the moment.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.360]   These are things you need to establish with a person in order to help them see rightly
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.560]   about this.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.660]   So the first thing I want to establish is that Scripture trumps spiritual gifts.
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.820]   And the principle is found in 1 Corinthians 14, 37, and 38, where Paul says this, "If
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.580]   anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.140]   writing to you are a command of the Lord.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.580]   If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.340]   Now remember, he's saying that to prophets, "If anyone thinks he's a prophet."
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.540]   So this is a person who claims because he's spiritual or because he has a close tie-in
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.580]   with God and a spiritual gift, he has a word from God about something he should do or say.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.520]   And Paul is saying, "Now wait a minute.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.700]   If I say something that preempts what you just said, you need to submit to what I say
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.860]   because I'm writing Scripture as an authorized apostle."
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.300]   Now, the implication of that for us is we have the New Testament as the apostolic deposit,
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.580]   and that therefore today is the criterion for assessing whether someone has discerned
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.060]   truly the will of God.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.540]   And if you perceive that a person is about to do something because they think they have
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.060]   a hotline to heaven or a word of prophecy or word of knowledge or some kind of dream
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.580]   or vision, and yet it is unwise on Scriptural grounds, then on this principle you can ask
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.540]   them to reconsider, not because you don't think God can speak today but because you
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.460]   have been told by God how to discern what is true and wise and what's not.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.140]   Number two, the normal Christian pattern of discerning God's will is by a transformed
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.420]   mind that assesses things with the instincts of God by the Spirit through the Word.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.980]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.280]   Romans 12, 1 and 2, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the mercies of God to present your bodies
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.700]   a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.860]   Do not be conformed to this world but be—" here it comes—"be transformed by the renewing
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.460]   of your mind."
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.460]   Why?
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:41.980]   "So that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.980]   and perfect."
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.280]   So I'm arguing that there is, in verse 2 of Romans 12, an implicit normative pattern
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.180]   for discerning the will of God, and that implicit normative pattern is "be transformed in
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.140]   the renewing of your mind."
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.960]   And you can study out how that happens by the Spirit through the Word in the writings
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:15.360]   of Paul, but that's different than a sudden breaking in of a Word from outside.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.580]   So I would try to encourage somebody to develop this as their normal pattern of discernment.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.480]   And here it is again in Philippians 1, 9 to 11, Paul's prayer, "It is my prayer that
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.320]   your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment."
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920]   Now why would you want your love to abound with knowledge and all discernment?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.520]   "So that," verse 10, "you may approve."
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.400]   That's the same word as back in Romans 12, "approve what is excellent."
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.120]   So how do you know what the excellent path is?
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.860]   There's a fork in the road, and one path is to be chosen over the other.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.240]   How do you discern the excellent path?
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.040]   "That you may discern what is excellent and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.520]   filled with fruits of righteousness."
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   That's what we want.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.840]   We want our lives to have been marked by making righteous choices and bearing righteous fruit.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.760]   And this text says it comes by your love being supplemented with or informed by knowledge
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.880]   and discernment so that you can test and approve what is excellent out there.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.680]   So both of those texts, Romans 12 and Philippians 1, set a normal pattern of discerning the
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.760]   will of God by a transformed mind and a love informed by knowledge and discernment, rather
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.620]   than ordinarily receiving special words from God.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.760]   Number three, the spiritual gift of prophecy, as the typical means by which one might receive
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.040]   a special word from God, the typical gift, the gift of prophecy, is fallible.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   If somebody thinks that the gift of prophecy results in people going around today speaking
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.960]   Scripture, adding to the Bible, they're going to bring down the wrath of God on them.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.280]   First Thessalonians 5:20 says, "Don't despise prophecies."
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.960]   So I don't want to deny that there's such a gift as prophecy today.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.440]   You can go to the Desiring God website and see the series of articles that John Bloom
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.720]   did a while back on the nature of biblical prophecy today, which I think are good.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.560]   Do not despise prophecies.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   Test everything.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.440]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.280]   I think that implies that the gift of prophecy should be weighed, discerned, not assumed
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.660]   to be Scripture-level infallible truth.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:53.020]   And so you have a warrant then, a biblical warrant, for saying to your friend, "Remember,
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.780]   biblical gifts of prophecy and wisdom and knowledge coming through a fallible human
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.840]   mind, like yours and mine, is fallible.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.380]   It must be tested by Scripture."
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:12.940]   Number four, Matt asks, "How do you critique their choice without shaking their faith and
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.500]   making them doubt their ability to ever hear from God?"
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:25.020]   And I would say that you encourage them to see, to feel, and to believe that it's a hundred
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:34.340]   times more precious and wonderful that we have a book like the Bible where we can count
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.740]   on every line of it properly understood being infallible.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:47.140]   It's amazing that we have such a large, glorious revelation from God.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:54.500]   And you suggest to them then that it's more likely that they will have a reliable gift
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:02.900]   of prophecy, a reliable gift of wisdom or word of knowledge, if they are submitted to
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:09.860]   the Scriptures and saturated with the Scriptures, because the Holy Spirit is always consistent.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.500]   If you are immersed in the word of the Scripture, the word of the Spirit, it is much more likely
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.860]   that you will be able to discern the voice of the Spirit if he's leading you in some
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:30.580]   other way that will always be finally tested by the one infallible source we have, namely
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.260]   the Scripture.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:40.020]   And the last thing, number five, that you might do or say is remind your friend that
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:46.860]   what God cares about most when it comes to doing his will—if a person is struggling
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:57.180]   with how do you find the will of God—what God values most is our holiness in every decision
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:04.540]   rather than whether the decision itself, like who do you marry or what house to buy or where
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:10.900]   to live or what job to take or whether to buy this shirt or that shirt.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:19.420]   In every decision, if you are acting in a biblical, holy way, God is pleased.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:26.300]   First Thessalonians 4:3, "This is the will of God, your sanctification."
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.420]   That's a wonderfully liberating thing.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:35.980]   So those are the five strategies in the bigger picture that I would have to try to help a
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:43.860]   friend not elevate a word from outside the Bible about a decision which you, judging
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.020]   by the Bible, regard as a poor decision.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.980]   Wow, that's a lot to ponder here, Pastor John, especially that idea that what God values
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.420]   most is our holiness in every decision rather than in the precise decision itself.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.820]   That is really sharp insight worth a lot more consideration.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.820]   Thank you.
