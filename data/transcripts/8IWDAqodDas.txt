[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.140]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.920]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.040]   Today, we are talking about time perception.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.920]   Our perception of time is perhaps the most important factor
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.040]   in how we gauge our life.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.960]   That is, whether or not we think we are being successful,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.500]   whether or not we are failing,
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.280]   whether or not we live in fear,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.440]   whether or not we live in relation to things
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.680]   in a way that's positive.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.040]   And the reason for that is that our perception of time
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.840]   is directly linked to the neurochemical states
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.040]   that control mood, stress, happiness, excitement,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.080]   and of course, it frames the way
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.680]   in which we evaluate our past.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   So whether or not we think of our past
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   as successful or unsuccessful, it frames our present,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.380]   whether or not we think we are on track or off track,
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.840]   and it frames our sense of the future,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.480]   whether or not we think we have a bright future,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.520]   a dim future, or whether or not the future
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.240]   is very uncertain or not.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.260]   Today, we're going to talk about
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260]   the science of time perception,
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.200]   and we are going to talk about tools and protocols
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000]   that you can use that can enhance your ability
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.020]   to dilate and contract time.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.920]   What do we mean by dilate and contract time?
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.460]   We can control the speed at which we experience life.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.140]   We can slow things down or we can speed
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.880]   our experience of life up,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.960]   and we can do that in a very direct and dynamic way.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.440]   It's actually not that hard
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   once you understand how time perception works.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.520]   So that's where we're headed.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.680]   I think you're going to come away from today's episode
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.800]   with a lot of new knowledge,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.400]   and certainly with many tools that you can try
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.760]   in your daily life, whether or not that's work, sport,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.400]   relational, emotional, and so on.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   Before we begin our discussion about time perception,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.960]   I'd like to answer some questions that I received
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.060]   related to the episode on fasting
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.860]   and time-restricted feeding.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.080]   If you haven't seen that episode,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.840]   this information should still be of use to you.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.000]   Time-restricted feeding involves eating
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.120]   for a particular period of time in each 24-hour cycle
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.700]   that's fairly regular.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180]   So this would be an eight-hour most often
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.260]   or a 10-hour block.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.940]   Some people do shorter feeding windows,
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.040]   but regardless, that feeding window is supposed to fall
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.800]   at more or less the same period within each 24-hour day.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   This has a number of positive effects on gene expression
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.480]   that regulate a number of positive effects
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.000]   on the different tissues of the body.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.840]   And for some people, not all,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.920]   but for some people makes weight loss easier
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.040]   because of the way that they are not eating
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.800]   for large periods of each 24-hour cycle.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.460]   In any event, one of the major questions I got
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.000]   after that episode was do supplements break a fast?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.740]   And during that episode, I talked about what breaks a fast
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.260]   is highly contextual.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.560]   It basically boils down to whether or not
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.540]   something you ingest, whether it be liquid or food,
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.460]   increases your resting blood glucose,
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.980]   how much it increases that resting blood glucose,
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.760]   and how long that increase lasts.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.960]   So you can check out the episode
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.460]   for more about what breaks a fast,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.200]   but to address this issue about supplements
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.920]   and whether or not supplements a particular break of fast,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.560]   many of the questions were about Athletic Greens.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.480]   Athletic Greens is a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.040]   It is also a terrific supplement that I had been taking
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.960]   for more than a decade before this podcast launched,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.320]   and many people have been using
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.840]   and continue to use Athletic Greens.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.920]   Does Athletic Greens break a fast?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.040]   Well, that will somewhat depend on whether or not
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.240]   your resting blood glucose tends to run high or low,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.120]   but for most people, including me, because I've measured it,
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.580]   ingesting Athletic Greens does not break a fast,
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.180]   and if it happens to break a fast,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.800]   it would be a very transient break in fast.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.560]   So without knowing your resting blood glucose levels
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040]   on an individual basis, there's no way I can say for sure
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.880]   that it doesn't break a fast, but chances are it does not,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.360]   because it doesn't contain much carbohydrate or sugar,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.680]   and it doesn't tend to therefore pull you
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.560]   out of the molecular milieu
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.240]   associated with low blood glucose states.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.960]   The other question I get is whether or not
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.780]   things like fish oil break a fast,
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.960]   and once again, this will be contextual,
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.880]   but because fish oil is a fat,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.180]   mainly essential fatty acids, in particular EPA and DHA,
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.900]   those don't tend to raise blood glucose very much.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.000]   In my case, having measured using
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.920]   a continuous glucose monitor, my resting blood glucose,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.700]   fish oil does not in any way change
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640]   my resting blood glucose.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.140]   Chances are it won't do that for most people as well.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.840]   So does fish oil break a fast?
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.200]   Chances are it does not.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.840]   And of course, people wanted to know
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   about pill type supplements, you know,
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.960]   caffeine and things that raise dopamine
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.220]   and their vitamins and minerals, in general,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.220]   if something doesn't contain sugar
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.280]   or much carbohydrate of any kind,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.500]   it's not going to raise blood glucose very much.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.480]   Now, of course, protein can raise blood glucose
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.240]   and fat can too as well, although to a lesser extent.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.000]   So again, this is all contextual,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.100]   but at least by the logic that I just spelled out,
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.780]   athletic greens, fish oil, and most forms of supplements,
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.700]   provided they don't have any sugar or protein content,
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.720]   should not quote unquote break a fast.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.520]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.760]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.540]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.800]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.000]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.840]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.920]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.000]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.640]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.040]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   And one of the key things about our visual system
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   is that it's designed so that when you move into areas
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.640]   where it's sunny or where there are shadows,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.820]   you can still see things with crystal clarity.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.980]   Many sunglasses out there have the problem
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.640]   that you have to keep taking them off
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.160]   and putting them back on depending on the overall
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.460]   so-called ambient environment that you're in.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.540]   Roca sunglasses have solved this problem.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.840]   And their eyeglasses also have superb clarity
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.520]   regardless of overall ambient lighting, as we say.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.320]   In other words, you see everything very clearly
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.460]   no matter where you are.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.200]   They also come in a number of different styles.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.560]   The aesthetics are really terrific.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.640]   So unlike a lot of performance glasses out there
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.320]   that make people look like cyborgs,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.160]   you can wear them anywhere.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.040]   You can wear them to dinner,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.300]   you can wear them to school or work or in social engagements,
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.800]   and you can wear them running and cycling
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.140]   and out doing your various activities.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.560]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.280]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.260]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.460]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.120]   probiotic drink.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.140]   I started using Athletic Greens way back in 2012,
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.780]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.700]   The reason I started using Athletic Greens
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.220]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.860]   once or twice every day is that it covers
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.980]   all of my foundational needs for vitamins,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.780]   minerals, and probiotics.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.060]   In fact, when people ask me what supplements
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.260]   they should take, if I were going to recommend
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.340]   just one supplement, it would be Athletic Greens
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.640]   because of the enormous number of biological factors
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.740]   that it impacts in a positive way.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.580]   As I mentioned, vitamins and minerals,
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.000]   the probiotics are really important
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.180]   for the gut microbiome and gut health,
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.380]   which is important for the immune system
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.200]   and for brain health and for mood
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.100]   and a number of other important factors,
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.920]   including hormones and so on.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.380]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.300]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.820]   to claim their special offer.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.480]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.440]   which make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.220]   while you're on the road or in the car,
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.760]   and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.480]   Vitamin D3 and K2 have been shown to be really important
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.960]   for a number of important aspects
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.580]   of your immediate and long-term health,
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.560]   including blood lipid profiles and a number of other things.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.400]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.560]   to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.600]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.360]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.800]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.160]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.740]   to help you better understand your body
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.840]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.300]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.800]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.620]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.280]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.020]   And it's for that reason that I get my blood work done
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.860]   once every four to six months.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.440]   Might seem like a lot, but it has been vital
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.900]   in order to keep my health where I want it
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.780]   and to ensure that my health trajectory
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.020]   is heading in the direction that I'd like it to go
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.900]   with each passing year.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.780]   The other thing about Inside Tracker is they have DNA tests
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.720]   which can tell you about the specific makeup of your genes
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.100]   that can impact your particular nutrition, lifestyle,
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.380]   and supplementation regimes that can also help you
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.260]   steer your immediate and long-term health
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.280]   in the direction that you want to go.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.520]   They make the whole thing very, very easy.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.160]   You can have the blood test taken at home,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.960]   or you can go to a local clinic.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.780]   Then the results come back.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.320]   And the wonderful thing is the platform,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.380]   the dashboard that they use, walks you through your data
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.380]   and points to specific things related to nutrition.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.820]   Maybe you should be eating more of certain things,
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.300]   eating less of others,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.680]   supplementing in certain ways or not,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.000]   and lifestyle factors like exercise
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.960]   in order to bring the numbers into the ranges
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.520]   that are right for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.980]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.020]   So let's talk about time perception.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.540]   And the most fundamental aspect of time perception
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.700]   is something called entrainment.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.600]   Entrainment is the way in which your internal processes,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.040]   your biology and your psychology,
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.300]   are linked to some external thing.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.420]   And the most basic form of entrainment
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.660]   that we are all a slave to all year round
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660]   for our entire life are so-called circannual rhythms.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.400]   We have neurons, nerve cells in our eye, in our brain,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.240]   and in our body that are marking off the passage of time
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.380]   throughout the year,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.160]   literally a calendar system in your brain and body.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.960]   And the way this works is beautifully simple.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.440]   Light seen by your eyes inhibits,
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.920]   meaning it reduces the amount of a hormone
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.360]   released in your brain called melatonin.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.880]   Melatonin has two major functions.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.140]   One function is to make you sleepy at night,
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.540]   and the other is to regulate
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.700]   some of the other hormones of the body,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.740]   in particular, testosterone and estrogen.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.060]   When we view light,
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.060]   we reduce the amount of melatonin released.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.900]   In fact, if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.000]   when melatonin typically is pretty high
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.180]   in your brain and body,
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.580]   and you flip on a bright light in the bathroom,
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.820]   your melatonin levels crash down to almost zero
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.500]   and stay there.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.820]   Light is a very powerful modulator of melatonin,
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.940]   and light inhibits melatonin.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.020]   Throughout the year, depending on where you live,
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.060]   day length varies, and as a consequence,
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.820]   the amount of light from the sun
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.260]   that is available to you varies.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.580]   So when days are long,
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.760]   the amount of melatonin in your brain and body
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.380]   that's released tends to be less.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.240]   There's less of it,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.340]   and it's released for shorter amounts of time, okay?
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.460]   Because light inhibits melatonin.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.320]   When days are very short,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.400]   the amount of melatonin that's released
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.600]   and the duration that that melatonin exists
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.320]   in your brain and body tends to be much longer.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.780]   So melatonin correlates with day length,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.100]   and if we are viewing more light,
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.580]   we have less melatonin, we view less light,
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.440]   we have more melatonin.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   You see different amounts of light each day,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.880]   but we have a process in our brain and body
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.260]   that averages the amount of light that you're seeing,
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.960]   both from artificial sources and from sunlight,
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.640]   and measures that off.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   And it's so exquisitely precise
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.180]   that for a given, say, eight-hour day in the spring,
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.860]   because spring in the Northern Hemisphere or elsewhere,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.240]   days are getting longer,
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.140]   that means that the amount of melatonin
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.400]   is getting progressively less and less,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.660]   and that signal is conveyed to all the systems
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.060]   of your brain and body.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.860]   And this is why most people, not all,
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.240]   but most people feel like they have more energy
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.860]   in the spring.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.700]   Conversely, when you have an eight-hour day in the winter,
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.860]   the amount of melatonin that corresponds
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.660]   to that eight-hour day
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.460]   is getting progressively greater and greater,
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.460]   because why?
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.580]   Days are getting shorter,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.480]   so melatonin is increasing from day to day to day.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.880]   Every cell and system of your body pays attention to this,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.660]   and as a consequence, most people, not all,
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.940]   but most people feel they have a little less
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.580]   or sometimes a lot less energy
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.480]   and a slightly lower mood in the winter months.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.780]   Now, there are exceptions to this, of course,
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.620]   but the melatonin signal is the way
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.220]   in which your internal state, your mood,
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.340]   your sense of energy, even your appetite,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.180]   is entrained, is matched to some external event.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.980]   In this case, the event is the rotation of the Earth
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.340]   around the sun.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.560]   There are other forms of entrainment,
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.040]   meaning the matching of your brain and body
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.800]   to things that are happening in your external environment.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.820]   One particularly interesting example of this
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.080]   was published last year by Perik et al.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.960]   in "Cell Report," "Cell Press Journal," excellent journal,
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.740]   showing that across the calendar year,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.280]   the amount of testosterone and estrogen
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.740]   that human beings make varies,
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.820]   such that in longer days,
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.280]   they tend to make more testosterone and estrogen
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.420]   than in shorter days,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.800]   and this was correlated with things like
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.740]   desire to seek out romantic partners
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.140]   or have romantic interactions with their existing partners,
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.820]   even aggression, although not violent aggression,
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.980]   but sense of kind of willingness to argue
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.180]   and to get into kind of combative states
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.340]   and overall energy and mood.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.980]   This is something that had been hypothesized
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.820]   for a long time,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.940]   but it had never really been cleanly demonstrated,
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.660]   and what they showed was that it's actually the skin
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.960]   that's taking information about the amount of light
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.940]   and converting it into these increases
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.700]   in testosterone and estrogen.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.500]   Light exposure to the skin turns out about two hours a day.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.380]   This was sunlight in this case to the upper body.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.280]   These people weren't naked.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.980]   They were wearing clothes, but their arms were exposed.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.140]   Their upper back and neck and face were exposed.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.060]   They were not wearing hats.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.840]   Resulted in large increases,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.700]   significant increases in testosterone and estrogen.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.580]   Now, you could probably export a tool from that if you liked.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.260]   That's not really what this podcast is about,
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.680]   but it's very clear that because the skin is acting
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.900]   as an endocrine organ, excuse me,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.120]   as kind of a hormone influencing organ,
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.080]   that getting light on the skin, not just to the eyes,
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.580]   can influence our sense of wellbeing
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.000]   by these hormone pathways.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.600]   And the threshold there, again,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.960]   seemed to be about two hours a day.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.660]   It doesn't have to be very bright outside.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.320]   There can be cloud cover and so on.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.820]   Many people will probably ask,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.600]   will sunscreen inhibit this effect?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   And it doesn't appear that it does.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.960]   Obviously, prioritize skin health and avoiding skin cancer.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.640]   Sunscreen is kind of a controversial topic nowadays.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.340]   Maybe the topic for another podcast episode at some point.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.460]   But nonetheless, what the Perik et al study shows,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.360]   and that's most relevant to today's podcast,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.480]   is that we are entrained,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   we are matched to the external light-dark cycle.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.600]   And as the day length changes, our hormones change.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.240]   And we can override that with exposure to bright lights.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.360]   People go sit on tanning beds.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.440]   That's not a practice I particularly myself engage in,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.560]   but there are a number of different ways
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.720]   that people can override these processes.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.240]   But the point is very simple.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   The point is that our perception of time is both conscious,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.040]   it's waiting, watching the clock tick down,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.720]   and there are these slower, what we call oscillatory,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.280]   meaning up and down repeatedly,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   slower oscillatory events related to day length
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   that are influencing our hormones,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.160]   like melatonin, testosterone, and estrogen,
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.000]   and therefore our mood, our outlook,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.400]   and even our behavior.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.600]   The next level of time or bin of time, as we say,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.920]   that we are all entrained or matched to
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.600]   is the so-called circadian time cycle,
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.040]   which is 24-hour rhythm.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.560]   This is perhaps the most powerful rhythm
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.840]   that we all contain and that none of us can escape from.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.900]   We all have this circadian clock
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.760]   that resides over the roof of our mouth,
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.600]   the cells in that circadian clock fire,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.940]   meaning they release chemicals into our brain and body
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.280]   on a very regular rhythm.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.040]   So across the 24-hour cycle,
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.320]   they will be very active at some periods
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.220]   and less active at others.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.240]   Not surprisingly, there are periods of every 24-hour cycle
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.880]   when we are very active and we tend to be alert
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.040]   and others when we are asleep.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.800]   Now, I've talked a lot about circadian rhythms
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.080]   and sleep on this podcast previously,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.280]   and so I don't want to repeat too much of that information
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.100]   in detail, but I'm just going to give a summary
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.120]   of how circadian entrainment works
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.020]   because I haven't really covered that
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.720]   in the context of time perception.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.140]   We have the circadian clock.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.680]   It oscillates, it goes up and down once every 24 hours
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.800]   and then repeats.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   Every cell of our body has a 24-hour oscillation
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   in the expression of various genes.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.720]   How that works is actually really simple,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.160]   elegant, and interesting.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.360]   DNA genes make RNA.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.520]   RNA is converted into proteins.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.880]   Every cell in our body has this beautiful 24-hour timer
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.100]   where a gene is expressed.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.600]   And the important thing to understand about a given gene
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.220]   in this context is that that gene is inhibited,
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.720]   meaning it's reduced by a particular protein,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.800]   by a little biological molecule in that cell.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.400]   So the gene gets expressed when there's very little
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.320]   of that other molecule around.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   DNA then becomes RNA, RNA is translated into a protein,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.680]   and that protein goes way, way up and the gene shuts down.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.400]   But as that protein gets used up
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.620]   and its levels eventually drop low, low, low, low, low
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.460]   to zero, the gene cycle kicks in again
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.520]   and the gene gets expressed,
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.260]   the RNA gets expressed in the protein again.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.560]   This all happens on a 24-hour cycle.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.860]   So it's a little built-in timer in each and every one
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.700]   of our cells.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.880]   And I didn't list off the genes,
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.240]   but for the aficionados out there,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.400]   they go by names like per, for period, be, mal, clock,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.220]   and all these different things.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.280]   We call them the clock genes.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.860]   And those clock genes regulate a number
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.700]   of different functions.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.360]   So every cell in our body has a 24-hour cycle
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.480]   of gene and protein expression.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.820]   And the earth rotates once every 24 hours.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.560]   And the processes that are happening in every cell
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.700]   of our body are linked.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.520]   They are entrained, as we say,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.420]   to the outside light-dark cycle because morning sunlight,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.640]   evening sunlight, and the lack of light
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.160]   in the middle of the night make sure that the changes,
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.780]   these oscillations that are occurring within the cells
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.840]   of our brain and body are matched
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.560]   to the outside light-dark cycle.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.640]   And I want to go into all the details of how that happens,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.120]   but there's some very simple tools that one can use
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.620]   to ensure that your entrainment,
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.580]   your circadian entrainment is precise.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.660]   And I cannot emphasize enough how important it is
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.540]   that your circadian entrainment be precise.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.240]   Why?
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.840]   Because disruptions in circadian entrainment
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.260]   cause huge health problems.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.780]   They increase cancer risk.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.460]   They increase obesity.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.820]   They increase mental health issues.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.200]   They decrease wound healing.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.420]   They decrease physical and mental performance.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.740]   They disrupt hormones.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.600]   You want your cells to be linked to the circadian cycle
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.440]   that's outside you.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.180]   And the circadian cycle outside you mainly consists
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.920]   of when there's sunlight and when there is not.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.120]   And that's why the simple protocols to fall out
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.580]   of this whole discussion about circadian entrainment
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.680]   are the following.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.720]   View 10 to 30 minutes of bright light, ideally sunlight,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.400]   within an hour of waking,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.840]   assuming that you're waking early in the day,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.600]   especially you wake up early in the day,
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.840]   get outside, see sunlight.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.000]   Do that again in the afternoon or around evening,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.980]   10 to 30 minutes, depending on how bright it is outside.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.100]   Artificial lights throughout the day,
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.940]   or if you want to be awake and you wake up early
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.540]   and there's no sunlight outside,
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.380]   you can of course turn on artificial lights
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.280]   if you want to be awake,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.240]   but basically you want as much bright light,
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.600]   ideally from sunlight,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.640]   coming in through your eyes throughout the day.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.960]   And then in the evening,
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.320]   you want as little bright light coming in through your eyes.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.740]   I've said this over and over and over again on this podcast.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.240]   There's always a lot of negotiations,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.940]   but I want to make a few things clear.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.120]   Try not to wear sunglasses.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.240]   If you can do it safely,
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.340]   find to wear eyeglasses or contacts.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.040]   That's not going to be a problem.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.120]   The light viewing that you do
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.140]   and the avoidance of light at night,
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   set the fundamental layer of your time perception.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.440]   One of the best ways to disrupt your perception of time
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.920]   in the ways that we're going to talk about
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.240]   in the subsequent portions of the podcast
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.960]   is to disrupt your circadian clock.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.440]   And that is not a good thing
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.400]   for a number of different reasons.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.320]   There are other ways to so-called entrain
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.280]   your circadian clock.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.060]   One of the best ways to do that
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.960]   is to engage in physical activity
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.680]   at fairly regular times of day.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.740]   You don't have to do it every day,
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.360]   but if you're going to exercise,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.980]   try and exercise at a fairly consistent time of day.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.040]   Probably better to exercise than to not exercise,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.360]   even if you have to move that time of day.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.720]   But light, activity, and we'll talk about the third
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.920]   in a minute, food, are the major ways
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.140]   that you entrain your internal perception of time
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.640]   to the external events of the world,
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.520]   meaning that the turning of the earth
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.680]   and therefore the exposure to sunlight or not.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.840]   So in addition to the sunlight viewing in the morning
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.720]   and throughout the day and avoiding bright light at night
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.740]   of any kind, not just blue light,
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.080]   trying to get your activity, your exercise at fairly regular
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.000]   within plus or minus two hours from each day to the next
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.880]   is going to have a very positive effect
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.080]   on so-called circadian entrainment.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.760]   And also eating at fairly regular times.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.200]   However, this is exciting.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.680]   The data mainly point to the fact that you need to eat
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.860]   within more or less the same time window each day,
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.900]   not that you always need to eat your meals
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.720]   at exactly the same time.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.000]   So you don't necessarily have to eat lunch at noon
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.300]   and a snack at four and dinner at eight
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   in order to keep your circadian entrainment aligned or sharp.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.520]   You could, for instance, have a small snack at noon
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.620]   and then eat at two and then have dinner at six
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.760]   and then a small snack at eight.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.480]   It doesn't so much matter when the exact meals fall,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.080]   so much as that they fall more or less
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.540]   within a consistent period or phase of each 24 hour cycle.
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.200]   What happens when this circadian clock
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.320]   starts getting disrupted?
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.160]   I mean, this is after all an episode about time perception.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.340]   It's not an episode about circadian rhythms and entrainment.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.340]   Well, there's a classic study by Ashoff done in 1985
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.600]   that's now been repeated many times
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.080]   where they had people go into environments
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.480]   where they didn't have clocks and they didn't have windows
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.020]   and they didn't have watches.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.740]   And they were sometimes even in constant dark
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.180]   or constant light.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.500]   And they evaluated how well people perceive
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.200]   the passage of time on shorter timescales.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.760]   And what they found was really interesting.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.160]   What they found is that people underestimate
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   how long they were in these isolated environments.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.300]   So after 42 days or so, they'd ask people,
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.460]   how long do you think you've been in here?
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.140]   And people would say 28 days or 36 days.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.140]   They generally underestimated how long they had been
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.820]   in this very odd environment with no clocks or watches
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.540]   or exposure to sunlight or regular rhythms
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.300]   of artificial light.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.740]   In addition, they found that their perception
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.380]   of shorter time intervals was also really disrupted.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.400]   So if they asked them to measure off two minutes,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.720]   normally people are pretty good
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.740]   at measuring off two minutes.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:05.060]   People come within five to 15 seconds at most.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.460]   If you kind of had to sit there and just wait,
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.300]   you have a pretty good idea of when two minutes is up,
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.620]   you say two minutes is up.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.100]   Well, when people's circadian clocks
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.060]   or circadian entrainment, I should say, was disrupted,
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.780]   their perception of time measurement on shorter timescales
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.180]   of minutes or even seconds was greatly disrupted.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.700]   And as we'll see in a couple of minutes,
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.380]   that actually causes great problems
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.260]   for how you contend with work,
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.060]   how you contend with challenges of different kinds.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.900]   You want your circadian entrainment to be pretty locked in
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.860]   or pretty entrained to the outside light dark cycle
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.060]   so that your perception of time on shorter time intervals
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.100]   can be precise because the ability to perceive time
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.220]   accurately for the given task or given thing
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.340]   that you're involved in turns out to be one
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.700]   of the most fundamental ways that predicts how well
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.580]   or poorly you perform that thing or task.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.460]   So we've talked about circadian entrainment,
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.220]   the matching of the cells and tissues
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.340]   and organs of our body to the 365 day journey
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.320]   that the earth takes around the sun each year.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.820]   And we talked about circadian entrainment,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.200]   the way that the 24 hour genetic and protein clocks
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.940]   of each and every one of our cells is matched
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.700]   to the rotation of the earth on its axis
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.180]   and the exposure or lack of exposure to the sun
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.940]   because of that rotation on its axis.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.060]   Next, I'd like to talk about so-called
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.780]   ultradian entrainment.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.900]   Ultradian rhythms are rhythms of about 90 minutes or so.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.620]   And all of our existence is broken up
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.180]   into these 90 minute ultradian cycles.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.420]   When you go to sleep at night,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.180]   whether or not you sleep six hours or four hours
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.020]   or eight hours or 10 hours,
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.700]   that entire period of sleep is broken up
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.260]   into these 90 minute ultradian cycles.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.260]   Early in the night, you tend to have more slow wave sleep.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.320]   Later in the night, you tend to have more REM sleep.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.700]   But nonetheless, your sleep is broken up
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.400]   into these 90 minute cycles.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.660]   However, when you wake up in the morning,
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.780]   many of the things that you do are governed
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.920]   by these ultradian rhythms.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.100]   For instance, if you were to work,
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.280]   meaning do math or try and learn a language
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.740]   or do physical work of any kind or work out,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.780]   the 90 minute time block seems to be the one
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.100]   in which the brain can enter a state of focus
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.640]   and alertness and do hard work and focus, focus, focus.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.680]   And then at about 90 minutes,
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.100]   there's a significant drop in your ability
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.060]   to engage in this mental or physical work.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.380]   Now, everybody from the self-help literature
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.380]   to the business literature to the pop psychology literature
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.020]   has tried to leverage these ultradian cycles
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.700]   by saying if you're going to do something hard
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.740]   and you want to focus on it,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.100]   limit it to 90 minutes or less.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.140]   And I am one of those people
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.860]   who's also joined that conversation.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.100]   And indeed I use 90 minute work cycles.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.700]   And I think they are extremely powerful.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.540]   One should never expect that you're going to drop
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.660]   immediately into a state of high focus at the beginning
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.620]   and then remain there for 90 minutes.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.860]   We all struggle to varying degrees to achieve focus
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.580]   and motivation and drive within those 90 minute cycles.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.500]   But it is true, meaning there is ample literature
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.720]   to support the idea that after about 90 minutes,
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.440]   we tend to go into a state of less ability to focus.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.900]   So while this isn't time perception per se,
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.760]   it is again, an example of entrainment.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.180]   What are we in training to, right?
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.020]   Just because we can focus for 90 minutes
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.560]   and then not so well at 100 minutes or 120 minutes,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.640]   what are we in training to?
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.780]   Well, what you're in training to
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.800]   is the release of particular neurochemicals,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.180]   in this case, acetylcholine and dopamine
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.140]   that allow your brain to focus
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.240]   for particular periods of time, 90 minutes or so.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.500]   And after about 90 minutes or so,
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.620]   the amount of those chemicals that can be released
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.600]   tends to drop very low,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.760]   which is why your ability to focus becomes diminished.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.600]   If one would like to explore more about the kind of backbone
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.640]   and basis of these ultradian rhythms,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.880]   it goes by a different name.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.960]   This was originally called the basic rest activity cycle.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.620]   This was proposed many years ago by Nathaniel Kleitman.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.940]   It was established to be true within sleep states,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.920]   as I mentioned before.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.440]   Then it was debated for a long time
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   whether or not these 90-minute cycles
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.000]   also control our ability to focus and perform work
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   in wakeful states, and it turns out that they do.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.800]   Now there's a lot of literature to support that.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.840]   I always get the question,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.160]   how do you know when the 90-minute cycle begins?
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.200]   In other words, let's say you wake up at 8 a.m.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.340]   and you just finished a 90-minute sleep cycle.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.100]   Does that mean that your next 90-minute cycle
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.680]   where you could do work begins right at 801?
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.740]   No.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.720]   The interesting thing about these basic rest activity cycles,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.040]   these ultradian rhythms,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.100]   is that you can initiate them whenever you want.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.820]   This is not like a circadian rhythm,
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.820]   which is a hardwired, unerring signal of 24 hours.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.220]   The ultradian rhythms that occur during sleep
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.820]   are hardwired, unerring.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.200]   You don't get the option of making your sleep cycles
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.480]   at 120 minutes or five minutes.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.640]   You don't get that option.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.700]   But if you decide that you want to apply
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.140]   ultradian rhythms to work and performance,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.940]   you can set a clock and decide,
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.240]   okay, now the focus begins.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.880]   Now the work begins, and this 90-minute cycle
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.660]   is the period in which I'm going to do work.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.240]   And I actually do this.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.000]   Mid-morning and sometimes twice a day,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.720]   I do a 90-minute cycle where I limit all distraction
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.340]   as much as possible, put away my phone,
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.760]   often turn off the internet as well.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.540]   I talked about this in an episode
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.520]   on kind of an optimal workday, at least for me,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.700]   just to give an example of how this might work.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.860]   But I want to emphasize again
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.040]   that these ultradian rhythms are ones that you set.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.600]   So you decide I'm going to work for 90 minutes.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.640]   What you can't negotiate, however,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.760]   is that at about 100 minutes or 120 minutes,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.720]   no matter who you are,
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.680]   you're going to see a diminishment in performance.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.900]   You're not going to focus as well.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.260]   And that's, again, because of the way
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.260]   that these 90-minute cycles are linked
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.720]   to the ability of the neurons
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.680]   that release acetylcholine and dopamine
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.080]   and to some extent norepinephrine,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.020]   the things that give us narrow focus, motivation, and drive,
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.800]   the way that these 90-minute cycles
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.920]   are involved in those circuits.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.040]   After about 90 minutes,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.660]   those circuits are far less willing to engage,
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.440]   and therefore it's much harder
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.640]   to continue to focus to a high degree.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.960]   Some people like to do multiple 90-minute cycles
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.840]   per day of focus.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.580]   In that case, you need to separate them out.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.220]   You can't do one 90-minute cycle,
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.200]   then go right into another 90-minute cycle then.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.160]   Go down to the 90-minute cycle.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.360]   You can't cheat these circuits related
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.040]   to acetylcholine and dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.240]   unfortunately.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.180]   I suggest that people do no more than three,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.260]   and ideally it would be two or just one
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.340]   of these 90-minute cycles.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.440]   Why did I say ideally?
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.580]   Well, they are very taxing.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.320]   You are in a very narrow tunnel of focus.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.960]   So for me, I can do one mid-morning,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.240]   and I can probably do another one in the afternoon.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.360]   This is not the kind of work that's like checking email
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.840]   or text messaging or social media.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.800]   This is very focused, hard work,
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.680]   and it's working on hard problems of various kinds,
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.720]   and this will be different for everybody.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.240]   So I recommend that they be spaced
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.600]   by at least two to four hours,
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.640]   and most people probably won't be able
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.900]   to handle more than two per day.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.240]   There are probably some mutants out there
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.220]   that could do three or four, but that's exceedingly rare.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.200]   I think even one a day is going to feel
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.480]   like a significant mental investment,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.820]   and afterwards you're going to feel pretty taxed.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.780]   So now we've talked about circannual,
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.020]   circadian, and ultradian rhythms,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.360]   but we haven't really talked about time perception per se.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.900]   We've mainly talked about the subconscious,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.260]   slow oscillatory ways in which we are entrained
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.800]   or matched to the year or to the day,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.360]   and these ultradian cycles that we can impose on our work
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.080]   and that we can leverage toward more focus if we like.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.020]   But what about the actual perception of time?
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.760]   What actually controls how fast or how slowly
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.260]   we perceive time going by?
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.040]   There are basically three forms of time perception
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.800]   that we should all be aware of.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.720]   One is our perception of the passage of time in the present,
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.480]   how quickly or slowly things seem to be happening for us.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.620]   This is kind of like an interval timer, ticking off time,
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.360]   tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.360]   It's either fine slicing like that or tick, tick, tick.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.440]   We have interval timers.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.720]   I'll discuss the basis of those interval timers.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.420]   We also engage in what's called prospective timing,
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.660]   which is like a stopwatch,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.220]   measuring off things as they go forward.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.140]   That might sound a little bit like what I just described,
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.240]   but it's actually a little bit different.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.840]   For instance, if I told you to start measuring off
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.800]   a two-minute time interval into the future,
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.820]   you could do that pretty well.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.960]   But if I told you you had to measure
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.360]   a five-minute time interval into the future
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.760]   and you couldn't use any clocks or watches or your phone
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.320]   or anything like that, you would have to set the tick marks.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.080]   You would have to decide how many times
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.240]   you were going to count off
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.920]   during that five-minute time block.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.060]   There's also retrospective time,
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.680]   which is how you measure off time in the past.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.740]   So if I say, "Last week, I know you went to the park.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.040]   You did some things with friends.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.320]   You went out in the evening."
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.000]   How long was it between lunch
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.300]   and when you went to dinner with friends?
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.880]   You probably then go, "Okay, well, I remember.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.840]   I went to dinner at seven and we had lunch right around two."
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.760]   You're using memory to reconstruct
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.560]   certain sets of events in the past
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.360]   and get a sense of their relative positioning within time.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.760]   So we have retrospective,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.280]   current time interval measurements,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   and then a prospective time measurement into the future.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:54.660]   The beauty of time perception in the human nervous system
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.140]   is that it boils down to a couple of simple molecules
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.160]   that govern whether or not we are fine slicing time
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.360]   or whether or not we are batching time in larger bins.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.960]   Those molecules go by names that maybe you've heard,
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.160]   things like dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.280]   neuromodulators, called neuromodulators,
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.240]   because they modulate,
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.600]   they change the way that other neural circuits work.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.200]   Also things like serotonin.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.660]   Serotonin is released from a different site in the brain
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.880]   than dopamine and norepinephrine is,
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.080]   and has a different effect on time perception.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.400]   So just to give you an example
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   of how things like dopamine and serotonin
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.320]   can modulate our perception of time,
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.940]   I want to focus on a little bit of literature
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.860]   that now has been done, fortunately, in animals and humans,
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.180]   and which essentially shows that the more dopamine
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.420]   that's released into our brain,
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.580]   the more we tend to overestimate the amount of time
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.180]   that has just passed.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.040]   Let me repeat that.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.440]   The more dopamine that is released into our brain,
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.020]   the more we tend to overestimate how much time has passed.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.960]   These experiments are very straightforward, excuse me,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.000]   and they're very objective, which is really nice,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.560]   which is you can give people or an animal a drug
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.780]   that increases the amount of dopamine,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.240]   and then ask them to measure off
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.440]   without any measurement device, like a watch or a clock,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.860]   when one minute has passed.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.520]   As dopamine levels rise in the brain,
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   people tend to think that the minute is up before a minute.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.080]   So at the 38-second mark, they'll say,
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.160]   "Okay, I think a minute is up."
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.960]   So they've overestimated how much time has passed, okay?
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.560]   The higher the level of dopamine,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.680]   the more people tend to overestimate.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.140]   Now, it's also true that norepinephrine,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.400]   also called noradrenaline, plays a role,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.960]   and its role is very similar to that of dopamine.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.880]   And that's because norepinephrine and dopamine
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.000]   are close cousins.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.080]   As some of you may recall that they are actually manufactured
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.400]   from one another, okay?
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.480]   So dopamine can actually make epinephrine
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.360]   and norepinephrine.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.960]   Biochemically, there's a cascade in which dopamine
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.400]   can be made into norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.960]   which is remarkable.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   How does having elevated levels of dopamine
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.720]   and norepinephrine cause one to overestimate
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.540]   how much time has passed?
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.800]   Well, it does it because of the way
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.360]   that it causes fine slicing of your time bins.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.400]   So fine slicing of time bins is like increasing
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.220]   the frame rate on your camera, right?
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.220]   Slow motion is achieved in movies and elsewhere
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.400]   by increasing the frame rate.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.200]   So if you take a movie at 30 frames per second and watch it,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.160]   it will appear to have a certain speed, right?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.700]   'Cause those are just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.220]   In contrast, if you took that same movie
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.500]   at 4,000 frames per second, you are fine slicing
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.780]   and you're going to see every little detail.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.780]   And as you play each one of those frames,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.980]   it's going to look like it moved slower, okay?
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.540]   Whatever, so the kind of jump shot in basketball
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.060]   that's done slowly, any slow motion is the consequence
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.780]   of higher frame rate.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.340]   So dopamine and norepinephrine increase frame rate.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.420]   And as a consequence, they tend to lead us
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.520]   to overestimate the amount of time that's passed.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.100]   Conversely, the neuromodulator serotonin causes people
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.560]   to underestimate the amount of time that's passed.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.220]   So they've done these experiments.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.220]   They actually have done these experiments using in humans
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.820]   with drugs that increase serotonin.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.620]   They've also done them with cannabis,
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.820]   which increases serotonin among other things,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.940]   including the cannabinoid receptor activation.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.220]   And when people have elevated levels of 5-HT
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.980]   or whether or not they've ingested cannabis,
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.520]   they tend to underestimate how much time has passed.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.660]   You do the equivalent experiment.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.060]   You tell people that they have to guess
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.380]   or tell you when five minutes, for instance, has passed,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.500]   just to use five minutes as an example this time,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.460]   and generally they will miss the five-minute mark.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.900]   They will think, they'll let six minutes pass
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.380]   and it looks like it was five minutes
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.140]   when they've underestimated how much time has passed.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.740]   And that's because serotonin and some of the related
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.740]   molecules in the brain tend to lead to slower frame rates.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.880]   They take the frame rate from, in the example I used before,
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.300]   from 4,000 frames per second down to say 20 frames per second
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.320]   So this is very interesting.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.400]   It's interesting in terms of how pharmacology can be used
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.160]   to adjust time perception, but it's also interesting
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.260]   in the context of that circadian rhythm.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.660]   There's some emerging evidence that throughout
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.900]   the 24-hour cycle, there are robust changes
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.380]   in the amount of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.680]   that are present in the brain and bloodstream and body,
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.680]   depending on time of day within the circadian cycle.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.700]   Now I'm not talking about during sleep.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.620]   During sleep, there are definitely variations
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.700]   in things like dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.060]   I talked about that in the episodes on sleep.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.360]   Here I'm just talking about the role of these molecules
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.900]   in time perception during wakefulness.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.100]   So much of the evidence points to the fact
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.020]   that in the first half of the day,
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.940]   approximate first half of the day,
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.580]   dopamine and norepinephrine are elevated in the brain,
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.860]   body, and bloodstream much more than is serotonin.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.340]   And that in the second half of the day,
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.100]   and in particular towards evening and nighttime,
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.500]   serotonin levels are going up.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.800]   I think that's fairly well-established now.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.440]   What that means based on what we just discussed
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.780]   about the role of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.220]   in setting the frame rate of time perception
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.940]   is that our perception of the passage of time
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.360]   will be very different in the early part of the day
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.360]   and in the latter half of the day.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.060]   And there's starting to be some evidence to support this,
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.980]   that early in the day,
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.080]   people tend to overestimate how much time has passed.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.920]   And later in the day,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.020]   they tend to underestimate how much time has passed.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.200]   And this is independent of taking any kind of substance
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   that would increase or decrease dopamine or serotonin.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.960]   Now, this is important in terms of how one thinks
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.160]   about structuring their day,
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.200]   because I know many people are thinking about
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.000]   the various tasks that they need to do
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.760]   throughout their day.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.220]   Many, or I should say all of the literature at least
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.400]   that I can find on productivity and things of that sort
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.860]   point to the idea that we should be doing the hardest task,
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.460]   the thing that we want to do the least
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.440]   or the most important task early in the day
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.780]   as a kind of a psychological tool for getting it done
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.680]   and feeling as if we accomplished something.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.760]   And I think that's an excellent protocol, frankly.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.520]   But I'm not sure it's an excellent protocol
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.340]   because of the way that we sense accomplishment,
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.760]   or at least it's not only an excellent protocol
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.040]   because of the way that we sense accomplishment.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.880]   Another reason to move something that's very hard
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   into the early part of the day
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.880]   is that if indeed the dopaminergic and noradrenergic circuits
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.580]   are more active at that time,
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.880]   we are actually in a better position cognitively
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.840]   to parse that hard problem
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.480]   because of the way that we are able to fine slice
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.720]   our perception of time
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.840]   and fine slice all the perceptual events outside us.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.960]   So what I'm really saying is that early in the day
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.900]   you are a much more high resolution camera, so to speak,
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.660]   than you are later in the day.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.840]   Now, different types of tasks and different types of things
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.000]   require different frame rates
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.160]   or different ways of perceiving time.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.960]   And indeed this also lends itself to a tool
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.040]   whereby for activities that involve more kind of
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.920]   creative thinking that aren't as constrained
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.480]   by particular answers or outcomes,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.120]   and in which we need to kind of blend different aspects
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.720]   of our memory, different aspects of task utilization,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.000]   in other words, for creative works, for brainstorming,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.900]   for things that are a bit more fluid, so to speak,
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.400]   the more serotonergic second half of the day,
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.160]   and because of the way the serotonergic
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.440]   second half of the day lends itself to our time perception,
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.520]   may actually be more beneficial for those sorts of tasks.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.720]   And I'll put a reference to a couple of the studies
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.240]   that point to this idea
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.340]   that in these higher dopaminergic states,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.800]   we are better at doing certain sorts of tasks,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.520]   and in these more serotonergic states,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.840]   we're better at doing other sorts of tasks,
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.920]   and how the dopamine tends to be earlier in the day
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.200]   and the serotonin later in the day, so to speak,
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.800]   these are broad, I'm painting with broad strokes here,
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.280]   but I think these lend themselves
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.720]   to some really excellent tools,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.020]   because I think we all understand the value
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.880]   of doing something that's hard or challenging
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   early in the day, but we should ask ourselves,
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.580]   hard or challenging how?
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.960]   What does that task actually really require
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.600]   in terms of time perception?
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.240]   Some people might appreciate some examples
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.360]   of how this might work.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.760]   Basically what I'm saying is if you are doing work
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.000]   that involves adhering to some rigid rules,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.800]   so math or a recipe or execution of musical scales
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.420]   or physical skills or accounting
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.560]   or something that requires a lot of precision
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.960]   where there's a right and wrong answer and it's hard,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.120]   I would suggest that you do that
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.300]   in the early part of the day
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.840]   because of the way that dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.400]   impact time perception.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.680]   You are literally better at slicing up time.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.040]   You are a higher resolution brain during those times,
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.000]   and so that's going to lend itself better
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.740]   to events and demands that require high resolution,
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.600]   whereas in the afternoon,
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.200]   in this more of what I'm calling serotonergic state,
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.360]   that's when you're going to be better at brainstorming
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.120]   and creative works where there's some flexibility
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.200]   in terms of how you're batching time and perceiving time,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.220]   and there isn't so much rigid oversight
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.920]   of a right or wrong answer.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.280]   And as an aside to support what I said,
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.400]   but also to take us back to this critical role
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.840]   of the circadian rhythm, there is a lot of evidence
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.240]   that when one's sleep is disrupted,
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.020]   when sleep is either too short or is fragmented
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.280]   or is not of high enough quality for enough days,
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.360]   one of the first things to happen
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.680]   is that there is a dysregulation
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.240]   of these dopaminergic, neurodegenergic,
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.020]   and serotonergic states throughout the day.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.780]   They get kind of mish-mashed up.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.460]   It's not that they're a total mess,
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.280]   but they aren't as cleanly defined.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.720]   And I think this is one of the reasons
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.080]   why when we haven't slept well or we haven't slept enough,
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.680]   we tend to feel a little off, like we can't concentrate.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.340]   Part of that lack of concentration is due to other things.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.260]   But part of that concentration could be due to the fact
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.200]   that our sense of the passage of time is disrupted.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.560]   So there seems to be some value
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.380]   in keeping the dopaminergic, neurodegenergic state
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.200]   kind of limited to the early part of the day
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.360]   and the serotonergic state, as we're calling it,
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.840]   kind of pushed towards the second half of the day.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.820]   Now, there is a version of how dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.440]   can impact our perception of the passage of time
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.960]   in ways that can be very disruptive or even maladaptive.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.960]   And the best example that I'm aware of is trauma.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.640]   Many people who have been in car accidents
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.960]   or who have experienced some other form of major trauma
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.640]   do what's called overclocking.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.440]   Overclocking is when levels of dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   increase so much during a particular event.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.920]   Our level of alertness has increased so much
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.080]   during a given event that we find slice.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.840]   In other words, the frame rate is increased so much so
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.960]   that we perceive things as happening in ultra slow motion.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.120]   Now, that might not seem like a bad thing overall,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.800]   but the problem with overclocking is the way
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.960]   in which that information gets stamped down
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.640]   into the memory system.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.740]   So the memory system, which involves areas of the brain
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.540]   like the hippocampus, but also the neocortex,
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.420]   is basically a space-time recorder.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.120]   What do I mean by space-time recorder?
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.400]   Well, your nervous system, of course,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.980]   is housed in the darkness of your skull.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.460]   It doesn't have a whole lot of information
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.320]   about the outside world except light coming in
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.620]   through the eyes and whatever happens to hit our ears
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.280]   in terms of sound waves and skin and so forth.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.080]   So it has to take all those neural signals
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.400]   and it has to create a record of what happened.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.640]   Now, it doesn't create a record of everything that happened,
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.140]   but car accidents and trauma and things of that sort
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.480]   oftentimes are stamped down
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.320]   into our record of what happened.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.720]   And what gets stamped down,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.240]   what we actually mean by the phrase stamped down,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.760]   is that the precise firing of the sequence of neurons
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.000]   that reflected some event,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.880]   so let's say I'm in a car accident,
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.240]   certain neurons are firing because of the flipping
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.320]   of the car or there's screams or there's blood
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.380]   or things of that sort.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:42.240]   All of that neural activity gets repeated
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.160]   in the hippocampus and then the sequence of the firing
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.860]   of those neurons is also remembered.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.160]   So it's not just that neuron one, two, three, four fired
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.940]   in that sequence, it's also that neuron one, two, three, four
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.420]   fired at a particular rate.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.920]   So it would be one, two, three, four during the actual event
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.000]   and then the memory is stored as firing of those neurons
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.360]   as one, two, three, four, right?
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.020]   If during the event it was one, two, three, four
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.820]   at that rate, the storage of the memory
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:12.200]   is not going to be one, two, three, four, okay?
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.680]   In other words, there's both a space code as we say,
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.640]   meaning the particular neurons that fire is important
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.200]   and there's a rate code, how quickly those neurons fire
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.920]   or the relative firing, the timing of the firing
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.880]   of those neurons is also part of the memory.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.280]   This affords our memory system tremendous flexibility.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.760]   What it means is that you can take the same set of neurons
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.560]   in the hippocampus and stamp down many, many more memories
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.540]   because all you have to do is use a match
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.800]   of the different rates of the different neurons
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.920]   that were firing in order to set that code, right?
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.860]   Otherwise, if you needed a different set of neurons
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.000]   for every memory, you need an enormous hippocampus,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.180]   you need an enormous head.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.440]   So I think you get the basic idea.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.960]   Overclocking is a case in which the frame rate is so high
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.140]   that a memory gets stamped down
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.560]   and people have a very hard time shaking that memory
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.840]   and the emotions associated with that memory.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.040]   And it's not the topic of today's conversation
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.080]   but we will cover trauma in a future episode in detail
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.320]   but many of the treatments for trauma, EMDR,
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.840]   nowadays there's a lot of excitement also
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.900]   about ketamine therapies, exposure therapies,
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.740]   like cognitive behavioral therapies,
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.240]   involve not just trying to reduce the amount
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   of emotion associated with a memory
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.320]   but also a deliberate speeding up
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.360]   or slowing down of that memory.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.880]   In other words, trying to allow the person
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.780]   who experienced the trauma to take control
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.200]   of the rate of the experience in their memory,
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.040]   not just whether or not the memory happened at all.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.640]   In fact, one of the first things that trauma victims learn
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.340]   is that they aren't going to forget what happened.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.840]   What's eventually going to happen,
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.600]   ideally with good treatment,
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.760]   is that the emotional weight of the experience
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.040]   will eventually be divorced
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.960]   from the memory of the experience.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.360]   And that's done again by trying to reduce
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.240]   the amount of emotional activation
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.880]   during the recall of that experience.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.600]   And one of the best ways to do that
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.020]   is to alter the rate of the memory playback.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.020]   In other words, taking that firing of neurons
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.240]   that might've been one, two, three, four,
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.880]   again, it would be much more complicated,
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.720]   but one, two, three, four for the car crash,
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.520]   and getting the memory to play back at a rate of one,
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.800]   two, three, four, or even one, two, three, four,
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.360]   one, two, three, four.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.920]   In other words, allowing the person
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.640]   or instructing the person to take control
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.920]   of the rate of the playback.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.800]   And in that way, there seems to be
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.560]   still yet unknown mechanism
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.700]   by which people can uncouple some of the emotional weight
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.480]   that's associated with that memory.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.400]   So overclocking is a kind of extreme example
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.120]   of where the dopaminergic and the noradrenergic system
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.280]   is ramped up so high that people have this,
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.640]   unfortunately, what seems like indelible mark
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.400]   in their brain of a particular event.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.000]   But again, trauma treatment is designed
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.560]   to uncouple the emotional load of that event.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.880]   Some of you are probably saying, why dopamine during trauma?
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.320]   I thought dopamine was the feel-good molecule.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.480]   Well, in reality,
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.120]   dopamine is not necessarily a molecule of reward,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.080]   it's a molecule of motivation, pursuit, and drive.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.800]   And because of the close relationship
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.520]   between dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.560]   oftentimes they are co-released.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.000]   So whether or not dopamine is released during car crashes
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.140]   or other forms of trauma, we don't know.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.620]   But what we do know is that both the dopamine system
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.200]   and noradrenergic system, when we say noradrenergic,
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.260]   when we mean norepinephrine,
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.200]   those systems are greatly increased
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.600]   anytime there's a heightened state of arousal.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.880]   And arousal can have negative valence,
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.160]   like meaning associated with an event that we really hate,
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.080]   that we would prefer not to be involved in,
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.040]   or it can have positive valence.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.640]   But dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.680]   are kind of the common hallmark
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.440]   of all things of elevated arousal.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.400]   And so that's why we see evidence for dopamine
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.200]   being associated with these changes in time perception,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.020]   both for positive events and for negative events.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.880]   There's a very interesting relationship
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   between arousal, dopamine, time perception, and blinking.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.360]   And this is all supported by a really interesting paper.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.520]   First author Terhune is the last name,
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.360]   T-E-R-H-U-N-E, is published in Current Biology,
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.240]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.080]   The title of the paper is
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.100]   "Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking."
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.360]   So heightened states of arousal
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.220]   are associated with heightened levels of dopamine.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.180]   You now know that dopamine leads
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.440]   to a kind of fine slicing of time.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.240]   And one of the ways that we fine slice time is by blinking.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.180]   You know, we think of blinking
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.040]   as just a thing to like lubricate our eyes
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.440]   or to limit the amount of light coming into our eyes,
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.020]   but it's a shutter on our experience.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.500]   So much of the information
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.980]   that coming into the brain through our eyes
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.980]   impacts our attention.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.500]   I've said it before on this podcast
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.760]   that cognitive attention follows visual attention,
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.700]   at least for sighted individuals.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.920]   Well, it turns out that dopamine and increases in dopamine
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.320]   are associated with increases in spontaneous blink rate.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.000]   So the more aroused we are, the more awake we are.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.840]   There are a number of effects,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.080]   pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.980]   but also blink rate increases.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.240]   And every time we blink, this study cleanly shows,
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.040]   we shift our perception of time,
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:20.280]   leading to, as I mentioned before, overestimations of time.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.520]   So it seems as though in some way,
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.700]   blink rate is actually related to frame rate.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.840]   And so this is very, very interesting.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.160]   And the way that you could think about leveraging this
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.960]   would be if you wanted to actually slow down
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.880]   your perception of time, you would blink less.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.440]   And if you want to speed up your perception of time,
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.440]   you would blink more.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.200]   Now you'd have to think of a scenario
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   in which that would be useful to you.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.100]   Obviously, if you're going to blink,
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.900]   you're going to miss things as well.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.780]   But I think it's a very interesting parameter
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.140]   of our visual attention as it relates to time perception,
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.700]   because what it really speaks to
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.820]   is that these neuromodulators like dopamine or serotonin
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.780]   that adjust frame rate,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.300]   they're not doing it through some magical mechanism.
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.500]   In fact, there's no single brain area
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.140]   that we can say controls time perception.
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.860]   I haven't said today, oh, you know, it's the striatum.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.440]   Well, it involves the striatum,
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.220]   but I'm not going to say, for instance,
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.340]   oh, it's the cerebellum.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.940]   The cerebellum is definitely involved
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:18.600]   in timing of movement, something for a future podcast,
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.360]   but time perception is what we call a distributed phenomenon.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.420]   It's a network of areas in the brain working together,
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.080]   but dopamine in the way that it relates
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.940]   to the shuttering of your eyes
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.360]   seems to be controlling the frame rate on your experience.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.780]   Numerous times on this podcast,
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.460]   I've talked about cold exposure,
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.240]   and nowadays there's a lot of interest
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.320]   in things like cold showers, ice baths,
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.140]   submersion in cold water tanks,
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.860]   and lakes and oceans and things of that sort.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.780]   There are a lot of different positive effects
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.400]   of cold exposure.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.500]   Provided it's done properly,
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.240]   it can lead to increases in metabolism,
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.220]   brown fat stores, which are the good fat stores
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.060]   that you want.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.500]   They're sort of like a furnace
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.700]   that allow you to heat yourself up,
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.740]   stay warm in cold environments to reduce inflammation,
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.540]   to increase resilience and so forth.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.780]   There's a study published
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.300]   in the European Journal of Physiology
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.420]   showing that cold exposure can increase
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.040]   our baseline levels of dopamine robustly, 2.5X,
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.080]   and it's a long-lasting increase in dopamine,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.300]   and it appears to be a healthy one,
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.940]   meaning it doesn't seem to be addictive.
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.060]   I'm sure there are some people out there addicted to ice baths
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.940]   but when you think about the range
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:27.420]   of dopamine-inducing behaviors that are addictive,
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.860]   it seems to be more on the health-promoting side.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.840]   What's interesting is that
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.800]   because cold water exposure increases dopamine,
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.880]   it will also change your perception of time.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.960]   And if you've ever done one of these cold water exposures,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.420]   you've experienced this.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.360]   You've experienced getting in and feeling like, wow,
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.920]   making it three minutes is a really, really long time.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.580]   And you are fine slicing time.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.020]   Your frame rate is going up.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:52.400]   Part of that, just at a kind of a coarse level,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.600]   as you're thinking, this is painful, I don't like this,
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.420]   I want to get out, right?
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.880]   But part of it is also that your dopamine levels
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.380]   are going up very quickly,
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.300]   and therefore your perception of that discomfort
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.180]   is also being fine sliced.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.820]   And so you could leverage a tool, for instance,
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.020]   where you try and entrain your thinking
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:12.980]   to something other than your immediate experience, right?
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:15.760]   This is a kind of a controversy, if you will,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.420]   in the cold exposure world.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.360]   The question is, do you try and lean into the experience
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.880]   and really feel it, or do you try and distract yourself?
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:29.140]   Sing a song or count off from one to 100.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.640]   Just know that whatever tactic you use
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.920]   to get through the cold exposure,
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.680]   that the dopamine level that's now increased in your system
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.280]   is going to cause you to fine slice
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.060]   or experience that at slow motion.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.300]   So a minute is going to seem like a lot longer
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.980]   than a minute in reality.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.380]   So you could, for instance,
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:55.060]   decide to pay attention to some external cue.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.540]   Maybe it's a metronome that ticks once every 10 seconds.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.320]   You could decide to think about something else.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.300]   You could decide to sing a song in your head
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.780]   or sing a song out loud.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.340]   All of that will divorce you from the sensation
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.520]   that you're experienced somewhat,
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.380]   but more so it will divorce you from the perception
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.740]   of your experience
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.640]   as governed by that dopamine increase in frame rate.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.780]   If that isn't clear, just know this.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.940]   When you're in the ice bath, your dopamine levels are high.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.700]   When your dopamine levels are high,
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.100]   your experience of the discomfort of that ice bath
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.220]   is at higher resolution.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.180]   Now, up until now, I've been talking about how dopamine
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.740]   and to some extent serotonin
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.300]   can differentially impact your perception of how fast
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.300]   or how slowly things are happening in the moment.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.820]   But remember, we have prospective time,
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.100]   we have our experience of time in the moment,
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.380]   and we have retrospective time.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.180]   And there are beautiful studies that have showed
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:56.040]   that the dopaminergic state changes the way,
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.380]   not just that we experience things now,
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.740]   but that it changes the way
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.060]   in which we remember things in the past
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.560]   and the rate at which those things occurred.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.100]   And those are in opposite direction.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.700]   So to make this very simple,
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:15.520]   if something that you experience is fun or varied,
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.620]   meaning it has a lot of different components in it,
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.660]   and is, in other words, is associated
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.060]   with an increase in dopamine in your brain,
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:29.200]   you will experience that as going by very fast.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.780]   Now, this is different than the ice bath,
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.980]   which I just said you experience as going by very slowly,
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.940]   but here I'm talking about something that's fun
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.660]   and varied that you really like,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.780]   and you'll feel like it goes by very, very fast.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.280]   Imagine an amazing day for a kid in an amusement park.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.340]   They can do a ton of things.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.280]   It's all new.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.760]   They're very excited,
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.380]   and they'll feel like it goes by very fast.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.220]   But later, they will remember that experience
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.580]   as being very long,
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.540]   that it was a long day full of many, many events.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.340]   And so there's this paradoxical relationship
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.440]   between how we perceive fun, exciting, varied events
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.200]   in the present and how we remember them in the past.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.340]   For those of you who have gone on vacation,
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.040]   if you've had an amazing day on vacation,
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.280]   it'll seem like, or an amazing vacation overall,
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.180]   it will seem like it goes by very fast.
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.540]   The last day of vacation, you sort of go,
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.680]   whoa, it went by so fast 'cause there's so much happening.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.700]   But in memory, six to eight months later, you remember,
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:26.700]   wow, that just went, you know, that was a long, long thing.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.980]   We had this, then we had that, then we did this,
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.820]   then we had that.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.740]   It tends to spool out in a longer memory
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.740]   than the actual experience.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.460]   Conversely, if you are bored with something
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.280]   or it's something you really don't like,
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.680]   it's going to seem like it takes a long time
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.180]   to go through that experience in the moment.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:48.060]   But retroactively, looking back,
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.260]   it will seem like that moment was very short.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.940]   So if the other day I was waiting in the waiting room
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.800]   for the dentist, it was pretty boring.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.940]   I was just kind of sitting there.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.740]   There wasn't much going on.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.040]   And it did seem like it was going on an awfully long time.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.820]   But indeed, looking back, it just seems like,
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.980]   okay, I sat in that room, not much happened.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.620]   And so it seems like a very short time been.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.380]   This seems to be an efficiency
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.240]   of how the brain stores information.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.320]   Dopamine being associated, of course,
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.360]   with fun and varied experiences
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.600]   and low dopamine being associated with kind of empty,
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.000]   boring, or what at the time seemed like long experiences.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.420]   And this whole thing has been stamped down
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.620]   into the scientific literature by those earlier experiments
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.620]   where they take human beings
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.620]   and isolate them in certain environments.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.380]   You know, take away all the clocks and watches and cues
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:35.420]   and about what time of day it is
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.700]   and what time of night it is
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.220]   and allow people to have a life
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.180]   where they can either read and work and do things
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.140]   or where they have very little to do.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.540]   When people are isolated in very boring environments
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.420]   and they don't have access to time cues, time dilates.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:55.860]   They tend to assume that time has gone on very, very long.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.100]   And so the reason I bring this up is
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.460]   we aren't just driven by these circadian clocks
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.700]   and these circannual clocks and these ultradian clocks.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.880]   We are driven by these timers
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.660]   that vary depending on our level of excitement.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.480]   And they vary on depending on our level of excitement
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.100]   because of these neuromodulators, dopamine and serotonin.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.620]   So the way I like to think about it
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.740]   is that you have two clocks, two stopwatches.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.220]   One is a dopaminergic stopwatch
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.200]   that fine slices really closely.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.740]   It's like counts off milliseconds
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.820]   and it's grabbing a movie of your experience
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.180]   at very high resolution.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.260]   And then the other hand, you have a stopwatch
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.860]   that's gathering big time bins,
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:39.860]   big ticks along the hand is moving at bigger intervals,
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.440]   marking off time.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.540]   And depending on whether or not you're excited
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.700]   or whether or not you're bored,
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.740]   you're using different stopwatches on time
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.980]   and therefore you're perceiving your experience differently.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.420]   One very interesting aspect to the way that neuromodulators
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.740]   like dopamine and novelty interact with time perception
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:03.820]   and memory is how we perceive our relationship
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.640]   to places and people.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.720]   So really interesting literature showing
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.560]   that the more novel experiences we have in a place,
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.580]   the more we feel we know that place obviously,
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.420]   but the longer we feel we've been there.
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.780]   So here's the kind of gedanken or thought experiment
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.280]   that illustrates what's in the literature.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.900]   Let's say I were to move to New York City.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.200]   I happen to really like New York City.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.040]   I've never lived there,
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.840]   but let's say I lived there.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.320]   I lived in a given apartment for a year
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.380]   and I would have a number of different experiences.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.680]   In this mental experiment,
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   let's say I had 100 different exciting and new experiences.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.120]   I would, at the end of that year,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.900]   feel as if I lived there a certain period of time, one year.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.560]   I would actually know I lived there one year.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.540]   If, however, I lived in three different places
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.260]   in New York City and I met three times as many people
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.240]   and I had three times as many novel experiences,
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.800]   I would actually feel as if I had been there much longer
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.980]   than had I only lived in one location.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.580]   This is also true for social interactions.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:09.580]   When we move to multiple or several novel environments
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.160]   with somebody else,
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.480]   we tend to feel as if we know that person much better
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.880]   and that they know us much better.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.140]   Now, of course, we get the opportunity
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.180]   to interact with those people in different contexts
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.140]   and so indeed we do get the opportunity to see them,
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.100]   for instance, at the coffee shop, how they order coffee,
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.140]   you may be at the go to a sports event,
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.100]   how they act there, maybe how they interact with your family.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.040]   You're getting a sense of them in different contexts.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.680]   That's certainly playing a role,
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.760]   but it seems as if the more novelty you experience
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.040]   with somebody, not only the more familiar they are to you,
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.420]   but the more time you feel you've spent with them,
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.020]   even though the total amount of time
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.500]   can be exactly the same.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.620]   And so that's a very interesting aspect
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.180]   of how our perception of time and these neuromodulators
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.000]   and novelty can shape the way,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.900]   not just that we perceive a given event in our world,
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.940]   but how we relate to a place or relate to a person.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.840]   So we've talked a lot about the different neurochemicals
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.000]   and how those neurochemicals
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.020]   can influence our perception of time.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.120]   We haven't talked a lot about the neural circuits
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.220]   and the various areas of the brain that underlie this.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.320]   I do want to touch on that
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.300]   by highlighting a really wonderful study.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.940]   This was a study published in Neuron,
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.420]   also a cell press journal, excellent journal.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.400]   The title of the paper is Behavioral, Physiological,
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.780]   and Neural Signatures of Surprise
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.020]   During Naturalistic Sports Viewing.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.100]   This experiment is really cool.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.300]   They did brain imaging on individuals
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.820]   who are watching basketball games.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.460]   These were basketball games that actually took place,
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.800]   that were recorded.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.440]   And the subjects watching these basketball games,
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.060]   in some cases, not all,
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.100]   had some interest in who would win or lose.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.780]   And in some cases, not all,
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.760]   the subjects in these studies had some prior knowledge
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.780]   of which team they thought was better,
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.280]   which team was likely to win or not likely to win.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.980]   The basic findings of the study
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:00.120]   were that they could measure surprise
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.400]   by the release of dopamine in two areas of the brain,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.440]   part of what is called, excuse me,
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.300]   the mesolimbic reward pathway.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.860]   So the two areas of the brain that are important here
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.340]   are the nucleus accumbens and the VTA,
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.580]   the ventral tegmental area.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.500]   These are areas that release dopamine
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.320]   as kind of a token of reward
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.620]   any time something is surprising
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.220]   or a positive expectation is met, okay?
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.600]   So if I predict that my team dribbling down court
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.380]   is going to score on this drive
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.940]   and they get the ball in the basket,
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.260]   a little bit of dopamine is released.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:37.080]   These two brain areas light up in the functional imaging,
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.260]   so-called fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.660]   that they used in the study.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.860]   What's really interesting about this study
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.820]   is not just that dopamine was released
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.060]   anytime that something the subject wanted to see happened,
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.740]   anytime they wanted to see their team score, they scored,
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.620]   but also during surprise.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.740]   So if they thought, for instance,
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.060]   and they would hit a button to predict
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.380]   that their team was going to score on this particular drive
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.660]   and they didn't,
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.120]   well, then dopamine could also be released
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.020]   in response to that surprise.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.740]   So this speaks again to dopamine
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.180]   being something that's important,
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:16.060]   not just for positive events, but for unexpected events.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.100]   Now, that's all very interesting
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.740]   and speaks to the fact that dopamine
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.420]   is a kind of flexible currency in the brain.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.540]   It's doled out, if you will, or released
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.060]   when something that one hopes will happen happens,
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.860]   and it's released when there's a surprise,
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.980]   even if it's kind of a negative surprise,
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.220]   it's not something that the subject wanted to happen.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.060]   But the more interesting thing
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.200]   is how that relates to time perception.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.740]   What they found was,
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.500]   regardless of what caused the dopamine release,
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.340]   the frequency of dopamine release
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:53.460]   predicted how the subjects parsed the time bins
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.700]   of the game they were watching.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.660]   What do I mean by that?
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.340]   Well, when you watch a basketball game
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.420]   or you watch anything, children playing
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.780]   or talking to your spouse or whatever,
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.740]   you're batching time.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.500]   How are you batching time?
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.580]   Well, you could batch a meal by the, I don't know,
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.200]   the appetizer, the main course, and the dessert,
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.640]   but it turns out that's not what you're doing.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.860]   You're batching time according to the frequency
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:21.220]   of dopamine pulses, the frequency of dopamine release.
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.000]   And that's what they saw in this study.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.220]   If they evaluated people's perceptions
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.520]   of the passage of time,
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.260]   what they found is that that matched,
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.920]   not whether or not it was a particular time point
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.880]   in the game, not whether or not their team
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.140]   was going down court or running back up court
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.680]   to play defense,
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.340]   but the dopamine release served as markers
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.220]   which would predict the frame rate
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.960]   of their perception of the experience.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.400]   And if that sounds complicated,
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.860]   what I mean is how often and when you release dopamine
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.100]   is actually setting the frame rate
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.780]   on the entire perception of everything,
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.740]   not just for positive events or negative events.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.380]   So what this means is as you were going through life,
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:06.260]   dopamine and the release of dopamine is saying,
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.120]   that's over and now you're in a new phase of your life,
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.580]   even if it's very short, right?
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.900]   So if I get up in the morning and I really need
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.980]   a cup of coffee, as you probably all know,
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.980]   I wait 90 minutes to 120 minutes before I drink my coffee,
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.940]   but then I get my coffee
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.940]   and surely there's a dopamine hit there, I promise you.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.900]   I actually am starting to carve up my day
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.520]   according to dopamine hits.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.700]   I am with consciously or subconsciously,
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.380]   I'm actually carving up my experience according
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.820]   to when I'm getting dopamine throughout my day.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.420]   This governance over our perception of time
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:47.040]   that dopamine has points to a very clear,
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.500]   very actionable and very powerful tool.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.540]   And that is a tool that many people have talked
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.660]   about before, which are habits.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:58.700]   People have discussed habits in a variety of contexts,
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:03.620]   but in the context of dopamine reward
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:07.600]   and time perception, what this means is that placing
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:12.600]   specific habitual routines at particular intervals
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.900]   throughout your day is a very, not just convenient,
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.940]   but a very good way to incorporate the dopamine system
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.300]   so that you divide your day into a series
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.100]   of what I would call functional units.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.180]   What would this look like?
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.520]   It would mean waking up and having one specific habit
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.520]   that you always engage in that causes a release of dopamine.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.920]   You could say, well, great, that'll make me feel good.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.080]   And I would agree, dopamine release generally makes us
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.960]   feel motivated, but it would have an additional effect
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.380]   of marking that time of day as the beginning
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.940]   of a particular time bin.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.960]   Then inserting another habit, perhaps the beginning of,
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.020]   I don't know, your breakfast or something,
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.760]   but recognizing that that's a habit
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.000]   and being fairly habitual.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.060]   You don't have to be obsessively precise about the timing,
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.460]   but that regular sequencing of things
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.060]   is going to lead not just to dopamine release
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.980]   as it relates to reward and motivation and feeling good,
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.880]   but it actually becomes the way in which we carve up
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.260]   our entire experience of our day.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.820]   And this is almost a circular argument.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.760]   You could say, well, of course, I do one thing,
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.380]   then I do the next, then I do the next,
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.660]   and that's how I perceive my day.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.200]   That's my day, it's my list, it's my to-do list, et cetera.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.020]   But what I'm saying is that on the basis of this study,
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.180]   I should mention the first author,
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.020]   his last name is Antony, it was Antony et al.,
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:39.020]   it was published in 2020, the study on basketball viewing,
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.780]   what it points to is that by engaging in specific habits
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.040]   that we know we can perform well,
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.300]   we are actually setting the frame rate on our day.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.560]   And so I think there will soon come a time
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.680]   where human beings are not just thinking of,
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.620]   okay, my morning routine and my afternoon routine,
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.180]   I think that can be useful.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.660]   And in fact, I used or mentioned a structure
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.520]   of that sort earlier in their episode,
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.900]   but rather thinking about what's actually going on
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.220]   at the level of our biology,
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.860]   which is that dopamine is marking time.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.740]   Habits are a very clear way
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.180]   in which we can invoke dopamine release
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.420]   and therefore provide time markers.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.780]   And what this means is that, for instance,
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.100]   during your morning, you might insert habit one
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:25.140]   and habit two at say, I don't know, 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.,
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.780]   and in doing that, that marks an epoch,
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.620]   a little batch of time in your morning routine
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.500]   that's distinct from the second half of your morning.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:38.620]   In other words, habits serve as flankers or markers
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.860]   for the passage of your day.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.720]   Now, if that seems kind of hyper neurotic
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.980]   or why would I want to structure my life like that,
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.540]   I would say that many people would do well
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.380]   to structure their life like that and to utilize habits,
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.800]   not just for sake of what you do during the habit,
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.100]   but because of the fact that the habits serve as a marker
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.940]   because of the way they can evoke dopamine release.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.500]   And in doing that, you're able to segment your day
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.300]   into a bunch of smaller, if you want them to be smaller,
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.380]   or larger functional units.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.860]   If anyone wants to experiment with this,
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.840]   the Huberman Lab podcast puts out a newsletter.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.380]   It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.460]   You can sign up for it at hubermanlab.com.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.460]   We put it out each month.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.020]   You can see the previous newsletters.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:20.960]   They're zero cost.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.360]   We have our privacy statement there.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.080]   We don't share your email or anything.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.080]   And there you'll find the 12 Steps to Improving Sleep
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.040]   was the first one.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.680]   There's another, the second newsletter
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.080]   was all about neuroplasticity
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.840]   and using scientific literature
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.320]   to improve learning and teaching.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.000]   And in the next newsletter,
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.760]   I intend to include a example protocol
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.280]   of how one could use habits
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.960]   and the relationship between habits and dopamine,
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.640]   dopamine and time perception to structure your day
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.060]   according to performance of particular types of tasks.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.200]   Today, we covered a lot about time perception.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.340]   We certainly didn't cover everything about time perception,
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.920]   but we covered things like entrainment,
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.160]   the role of dopamine, habits, and various routines
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.400]   that can adjust your sense of time
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.400]   for sake of particular goals.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.440]   If you're interested in learning more about time perception,
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.880]   I'd like to point you to a really excellent book
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.760]   called "Your Brain is a Time Machine,
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:15.280]   "the Neuroscience and Physics of Time."
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.080]   The book was written by Professor Dr. Dean Buonamono,
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.480]   who's a professor at UCLA
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.440]   and a world expert in the neuroscience and physics of time.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.580]   I do hope to get Dean on the podcast
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.400]   in the not too distant future.

[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.400]   I cover recent papers,
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.220]   many of which are not included on the podcast.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.500]   We also have a Patreon.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.680]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.080]   at any level that you like.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.320]   Not so much today, but on many previous episodes
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.020]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.920]   And while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.200]   many people derive great benefit from supplements
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.840]   for sleep, for focus, and so forth.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.240]   One issue with supplements, however,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.120]   is that what's listed on the bottle of various supplements
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.120]   isn't always what's included in the bottle.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.720]   And the quality of ingredients varies tremendously
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.000]   across different supplement manufacturers.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.240]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne,
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.880]   that's T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.060]   because Thorne supplements have the highest levels
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.240]   of stringency of any supplement company out there
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.360]   that we are aware of.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.500]   They work with all the major sports teams,
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.620]   they work with the Mayo Clinic,
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.360]   and so we're delighted that we partnered with them.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.260]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.140]   to see the supplements that I take,
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.880]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.220]   If you enter the Thorne site through that portal,
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.920]   you can also get 20% off any of the supplements
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.160]   that Thorne makes.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.160]   Thank you for your time and attention today.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.340]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.300]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.460]   (upbeat music)
