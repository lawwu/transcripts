[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.280]   .
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.400]   Hello, everyone.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.000]   Welcome to our talk on building AI first companies.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.120]   I'm Rossella.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.240]   And I'm Debsha.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.520]   We are so excited to be here with all of you today.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.920]   You've probably heard the term AI first a gazillion times already,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.960]   this week.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.120]   And if you are in this room, chances are you're not just wondering what that means.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.800]   You're also trying to figure out how to actually make it real inside your own company.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   And that's what today's talk is about.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.000]   We wish we could stand here and give you the talk.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.720]   The one with all the answers and a crystal clear playbook for becoming an AI first company.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.640]   But the truth is that that talk probably doesn't exist.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.440]   AI transformation is really hard.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.320]   It's messy.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.440]   It's full of trade-offs and it looks different for every company.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.720]   At Sprout Social, we are in the messy middle of our own AI transformation.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:23.200]   So this talk is a candid real-time look at what it takes to lead a SaaS company into the AI era.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:36.160]   We'll share what's working, what's not, and a practical framework to guide you through your own AI transformation.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.680]   But first, let's break down the buzzword.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.000]   What does AI first even mean?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   I feel like AI first is like teenage sex.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.480]   Everyone talks about it.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.160]   No one really knows how to do it.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.040]   Everyone thinks everyone else is doing it.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.200]   So everyone claims they're doing it.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.360]   Jokes aside, what does it mean to be AI first?
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.480]   It's about evolving from AI features sprinkled into the product to rethinking how you plan,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.800]   build, and deliver value all through an AI lens.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.200]   More than that, it's about putting AI at the center of your strategy.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.400]   But most importantly, it's a mindset shift more than anything else.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.160]   Now, if you've been in tech for a while, you've seen big shifts before.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   Cloud first, mobile first, DevOps, and many more.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.080]   But here's the difference.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   Those shifts disrupted one area at a time.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.960]   AI is distracting all of them at once.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   It's product, it's architecture, it's people, it's process, it's ethics, it's everything.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.840]   And that's what makes it so hard, but also such a game changer.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.160]   Here's the good news.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.280]   Being AI first isn't binary.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   It's not like flipping a switch.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.640]   It's not about throwing everything out and rebuilding your company overnight.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.480]   AI transformation is a multi-dimensional journey.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   It's an evolution.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.200]   Where you are on this spectrum will vary depending on your own company.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.320]   But the important thing is to know where you are and to move with purpose.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.960]   AI transformation is complex, but it doesn't have to feel chaotic.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.800]   At Sprout Social, we found that it helps to think about it through a simple framework.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.600]   At its core, becoming an AI-first company means evolving across three key dimensions.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.960]   Strategy, what you prioritize and why.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.520]   Ways of working, how you build, ship, and adapt.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.040]   And people, how your teams evolve, and the skills that define success.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:09.280]   Whether you're just getting started or already in the thick of it, these three areas give you a way to make sense of the work that is ahead of you.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.560]   And we hope that this simple framework can help you navigate your own AI transformation.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   So, now that we set the bigger picture, let's start with the first dimension, strategy.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.440]   The very first critical shift is about how to determine what to build.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:38.720]   about evolving from an AI-enhanced to an AI-first strategy, where you are reimagining what's possible today thanks to AI.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:47.120]   In the past, investing in AI meant asking, where can we add intelligence to an existing experience?
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   It was about sprinkling AI across your product to make workflows better.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.520]   In contrast, in an AI-first company, the question becomes, what new experiences can we deliver that weren't even possible before?
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.560]   Being AI-first means reimagining what's possible.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.160]   It's about solving problems that were previously unsolvable in ways that customers may not even imagine.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.480]   Now, dreaming about the future is super fun.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.920]   But the challenge is that you still have to ship features to meet your customer needs today.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.000]   That's the tension every company is facing right now.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.960]   How do you ship what customer needs today while also investing in the future you know is coming?
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.440]   If you over-index on the present, you risk falling behind and missing the moment.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:55.120]   If you focus only on the future, you risk disappointing customers, slowing revenue, and potentially starving innovation of resources.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.240]   That's the core of the innovator's dilemma.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.200]   And AI makes it 10 times harder.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.960]   You basically need the discipline of an enterprise and the curiosity and nimbleness of a startup.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.560]   But you need both to be running in parallel.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.880]   It's like steering a ship and launching a rocket at the same time.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.240]   So at some point, you have to figure out how to build a startup inside your own company.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.320]   I couldn't agree more.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.200]   And that is what makes this so difficult.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.000]   With this fast-evolving goalposts, if you felt this tension, you're not alone.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.200]   When a three-month roadmap starts to feel stale in three weeks, what is possible is constantly evolving.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.280]   How do you adjust that in the roadmap?
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.800]   And because of that, we're realizing that we're moving farther from deterministic roadmaps, where we generally knew what we were building for months in advance.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.960]   We've had to shift our mindset that embraces ambiguity, where learning and discovery are what shaped the path forward.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.400]   Now the destination itself can evolve as we learn more about what's possible.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.120]   And that's how we plan.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.520]   It's also evolved how we design.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.720]   When earlier, we could build AI into features.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:26.000]   In an AI-first interaction, customers expect seamless, intelligent systems that stretch across workflows and even roles.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.600]   Let's think through that with an example.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.920]   Let's talk about Woofwell.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.960]   It's a health tracking app for puppies.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.120]   And here, our customer is Pineapples.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.520]   Pineapples uses Woofwell to track meals, activities, digestive insights.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.120]   Yes, that's a poop log.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.440]   And also track supplement recommendations.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   Each of these features in our company is owned by different teams.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.560]   But in an AI-first world, when Pineapples is engaging with that app in a natural language,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.080]   he's not thinking in features.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.400]   He's expecting a unified value.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.000]   So when Pineapples says, I'm feeling kind of blah, a meal-based response could say, hey,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.520]   maybe because you skipped breakfast.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.400]   A digestive-based response could say, yeah, your poop seems a little off today.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.880]   But both answers are useful, but very narrow.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.160]   Now imagine a unified experience for Pineapples.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.360]   The answer could be, it might be the new kibble.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.040]   Your activity seems to be going down over the days and your poop also seemed to be off today.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.200]   Maybe this new supplement that you're trying, pause it and see how you feel tomorrow.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.000]   That's what AI-first really means.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.040]   Not just smarter features with AI sprinkled in them,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.680]   but the unification to generate a broader value that you unlock incrementally through your roadmap.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   But that has also evolved how we build, which means how we work together, move fast, learn fast,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.640]   and stay aligned through this uncertainty.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.160]   Here's what those shifts look like.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.600]   Historically, innovation often happened in a reactive way.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.440]   Someone had an idea, we tested in isolation, maybe do a spike to see if something worked,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.120]   and then move on to the next big idea.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.720]   It was ad hoc.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.280]   And while it led to moments of inspiration, it rarely became sustained strategic driver.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.640]   In an AI-first world, that kind of fragmented discovery doesn't hold up.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.480]   The landscape is moving so fast, with the stakes so high,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.040]   that we need to treat discovery as repeatable, deliberate process.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.080]   And that's what a ritualized discovery means.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.320]   It means building time into our planning cycles for experimentation, hackathons,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.640]   and learning in various forums and formats that are visible and actionable across the company's strategy.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.480]   As part of ritualized discovery, we've also embraced a mindset of MVPs for learning.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   not just to launch quickly, but to validate direction.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.360]   We assume that not every bet will land.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.880]   Some features won't work the way that we're expecting them to.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   But in this case, failure is a feature, not a bug.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.280]   It's what drives clarity through ambiguity.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.760]   We've also had to rethink what processes are for.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.880]   Many of the processes we've built in the past were designed for predictable,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.600]   linear roadmaps with deterministic risks.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.480]   It was a world where we generally knew what we were building months in advance.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.200]   But in an AI-first world where timelines shift, capabilities are evolving monthly,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.720]   those old processes don't always hold up.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.320]   At the same time, if you introduce too many new processes all at once, it can backfire.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.720]   Instead of helping, they slow us down.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.240]   They become overhead.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.200]   They create drag.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.240]   And a few folks here from Sprout will confirm that in Sprout, we've learned that the hard way.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   That's why we've started treating process as a product.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.520]   We evaluate it against outcomes.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.840]   Does it create clarity of direction?
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.280]   Does it unblock teams?
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.920]   Does it help us make better decisions faster?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.320]   And if the answer is no, we have to read to rate or cut it entirely.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.760]   Process isn't a dirty word.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.680]   When it's purposeful, it gives teams the clarity and flow and becomes a process that accelerates.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.520]   Now, we heard in the amazing keynotes yesterday that execution is the moat.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.680]   Speed is paramount to delivering against the evolving landscape of tech and the customer expectations.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.160]   But if you move fast without clarity of direction, you end up with chaos.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.240]   And if you have clarity of direction with no momentum, you stagnate.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.680]   How do you find that balance?
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.800]   Because in AI world, speed matters, but only when it's paired with direction,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.840]   we've had to move from speed to smart velocity.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   Which means building the muscle to move fast with purpose.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.480]   When we talk about prototyping quickly, building MVPs and speed,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.760]   we're not just saying ship it for the sake of shipping it.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.880]   We're talking about working with clarity, momentum and adaptability.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.000]   Smart velocity is what keeps us grounded and moving all at the same time.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.480]   And now let's talk about the most important piece of it all.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.440]   The people.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.840]   If strategy sets the direction and ways of working determines how we execute,
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.840]   the people are what makes the whole thing real.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.200]   After all, country is strategy for breakfast, right?
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.360]   And here's the truth.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   Becoming an AI-first company isn't just tech transformation.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.160]   It's mainly a cultural transformation.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.240]   And country lives in people, how they think, how they work, how they lead and how they feel.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:50.160]   That means that we need to rethink what great talent looks like in the AI era.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.880]   Not just in your AI team, but across the entire company.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.040]   At Sprout Social, we are seeing two major shifts.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:08.000]   How talent is evolving in this AI area and how to scale AI fluency across the organization.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.440]   So let's start with the first one.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.480]   As the world changes, so do the capabilities that matter most.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.000]   To be clear, the talent that we need today isn't replacing what we had yesterday.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.440]   It's just building on it.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.120]   Until now, what made an AI practitioner great was deep specialization.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:35.920]   Being a generalist or a visionary builder gave you an edge, but for most roles, those skills weren't critical.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.240]   Today, that is changing.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:47.840]   AI depth is still essential, but now being a versatile visionary builder has become critical to success.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.920]   That's why we are investing in T-shaped talent.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:14:00.800]   People with deep expertise who can also stretch wide, prototype quickly, collaborate fluidly across silos,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.600]   and bring end-to-end systems to life.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.000]   It's a bit like Indiana Jones.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.160]   We're not choosing the professor and the adventurer.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.760]   We are combining them, bringing the deep specialization of the scholar into the jungle
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.720]   to uncover unimaginable possibilities.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.480]   And that's why more than ever, we need people who can navigate ambiguity.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.760]   There's no playbook.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.000]   The technology is evolving faster.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.600]   The roadmap keeps shifting.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.480]   That means we need pathfinders.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:42.240]   People who can hold to their deep expertise while forging new ways through shifting terrain.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.640]   And in most cases, the path doesn't even exist.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.280]   So they have to imagine it first.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.840]   And that's where visionary thinking becomes a core skill.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:03.440]   So this shift from shipping what's known to charting what's newly possible is what we believe
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.320]   defines the next generation of AI builders.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.360]   But evolving our builders is only part of the story.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.720]   Becoming AI first isn't just about the few who train models or build agents.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.680]   It's about building fluency across the whole organization.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.440]   You can't go AI first if the rest of the company is still AI last.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.400]   So in an AI first company, everyone touches AI, even if they're not training models or building agents.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:44.560]   From marketers and designers to PM and care agents, we want every team to feel empowered to understand AI
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.760]   and confident enough to build with it.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.880]   And that's why we're investing in our wide AI fluency.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:00.480]   To inspire people of what's possible and to make AI feel usable, safe and real in the context of their day-to-day work.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:07.760]   We're supporting this enablement through things like AI newsletters, podcasts, cross-functional AI show and tell,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.200]   and by empowering teams to use whatever AI tools help them work smarter.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.520]   But fluency isn't enough.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.600]   It has to scale.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:27.120]   To do that, we aim to be the sole service platform to enable product and engineering teams across the organization
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.960]   to prototype and ship AI-powered features without needing deep involvement from the AI team.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.920]   The goal is not to turn everyone into an AI expert.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:45.120]   It is to create a company where AI thinking and exploration is the default, not the exception.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.400]   Sorry.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.200]   Sorry.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.680]   All right.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.200]   Now we've talked about a lot of the things that have changed and I know that's very overwhelming,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.920]   but there are also some things that haven't changed.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.040]   The fundamentals.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.440]   Our best AI features still solve customer problems.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.720]   They're rooted in needs, not the novelty of AI, as long as they're solving customer problems.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.200]   User experience, performance, reliability, trust.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.240]   These are still non-negotiable in the AI-first world.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:28.880]   Human creativity, human judgment, and human care remain central to how we lead, how we make decisions,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.520]   and how we show up for our teams and customers.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.760]   So if you're leading AI transformation in your company, get honest about the trade-offs.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.120]   Invest in people, not just models and agents.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.840]   Kill the roadmap if needed.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.400]   Be bold.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.000]   Learn out loud and ship that weird idea.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.480]   We hope this talk served as the flashlight in the maze.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.880]   And you'll leave knowing that becoming AI-first won't be a linear path and it won't be perfect.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.800]   But the good news is you don't need all the answers to get started.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.760]   You just need the right questions and the conviction to evolve.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.880]   We're going to leave you with this one, with this last reflection.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.360]   The most transformative inventions in human history only became truly revolutionary
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.920]   when they became part of our day-to-day life.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.960]   And we're now standing at the cusp of the next greatest revolution.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   This is a profound privilege and an honor.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.720]   Not only are we witnessing this moment, but we have the opportunity and responsibility to shape it,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   to guide our teams, our companies, and our communities through a transformation that will
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.040]   redefine how we live, how we work, and how we connect.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.800]   This isn't just a technological revolution.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.920]   It's a human one.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.640]   This transformation isn't easy.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:59.600]   It takes time, grit, and the patience to navigate setbacks, doubts, and growing backs.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.320]   In fact, this is how we look like when we started the journey.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.560]   And now, well, let's just say we learned a lot.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:15.520]   So if it feels like a long road ahead, you're not alone.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.640]   But we promise it's totally worth it.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.760]   Thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:28.560]   We'll see you next time.
