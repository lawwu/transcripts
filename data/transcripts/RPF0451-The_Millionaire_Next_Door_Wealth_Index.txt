[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.280]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.080]   the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.240]   skills, insight, and consistent daily encouragement
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.200]   you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400]   while building and working on your plan
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.560]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.360]   fighting the sniffles today.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.520]   So today's show is going to be extremely short
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.160]   and to the point, but I wanna talk with you
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.160]   about the Millionaire Wealth Index.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.800]   I'm drawing this from the well-known book,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.680]   "The Millionaire Next Door" by Tom Stanley
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.280]   and William Danko.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.960]   This seminal work was published about 20 years ago.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.920]   In fact, I just realized that they published
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.120]   a 20th anniversary edition, which I have not yet gotten,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.640]   which I need to look up and get a copy
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.760]   of the 20th anniversary edition
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.240]   to see how they've updated that since the passing
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.520]   of Dr. Tom Stanley back in 2015.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880]   Interested to see how they've updated the research,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.200]   interested to see if there have been any changes
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.320]   that have occurred since then.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200]   In the beginning of "The Millionaire Next Door,"
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.180]   the authors talk about how to define the wealthy.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.320]   After all, they're writing a book about the wealthy.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.600]   The subtitle of the book is called
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.280]   "The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy,"
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.080]   and they talk about some different ways
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.920]   to discuss and to categorize wealth.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.740]   This is not actually an easy question to answer.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.360]   Words have meanings depending on where we are.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.840]   We ascribe the meaning to a word
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.940]   based upon our own personal experience,
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.920]   our own personal knowledge,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.440]   and our own personal use of the word.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.600]   I do this every day.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.440]   In my little intro there that you just heard
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.160]   where I said, "Show dedicated to helping you
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.040]   "to live a rich life now
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.820]   "while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.320]   "in 10 years or less,"
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.680]   depending on how you're stumbling into that slogan,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560]   you'll interpret that differently.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.040]   For example, I personally live a very rich life now,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.820]   and I want you to live a rich life now.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.880]   But some people define that term rich
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.560]   in the context of driving a luxury automobile.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.520]   I place a lot more emphasis
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   on having an intellectually rich life
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   than I do on driving a luxury automobile.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.960]   I place a lot more emphasis
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.360]   on having freedom and control over my time
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.900]   than I do on having a luxury timepiece on my wrist.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.640]   Of course, your mileage may vary,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.740]   but that's the definition that I've chosen
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.620]   for living a rich life now.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.940]   Similar things with financial freedom.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.360]   When I talk about financial freedom,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.120]   as I've made clear in previous shows,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.640]   that word can be applied in various ways.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.440]   I consider somebody who is not overwhelmed with debt,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   who has more income than they do expenses
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   to be financially free.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400]   I also consider somebody who's financially independent,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.320]   meaning able to live on the income
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.440]   from their investment portfolio, to be financially free.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.680]   Some people can be financially free on $20,000 a year,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.560]   and some people cannot be financially free on $200,000 a year.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.280]   And so we face the same problem with the word wealth.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.320]   Different people define wealth,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.560]   or the state of being wealthy, differently.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.020]   Some people think about having a lot of stuff,
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.720]   a lot of material possessions,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.800]   and having a lot of luxury items.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.700]   However, that definition can be misleading.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.040]   And in the book "The Millionaire Next Door,"
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.840]   the authors don't talk about wealth or affluence
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.360]   in terms of material possessions.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   One major reason for this is sometimes
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.280]   there can be a positive relationship
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.680]   between wealth and material possessions.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.960]   Somebody who has a lot of material possessions,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.040]   especially even including luxury material possessions,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.560]   might indeed be extremely wealthy.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.600]   But sometimes there can also be an inverse,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.760]   negative relationship between wealth
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.040]   and material possessions.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.120]   After all, it's possible that somebody
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.520]   has spent all their money buying material possessions,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.240]   and thus they don't have any other forms
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.620]   or sources of wealth.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.680]   So how do you get a little closer?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.080]   Net worth should certainly be a factor.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.480]   Net worth, meaning the value of somebody's assets,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.120]   minus their liabilities,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.200]   that number could be high or could be low.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   And you could have a high net worth
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.280]   and a lot of material possessions,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.760]   or you could have a high net worth
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.480]   without a lot of material possessions.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.440]   So net worth is useful.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.480]   And generally, in Tom Stanley's research
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.760]   in "The Millionaire Next Door,"
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.920]   they discussed net worth in the context of
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.080]   usually most of their profiles and research respondents
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.480]   had a net worth an average of between one and $10 million.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.280]   Of course, these numbers were published in 1998.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.680]   And in 1998, if you had a net worth of a million dollars,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.800]   although it wasn't worth as much as it was in 1978,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.040]   in today's dollars, in 2017, as I record this,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   you would have to accumulate $1,496,788.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.800]   So let's just call that $1.5 million among friends
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   to have the same amount of buying power as you had in 1998.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.000]   So here we are coming up on the 20th anniversary
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.280]   of this book, and we would need to adjust this.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.720]   The respondent who was worth a million dollars
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.600]   would need to be worth now in today's dollars, $1.5 million.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.400]   That is a useful consideration.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   The actual nominal or stated dollar value is valuable
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.660]   and is worth considering.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.280]   But that doesn't take into account
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.400]   two important characteristics
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.560]   or two important pieces of data,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   namely, how long have you had to build wealth?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.120]   We would define that in age or possibly number of years
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.280]   working and accumulating money.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.400]   And how much income have you had to work with?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.100]   Somebody who has turned a $50,000 annual income
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.680]   into a $1 million net worth
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.020]   has been a much better saver, investor,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.940]   and manager of wealth
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.620]   than somebody who has turned a $500,000 income
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.460]   into a $1 million net worth, given similar amounts of time.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.720]   In order to factor all these things together,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.780]   the authors came up with a simple formula
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.700]   to calculate how much wealth they said you should have.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.380]   And I think this is a very valuable formula.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.700]   I don't know whether it's particularly valuable
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.180]   still in the context of calculating
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.020]   anything across populations.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.900]   I don't know the usefulness of this.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.460]   But I do think it's a useful consideration
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.000]   for us to know for ourselves.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.620]   And I also think it's valuable to look at the factors
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.680]   that are involved in this wealth index.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.100]   Here's the formula.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.420]   The authors say that the formula is to multiply your age
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.380]   times your realized pre-tax annual household income
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.840]   from all sources except inheritances and divide by 10.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.760]   This, less any inherited wealth,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.620]   is what your net worth should be.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.500]   Now, let me simplify that to make it a little bit
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.980]   more easily grasped in an audio format.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.780]   Take your age, multiply it by your income, divide by 10,
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.380]   and that's what your net worth should be.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.060]   So if you are 40 years old
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.940]   and you have an annual income of $50,000 per year,
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.500]   multiply those together and you come up
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.820]   with a number of $2 million.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.500]   Divide that number by 10
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.420]   and you wind up with a number of $200,000.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.060]   And your net worth should be about $200,000
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.540]   if you're about normal or average.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.840]   And by that I mean normal or average as a wealth builder.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.500]   I don't know, again, any comparison here
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.260]   to the average population.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.380]   But you're listening to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.980]   you're not the average population,
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.860]   and averages don't particularly matter.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.100]   They might be useful for sociologists to study
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.340]   or economists to study,
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.180]   but they don't make much of a difference
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.940]   in your life or in my life.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.380]   It's a funny anecdote,
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.620]   but I always think of this when I think of averages.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.420]   Somebody made the quip somewhere that
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.140]   if you take one bucket of water
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.780]   and you fill it up with boiling water,
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.560]   and you take another bucket of water
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.700]   and you fill it up with ice water,
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.940]   on the whole, on the average, you'll be pretty miserable.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.220]   And the point was, yes, if you put the hot water
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   and the cold water together, on average,
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.820]   the temperature should be comfortable,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.420]   but in your case, you're miserable,
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.820]   depending on where you are
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.460]   and which foot you happen to have in which bucket.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.540]   So I don't know what that means.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.660]   I just think it's always funny
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.300]   that averages are useful to be aware of,
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.740]   but they're not useful for running your life.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.980]   In order to think about the next category,
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.760]   which the authors, and before I go on,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.180]   I encourage you, take a moment,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.780]   and you can do this in your own mind.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.800]   Take your current age, measured in years,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.300]   multiply it by your current income.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.100]   Just round it off.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.340]   So age times income, and think what that number is.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.580]   And then divide by 10, and the simplest way to do that
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.700]   is just move your decimal point one place to the left.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.880]   So again, 40 years old, $100,000 of income.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.140]   In that situation, you would have,
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.980]   the number would be $4 million.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.580]   Move the decimal point one place to the left,
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.860]   and you would now have an expected net worth of $400,000.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.580]   Now, from here, though,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.440]   we should add a little bit of texture.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.580]   The authors use two categories in "The Millionaire Next Door."
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.820]   One is a PAW,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.320]   which is an acronym for prodigious accumulator of wealth.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.620]   A PAW is a prodigious accumulator of wealth.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.620]   Also, a UAW, or an under accumulator of wealth.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.780]   And of course, if you desire to be profiled
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.780]   as being wealthy, then you would want to be in the PAW,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.340]   the prodigious accumulator of wealth category.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.980]   In order to be well-positioned as,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.180]   and characterized as a PAW,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.220]   the authors state that you should be worth twice
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.540]   the level of wealth expected.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.100]   If you are 40 years old, earning $100,000 per year,
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.980]   and you want to know, am I doing really well?
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.180]   Am I in the top quartile?
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.620]   Am I a prodigious accumulator of wealth?
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.220]   Well, in that case, your expected net worth of $400,000,
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.000]   you would like to be able to see that about double, $800,000.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.560]   So these numbers might be able to give you a sense
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.860]   of how you're doing.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.220]   If you're younger, for example, if you're 30 years old,
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.980]   and you have an annual income of $50,000,
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.860]   and you apply this formula,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.300]   well, your expected level of wealth is $150,000.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.260]   If you've accumulated half a million dollars in savings,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.820]   or $300,000, and 150 in your 401k,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.140]   and $100,000 of equity in your house,
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.740]   and $50,000 of savings, you're doing really, really well.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.700]   You're on track.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.620]   And so there are a few reasons I want to profile
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.320]   this formula for you.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.860]   Number one, I want to encourage you
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.820]   that either you're on track,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.760]   or you might want to adjust things a little bit.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.780]   The reason it's important to recognize you're on track
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.340]   is you have to go with,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.420]   you have to look and compare yourself
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.980]   to people who are in a similar situation as you.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.620]   And this is why I want to break this down.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.400]   The two big factors are your age and your income.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.800]   Don't, if you're 30 years old,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.500]   don't compare yourself and your level of wealth
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.100]   to somebody who is 50 years old.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.500]   Compare yourself to other 30 year olds,
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.480]   because in general, you're going to have started working
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   at a different time than they did,
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.080]   and you've got to compare yourself to a similar category.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.480]   Likewise, if you're earning a very high income,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.040]   don't compare yourself to people
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.680]   who are earning a low income and think,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.120]   oh, look, I'm doing great.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.980]   Compare yourself to people who are also earning
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.840]   a high income, who are good producers of income.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.760]   Compare yourself to these peers.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.880]   In order to do that,
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.600]   you're going to have to find some kind of formula,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.200]   because it's going to be hard for you to find similar peers
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.840]   who are at similar amounts of age and similar income.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.400]   I think the use of something like a wealth index
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.360]   is a valuable and useful way for you
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.280]   to get a sense of how you're doing.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.800]   Couple of caveats.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.560]   If you are very young, don't look to this
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.960]   as a source of authority.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.080]   Whether you're very young because you are very young
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.440]   in terms of your actual age,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.160]   if you're 20 years old or 25 years old or 30 years old,
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   or if you're very young in terms of the amount
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.160]   of the number of years that you have been working,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.440]   you cannot look to a formula like this.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.480]   The most extreme example would be somebody
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   like a recent doctor, a recent graduate from medical school,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.440]   or some highly trained, highly specialized occupation.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.920]   A recent graduate from a medical school
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.280]   may be half a million dollars in the hole.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.760]   Their net worth may be minus $500,000,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.520]   and they have gotten out of school in their early
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.600]   or going on mid 30s, and they have no wealth accumulated yet.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.920]   That doesn't mean that you are,
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.440]   that doesn't mean that you're necessarily inefficient.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.020]   Stanley, in one of his blog posts on this topic,
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.360]   later wrote and recommended to his readers
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.960]   that they adjust their age and pull out all the years
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.040]   that they've been in school
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.440]   as a way of adjusting the formula.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.600]   You will be extremely wealthy,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.120]   and this formula will be very helpful for you
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.080]   when you reach about, say, 45 or 50 years old.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.520]   But when you're just getting out of school,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.580]   or if you're very young, these results,
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.920]   the results of this wealth index
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.240]   are not particularly useful to you.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.280]   One other point on this topic that I want to emphasize
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.100]   of how you can game the formula.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.140]   It's always good to look at something and see,
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.080]   how could I manipulate this if I were going to manipulate it?
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.400]   And I want to point out the huge possible point
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.880]   of manipulation in this formula,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.240]   which is something that you should manipulate
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.880]   because, as is written later in the book,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.660]   this is what the wealthy manipulate.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.940]   I read verbatim.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.940]   Multiply your age times your realized pre-tax annual
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   household income from all sources except inheritances.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.520]   Divide by 10.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.480]   This less any inherited wealth
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.120]   is what your net worth should be.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.460]   Do you catch one of the biggest factors
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.420]   that you can manipulate?
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.720]   You can't manipulate your age.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.940]   But what can you manipulate?
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.520]   I read again with emphasis.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   Multiply your age times your realized pre-tax annual
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   household income from all sources except inheritances.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:29.900]   The key way to game a formula like this,
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.940]   and in this context, gaming is a good thing
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.080]   because it means you're going to be
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.660]   a much more efficient accumulator of wealth,
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   is to play with that word realized.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.200]   Now, in tax lingo, what realized means
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.520]   is money that you've actually received.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.600]   You would talk about this in the context of real income.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.220]   Real income is money that you've actually received
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.800]   as compared to phantom income,
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   which is income that you pay tax on,
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.560]   but you don't actually receive.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.440]   Examples of phantom income would be things
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   like zero coupon bonds, where you are accruing interest,
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.800]   but you're not, which you're paying tax on the interest,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.440]   but you're not actually receiving any money
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.480]   because you'll receive the interest
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.800]   that's being assigned to you
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.120]   when you actually sell the bond.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Or another example of phantom income would be
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.240]   when you have a debt that is forgiven by a creditor.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.520]   If you have a creditor that forgives you a $10,000 loan,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.680]   you are going to incur $10,000 of income,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.400]   and you're gonna owe the tax on it
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.680]   so you could save your effective tax rate, or 20%.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.320]   You would owe $2,000 of taxes on that money,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   which the IRS will collect on,
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.560]   but you never actually realized any income.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.000]   That's called phantom income.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   So that's what realized and unrealized income is.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.600]   The other word that is important is recognized income,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.880]   meaning when do you actually recognize a gain or a loss?
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.720]   Sometimes with certain types of income
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.160]   or certain types of losses,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.060]   you can choose to recognize them at different times.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.960]   The point is the lower your realized income,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.240]   the lower your expected net worth.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.920]   And so what the wealthy people generally will want to do
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.360]   is to lower their realized income
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.960]   and to keep the money efficiently invested.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.120]   Because if you can lower your realized income,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.280]   you have the opportunity to keep it invested
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.440]   if you control the source of that income.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.320]   If you're just simply offered two job options,
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.960]   job A pays you 50 grand a year,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   and job B pays you 100 grand a year,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.640]   and you have no equity stake whatsoever,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.520]   then in that circumstance,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.240]   you better take the $100,000 a year.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.680]   But if you own the company
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.360]   and you have the choice to either
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.600]   take a job paying $50,000 a year
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.920]   or to take a job paying $100,000 a year,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.360]   and you're 100% shareholder of the company,
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.040]   it's in your best interest, probably,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.880]   as long as the company is doing well,
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.600]   to keep that realized income number as low as possible.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.280]   Yes, that games the formula,
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.240]   but as you read later in the book,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.720]   it's one of the best ways to game the formula
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.760]   because it allows you to keep the money
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   because it allows you to continue investing the money
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.960]   without it getting out into the wild

[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.960]   divide by 10.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.840]   That, less any inherited wealth,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.320]   is what your net worth should be.
