[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.280]   Today we're gonna talk about the pursuit of holiness
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.880]   as justified believers, something we must get right.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.500]   It's basically the question over whether God delights in us
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000]   as justified children.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   Does he delight in us in our imputed righteousness
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   or does he delight in our actual lived out holiness?
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.600]   The question is from Kelly, a listener who lives
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.200]   in the state of Georgia.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.640]   Pastor John, hello, one of the most joy inspiring truths
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.920]   of the gospel is the imputed righteousness of Christ
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.120]   on our account, amen.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.000]   I'm thinking here of 2 Corinthians 5 21.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360]   Is it safe to say then that God is fully pleased with me
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.920]   based on Christ's work alone?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.160]   If so, how do you reconcile this with scriptures
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.240]   such as Colossians 1 10, where Paul encourages us
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.280]   to quote, walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.200]   fully pleasing in his sight, unquote.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.160]   Does God's pleasure in me depend upon Christ's work
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.480]   or my own works or is it somehow both?
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.980]   Can you please explain this dynamic?
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.840]   - This is really crucial.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.680]   It's a question that lies very close to my heart
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680]   because as I look out across the longer term effects
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   of the gospel centered movement of the last 40 years or so,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.760]   one of my concerns is that the stress on justification
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.920]   by faith, which is a glorious doctrine,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.500]   not to be diminished or compromised at all,
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.500]   has not been accompanied by a biblically proportionate
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.340]   focus on sanctification by faith.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.340]   And one form that this neglect has taken
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.720]   is the hesitancy for some pastors to say to their people,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.500]   you should seek to please the Lord by the way you live.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.620]   And one of the reasons they're hesitant to say this
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.500]   is that they think it undermines
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740]   the doctrine of justification,
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.740]   which says that we already stand pleasing or perfect
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.580]   before God clothed with the perfection and the righteousness
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.100]   and the obedience of Christ,
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.140]   which is counted as ours through faith alone.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.140]   So this question is absolutely crucial
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.140]   in order to preach and live biblically
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.980]   because there's no doubt that throughout the gospels
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.020]   and throughout the epistles,
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.060]   we are exhorted to walk, that is live practically
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.060]   with our minds and our attitudes and members of our body.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.820]   We're exhorted to walk in a way that pleases the Lord.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.020]   And you may not please the Lord if you don't walk that way.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.740]   Now that's not a peripheral teaching
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.260]   and it's not in conflict with justification by faith.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.380]   So let me give some biblical foundation
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.940]   for each of those realities,
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.980]   namely justification is the imputation
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.180]   of Christ's obedience to us
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.180]   and sanctification as a way of life that pleases the Lord.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.500]   And then, and I'll try to put them together.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.180]   Second Corinthians 5, 21,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.180]   for our sake, God made Christ to be sin who knew no sin
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.180]   so that in him, we might become the righteousness of God
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.820]   or Philippians 3, 9,
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.140]   that I may be found in him,
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.140]   not having a righteousness of my own that comes from law,
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.580]   but that which comes through faith in Christ,
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.580]   the righteousness from God that depends on faith
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.580]   or Romans 5, 19, as by one man's,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.020]   namely Adam's disobedience,
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.380]   the many were appointed sinners.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.180]   So by one man's, namely Christ's obedience,
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.780]   the many will be appointed righteous.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.140]   We call this appointing imputation
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.780]   or being counted righteous.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.740]   And this imputation happens by union with Christ
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.860]   through faith, not works, Romans 4, 5.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.260]   And to the one who does not work,
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.820]   but believes in him who justifies the ungodly,
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.700]   his faith is counted as righteousness.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.180]   So the moment, and this is the glory,
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.180]   the moment we experience authentic faith in Christ
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.660]   and are thus united to him,
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.660]   at that moment, his death counts as the punishment
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.020]   of all our sin so that all divine wrath
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.020]   is forever removed from us.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.180]   And in that same glorious moment,
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.180]   Christ's entire obedience is counted as ours
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.420]   so that he fulfills for us every demand
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.700]   that the law made on us
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.060]   in order to be found in God's everlasting favor.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.840]   From that moment on, for the rest of eternity,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   God is 100% for us,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.780]   not 99% for us and a little bit against us,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.340]   100% for us, for us.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.340]   That's the glory of justification by faith.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.340]   Now, the fact that God reckons us to be perfect in Christ
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.440]   and thus acceptable to him in his holiness
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.780]   does not mean that God is willing
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.260]   to leave us in a condition,
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.560]   embattled by sin,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.500]   where we can't fully enjoy him forever.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.680]   The fact that God accepts us fully in Christ
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   means he is fully committed to making us fully happy,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   forever, which means that he is displeased with anything
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.540]   short of our joyful perfection
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.100]   in attitude and heart and mind and body,
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.240]   because any imperfection is a dishonor to his worth
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.640]   and a diminishment of our joy.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.340]   God cannot, as a justifying God,
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.340]   be indifferent to our everlasting happiness,
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.700]   which means being indifferent to our everlasting holiness.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.200]   He cannot.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.060]   That's what justification guarantees.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.060]   So we have texts like the one Kelly points out
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.160]   in Colossians 1.10.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.440]   "We pray for you," Paul says,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.800]   "that you may walk," that's live,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.940]   actually live in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.920]   fully pleasing to him.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.800]   That's what Paul's praying for.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.300]   God does not only intend to count us righteous
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.320]   because of Christ, but to make us righteous
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.020]   because of Christ.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.500]   To say that he sees us clothed
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.900]   with the righteousness of Christ
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.700]   for the sake of justification does not mean
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.540]   that he has become blind to the attitudes and thoughts
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.380]   and deeds of our life on earth.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.260]   He has not become blind or indifferent
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.180]   to our lived out holiness.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.420]   On the contrary, it's only because our sins
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.700]   are completely forgiven that we can get any victory
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.660]   over sinning at all.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   Practical holiness is only possible
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.700]   because of the prior imputed holiness.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.460]   God means to get glory for Jesus,
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.400]   not only as the one who deals with the guilt of our sin
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.880]   by justification, but also the one who deals
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   with the power of our sin by sanctification.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   Over and over, Paul tells Christians
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.120]   to make it their aim to please the Lord
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.860]   by the way they walk, that is the way they live.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.860]   1 Thessalonians 4, 1, we urge you to walk
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.220]   and to please God.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.260]   2 Corinthians 5, 9, whether at home or away,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.460]   we make it our aim to please him.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.980]   Colossians 2, 20, children obey your parents in everything
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.820]   for this pleases the Lord.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.620]   1 Timothy 2, 3, I urge that supplications
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.940]   be made for all people.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.580]   This is good and it is pleasing in the sight of God,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.500]   our Savior.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.220]   1 Timothy 5, 4, let them learn to make some return
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.220]   to their parents for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.020]   And the flip side of this repeated refrain
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   that we can and should please the Lord by the way we live
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.580]   is the fact that we can displease the Lord
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.580]   by the way we live, even as justified, accepted, loved,
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.660]   children of God.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.740]   Paul says, do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.280]   Ephesians 4, 30.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.800]   And in 1 Thessalonians 5, 19, he says,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.780]   do not quench the spirit.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.780]   And in Hebrews 12, God disciplines those he loves,
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.020]   his justified children.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.240]   And then he explains what he's doing.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.380]   It says, and this is verse 11 of chapter 12.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:39.060]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.580]   rather than pleasant, but later it yields
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.020]   the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.880]   That's not imputed righteousness.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.420]   That's practical righteousness that happens
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.980]   because God is disciplining us in our need.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.680]   So there is imputed righteousness
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.040]   and there is imparted righteousness.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.760]   The imputed righteousness is the foundation
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.040]   of imparted righteousness.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.600]   The only sin you can get any victory over
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.040]   is a forgiven sin, not the other way around.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.200]   The imputed righteousness is the way
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.160]   we become the children of God
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   so that he now exerts his omnipotent fatherly favor
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:38.540]   to impart his own righteousness to us by the spirit.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.260]   So Kelly asks, does God's pleasure in me
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:50.460]   depend upon Christ's work or my works,
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.220]   or is it somehow both?
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.080]   And here's the way I would answer.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   Proverbs 3.12 says, the Lord reproves him whom he loves
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:11.900]   as a father, the son in whom he, get this word, delights.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.480]   Delights.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.480]   So God is seeking to make us delightful to him
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.940]   in our lived out holiness and happiness
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.940]   because we are delightful to him as his justified children.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.500]   - So important.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.720]   That's a great line here.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.960]   As a justifying God, God cannot be indifferent
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.600]   to our everlasting happiness,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.200]   which means being indifferent to our everlasting holiness.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   Yes and amen.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.760]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.960]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.580]   Search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.720]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   And we have a listener of the podcast
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.680]   who was recently reading Colossians 2.12
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.120]   and he's wondering if faith causes regeneration
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.520]   or is it the other way around?
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.340]   Does regeneration, the new birth, cause faith
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.160]   or does faith cause regeneration?
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.520]   It's a great question.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.280]   It's up next on Monday.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.200]   and we will see you back here after the weekend.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.320]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.900]   (upbeat music)
