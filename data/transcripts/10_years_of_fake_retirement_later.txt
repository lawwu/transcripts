[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.080]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.540]   And in this episode, I want to wish all of you a happy Independence Day, 4th of July.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.280]   And I also want to talk about 10 years of fake retirement later, the most important
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.600]   takeaways that I want to share with all of you.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.920]   So back in February 2012, I decided to negotiate a severance to break free from corporate life.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.760]   I had been working in investment banking for 13 years, and at one firm, my last firm for
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.640]   11 years, and frankly, I was getting sick of it.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.640]   And by mid June 2012, I was able to negotiate a severance package and collect the last of
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.840]   my three months of Warn Act pay.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.000]   Don't confuse Warn Act pay with getting a severance check.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.560]   Warn Act pay is mandatory pay by the company.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.040]   A severance check is voluntary.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.720]   Overall, it's been an incredible journey.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.000]   However, I'm also sad I'll never be able to get those past 10 years back.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.840]   The greater your appreciation of time, the less you will want to waste it.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.640]   So for those of you who want to permanently leave your day job, maybe it's not permanent
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.840]   actually.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.160]   This episode is for you.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.440]   So first of all, why do I use the term fake retirement?
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.880]   It's pretty simple, actually.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.000]   I consider myself a fake retiree because consistently publishing three to four times a week for
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.440]   13 plus years takes a lot of work.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.960]   Even though I enjoy writing, I'm still spending about 14, 15, 16 hours a week creating instead
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960]   of consuming.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.720]   Then I spend another four or five, six hours a week responding to comments and emails and
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.440]   inbound requests.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.820]   So it's really a never ending process.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.120]   And the larger your platform grows, the more inbound requests you'll receive.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   Also, since retiring from a day job in 2012, I did some consulting work part time at several
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.160]   startups for three years.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.680]   These startups range from series seed to series C. And I just wanted to experience startup
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.280]   internet culture here in San Francisco, because I came here in 2001.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.220]   And I thought it would be a crying shame if I didn't experience any of that.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.760]   So I got to experience what it was like to work in a small group, and to try to do a
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.580]   lot of marketing and online acquisitions and so forth.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.520]   But after three years, I said, Okay, I know what I need to know, I've scratched the itch.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.400]   I don't want to do it anymore.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.240]   It's only it was only 15 to 20 hours a week, but it'll still work.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.620]   And the final reason why I use fake retirement is that since 2017, I've been a stay at home
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.260]   dad.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.140]   Despite working in banking for 13 years, 60 plus hours a week, every single week, I think
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.300]   being a stay at home parent to two young children is at least 100% harder.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.060]   You've got to always be on otherwise something bad might happen, something really bad might
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.980]   happen, they could just like fall off an edge, hurt themselves real bad or worse.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.340]   So it's really, it's really stressful being a stay at home parent.
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.400]   I've had many of those heart jumps, those mini heart attacks, because just looking, looking
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.740]   one way, suddenly the kid just disappears.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.260]   And you're like, Oh my gosh, where'd they go?
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260]   And you find them in some precarious situation.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.220]   So it's not easy being a stay at home parent.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.900]   So if you have a stay at home spouse, or you see someone, you know, staying at home for
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.620]   three to six months to take care of their baby.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.780]   It's not a vacation, it really isn't a vacation.
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.180]   Compared to work, the ability to work from home, I think, you know, working from home
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.420]   is kind of a vacation compared to being a stay at home parent now.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.660]   And there's one other reason why I use fake retirement.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.240]   Since the beginning of 2020, I've been writing a new personal finance book, right?
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.240]   Buy this, not that, how to spend your way to wealth and freedom.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.420]   It was also something really difficult to create.
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.580]   And it's not just because writing is hard.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.480]   But it's also because you need to collaborate with many, many minds, from the content editors
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.500]   to the copy editors.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.420]   There are many people trying to create a book and edit a book.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.500]   So it's not easy.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.780]   It's kind of like some say birthing a book baby.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.580]   So fake retiree I am and I'm going to embrace that term in all its glory because the earlier
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.660]   you retire, the sooner you're going to find something you're really passionate about doing
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.220]   and you're going to enjoy doing it because you have the ability to do so.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.700]   So let's talk about the lessons learned after 10 years of fake retirement.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.140]   I've been writing about achieving financial independence since July 2009, when I launched
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.740]   Financial Samurai.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.020]   And since then, the fire movement has become more mainstream.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.420]   Terms such as coast fire, lean fire, barista fire, slow fire, all these different types
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.400]   of flavors of financial independence have popped up to help those still far away from
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.500]   financial independence feel better about their progress.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.100]   And knowing you're making progress is really important when you're trying to achieve financial
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.460]   freedom because you can easily get distracted.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.960]   You can see some shiny object that you want to spend on debt.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.900]   You can see something else that someone else is doing and you want to follow them on their
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.940]   travels and lose discipline in your saving and investing quest to build passive income.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.540]   Achieving financial independence is a long journey.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.380]   Therefore, if you can use these terms to help fit your situation, I think that's great.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.380]   It'll help motivate you to keep on going, to keep on trying.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.280]   When you achieve financial independence or when your investments can generate enough
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.540]   passive investment income to cover at least your basic living expenses, you're going to
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.540]   feel great and you're going to have a tremendous amount of freedom.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.900]   So this brings me to the first lesson I've learned after 10 years of fake retirement.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.380]   And that is only you will know whether you are truly financially independent or not.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.700]   We can come up with these terms to make ourselves feel better about our progress.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.360]   However, deep down, only you know whether you are financially independent or just faking
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   it.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.180]   And faking it is a common thing, right?
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.700]   We try to fake it before we make it.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.620]   But faking it ultimately doesn't work when it comes to living the life you want.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.660]   So really look deep down, crunch the numbers and see whether your finances really are enough
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.720]   or are on track.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.820]   Because at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about your
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.300]   financial situation.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.140]   All that matters is whether you are able to do what you want or not because you are financially
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.700]   independent.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.620]   The second point, and this is the second point out of 11 points.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.380]   Your financial needs and desires will change over time.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.980]   It's really important not to think this is what you're going to need in terms of passive
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.180]   income or net worth because your life will change.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.860]   You will experience all these unexpected things, good and bad unfortunately, that will make
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.780]   you feel different about how much money you need.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.580]   When I left in 2012, I thought $80,000 in passive income, good enough.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.500]   It wasn't an extravagant lifestyle but I could survive in expensive San Francisco.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.340]   And my next goal was to generate $150,000 in passive income by the time my wife left
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.380]   her day job as well at the age of 34 in 2015.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.900]   And so that makes sense, right?
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.700]   Basically double $80,000.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:39.180]   But then in 2017, we had our son and we thought, well, better try to make more money.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.380]   Healthcare costs, the premiums per month were about $2,000.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.760]   And then we looked up the preschool costs were $2,000 to $3,000 a month.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   So we said, okay, $50,000 more.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.820]   So that brings us to $200,000.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.900]   And then at the end of 2019, we were blessed with a daughter.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.060]   So we thought, well, another $50,000 it is then.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.380]   So it just kept on going up.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.060]   It's kind of like inflation.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.540]   It just keeps on going up and you really need to be flexible in how much you need and how
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.160]   much you want.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.300]   Because these are good things that have happened to us.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.780]   And I know eventually, there are going to be bad things that happen to us, accidents,
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.660]   sicknesses, taking care of our parents and our relatives and our friends and so forth.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.660]   So just because you think you'll need X amount of passive income to retire early, doesn't
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.820]   mean that amount will stay static forever.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.180]   And so I highly encourage everyone to start generating supplemental retirement income
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.420]   once your day job is done.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:43.420]   All right, three, you will adopt a dynamic safe withdrawal rate and be more flexible
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.200]   overall.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.480]   Because your financial needs and desires will change over time.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.480]   You should also be flexible with your safe withdrawal rate.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.300]   The best safe withdrawal rate is a dynamic one.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.320]   And that dynamic one I think is based off my formula, the Financial Samurai safe withdrawal
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.900]   rate formula of 80% times the 10 year bond yield.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.100]   Contrary to what academics might say, there is no one fixed safe withdrawal rate to go
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.100]   by.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.860]   I'm a practitioner of early retirement who let go of a day job security in 2012.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.860]   I don't have a salary.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.420]   I don't have a pension waiting for me.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.140]   I just can't pontificate.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.460]   I really need to go through and live this life and figure things out.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.940]   And I'm telling you, folks, you've got to be dynamic in your withdrawal rate and in
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.720]   your thought.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.180]   And one of the reasons why I think the 10 year bond yield is a fantastic barometer because
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:45.940]   it shows us it tells us what the expectations are for inflation, for economic growth, for
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.980]   corporate earnings growth, for unemployment.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.380]   So these are all really important things we need to be aware about while we're trying
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.100]   to build more wealth and while we're trying to decumulate our wealth in retirement.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.060]   Every single economic situation is different.
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.580]   Therefore, you need to be dynamic and flexible.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.020]   Four, you will eventually take your freedom for granted.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.540]   This is kind of sad, isn't it?
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.860]   You take your freedom for granted.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:18.940]   Unfortunately, the hedonic treadmill is the main reason why achieving financial independence
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.300]   won't solve all your problems.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.960]   It does feel amazing to be able to do what you want whenever you want, but it just it
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.540]   just doesn't last sadly.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.780]   I mean, maybe that great feeling might last for about three to six months.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.620]   But after that, you just kind of revert back to your mean.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.180]   For example, while you were working, you might have felt giddy leaving work at 3 p.m. to
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.820]   have a drink with a colleague, thinking to yourself, "Oh, you are getting paid to drink.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.940]   Sweet!"
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.900]   But then once you have total independence, you might actually start getting annoyed meeting
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.900]   up so late.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:59.420]   You'd be like, "Can we just have, you know, happy hour at like one o'clock or 12 while
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.420]   we're eating?"
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.500]   It'd be so much more efficient that way instead of three o'clock.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.140]   Once you leave your day job, you will naturally create your own routine.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.260]   And this routine is just going to replace your old routine.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.620]   And if you have to make commitments outside your normal new routine, you might feel agitated.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.340]   In fact, I know you will.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.420]   All right, fifth point, fifth takeaway, you will likely have a recurring desire to return
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.480]   to work.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.820]   This is a really interesting phenomenon because the longer you do something, the more you're
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.580]   going to miss doing that thing.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.980]   Once you leave your day job, you know, you're going to start second guessing your fake retirement
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.820]   decision, especially if you leave very early on.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.220]   If you don't retire to something purposeful, something you would really enjoy doing, the
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.900]   greater your desire to return to work will be.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.340]   For me, I've battled the urge to return to work at least three times.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.580]   First time in 2012 when I just left work.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:01.500]   I was like, "Oh, is this the right thing to do to give up this multiple six-figure potential
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.500]   job?
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.780]   Hmm, man, I better interview with other competing firms just to make sure I wasn't making a
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.780]   mistake."
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:15.060]   Second time I wanted to return to work, 2018, a year after my son was born.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.460]   I felt I needed to start earning again to better take care of my family.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.300]   Just seemed like that was the responsible thing to do as the father of the household.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.540]   And then after spending so much time taking care of my son at home, I started fantasizing
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.580]   going back to work because I felt maybe it would be like a nice vacation.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:39.860]   You know, you just commute for 15 to 25 minutes, you go to the water cooler and talk to your
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.700]   friends and then you have lunch and then you have happy hour.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.480]   And of course, you do some work in the office, right?
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.140]   But that sounded pretty nice to hang out with a lot of adults again.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:56.540]   And then the final time I wanted to go back to work, not truly wanted to, but I was thinking
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.780]   about it, was a year after the pandemic began because so many people I knew started working
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.780]   from home, right?
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.500]   If you didn't have to commute, that was like my number one PITA for going to work was the
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   commute.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.420]   If you didn't have to commute, that was pretty good.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.220]   If you had a flexible schedule, even better.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.380]   I had so many friends who were able to work from home who were asking me to play tennis
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.860]   with them at 11am, noon and 1pm.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.660]   So I figured, hey, if you can make good money not having to work or not having to work really
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.020]   hard, sign me up.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.380]   So for those of you who have worked from home jobs, definitely appreciate that flexibility
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.140]   because I think it's just wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.140]   You know what?
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.060]   Maybe it is a grass is greener syndrome because I do have friends who work from home and they
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.340]   say they can't even go to the bathroom or they're scheduling a bathroom break because
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.380]   they have so many back to back video calls.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.780]   So that doesn't seem fun.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.180]   All right, six, you appreciate time more, not less.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.940]   You would think having more time would make you become less appreciative of time.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:11.480]   After all, increased supply generally leads to a decline in prices, a decline in appreciation.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.220]   But the opposite is true.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.700]   Because when you can do whatever you want, you're no longer forced to do things you absolutely
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.260]   don't want to do.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.820]   Therefore, every minute that is wasted has a greater opportunity cost.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:30.220]   For example, when I was working, clients would show up late all the time to meetings.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.980]   But I didn't really care because they were the client and I had nowhere else to go.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.740]   I was on the job.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:43.060]   But if someone shows up 30 minutes late today, I'm going to be really, really agitated because
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:48.220]   I could have spent that time playing with my daughter, writing on Financial Samurai,
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.460]   playing tennis or my favorite activity in the afternoon, napping.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.740]   When you're able to optimize your time by only doing what you want, spending your time
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.420]   sub optimally starts to feel pretty bad.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:08.560]   All right, seven, you realize how strange it is to take instruction from other adults
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.420]   all day long.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.740]   The longer I'm away from work, the more peculiar I think it is that over a billion people voluntarily
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.640]   listen to other adults for 40 plus hours a week.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.500]   And then once the work hours are done, we're all equal outside of work.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.060]   And maybe this is confidence speaking, because, you know, we're spending a lot of hours, at
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.460]   least before in the office, you know, kowtowing to our superiors and our seniors.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.720]   And it's just the way things are.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.300]   But you know, when you don't have to do that anymore, you realize everybody is equal, whether
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:50.420]   you see them at the supermarket, shopping for lettuce and tomatoes or at a concert,
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.660]   or at the movies, you know, your boss, even if she's a billionaire, doesn't have more
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.420]   rights than you outside of work.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.140]   And that's the way it should be, I think, in the work environment, where we're treated
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.020]   equally, at least respectfully equally.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:13.200]   So the questions that I have to ask you all are, what would you do if you were already
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.240]   financially secure?
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.120]   What are you burying inside to conform?
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.640]   And which truths have you suppressed, so you don't jeopardize your status?
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.480]   One of the biggest benefits of FIRE is being able to be who you are, without as much fear
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.360]   of persecution or judgment.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.560]   Eight, you will lose and then regain your identity.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.600]   Given our work is a big part of who we are, once you leave your job, you will lose a part
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.640]   of your identity.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.760]   And the longer you work, the harder the transition to retirement or fake retirement will be.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.600]   It's definitely one of the negatives of early retirement I've talked about before.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.920]   And if you are truly retired, you might start feeling useless to society.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:05.560]   Many of you start feeling useless, the chances of feeling constantly sad or depressed or
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.440]   lonely go way up.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   Because at the end of the day, we all want to feel like we're contributing something
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   meaningful.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   I know I do.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.640]   It's one of the reasons why I write and I respond.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.340]   I spend these hours every single week for so long.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.560]   It feels good to be a contributor.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.120]   Therefore, nobody really retires early and does nothing.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.680]   Instead, early retirees eventually find something they would do for free because they enjoy
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   it.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.920]   So in my case, it's writing and connecting with people online.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.600]   I'm writing about my experiences, other people's experiences and stories.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.720]   I'm not pumping out endless search engine optimization affiliate content because that
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.160]   is boring.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   And I know it's a business and you can make money.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:56.040]   Yeah, I'll do some sponsor posts every once in a while, especially for those corporates
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.680]   supporting my endeavors such as my book.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.400]   But that's not the main reason why I want to write.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.000]   I want to write because it feels good.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   It's helpful.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It's cathartic.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.720]   And you will find a new identity that will replace your old one due to gaining a new
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.080]   purpose.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.800]   But you might have to lose that identity and figure things out for a while.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.920]   Okay, nine out of 11.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.200]   You start thinking more about what type of legacy you want to leave.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.760]   And you really don't think about legacy in your 20s or 30s.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.480]   You start thinking about your legacy, I think, in your 40s.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.760]   And also after you have children, because you know, or you hope, you know, God bless
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.200]   them, God bless your family, that they will outlive you.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.920]   I mean, I don't want to outlive anybody in my family.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.400]   So along with wanting a sense of purpose during fake retirement, you will also want to accomplish
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.920]   something you're very proud of.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.360]   In other words, you will want to leave behind something positive others will benefit from
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.240]   after you're gone.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.680]   For me, that's Financial Samurai because the internet lasts forever.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.960]   And also my soon to be released book, Buy This, Not That on July 19.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.680]   It has the potential to help a new segment of the book reading public.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.760]   I'm confident the book will change the reader's life for the better.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.720]   I can also die easier knowing I did everything possible to try and help others with their
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   finances.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.960]   Whether it's writing on financialsamurai.com, recording these podcasts, or writing this
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   book.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.200]   I don't think I could have worked more to try to help others gain financial independence.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.040]   Because trust me on this one, financial independence is worth fighting for.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.480]   Those hours that you put in early on or even now, will pay dividends in the future.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.680]   That time you spend learning about money, learning about investing, learning about new
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.760]   methodologies, just surrounding yourself with people who are on the same quest.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.360]   It's so amazing and it's so worth it.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.360]   Because once you get to about $300,000 in investable assets, you'll start getting that
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.520]   feeling like, "Hey, this could be what financial independence feels like."
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:11.760]   Because if you return 10% on $300,000, that's $30,000 and most people can probably live
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.700]   off that, right?
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:19.780]   And then as you start building momentum, it just becomes so fun, so encouraging, and it
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.980]   is something that you want to share with others because it feels so liberating.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.260]   When you look back on your life, you want to have some defining moments you'll always
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.740]   remember.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.460]   Such wonderful moments might include graduating from high school or college, getting your
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:41.740]   first job, starting a company, winning an award, and having your first baby.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:47.340]   Further, the more difficult the environment, the more you will want to create fond memories
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.260]   to shut out those difficult memories.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.700]   When I look back on the pandemic period, I will happily remember three things.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.380]   One, my wife birthing our daughter at the end of 2019.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:06.100]   Two, keeping our kids safe and providing them with lots of love, play, and attention.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.580]   And three, publishing a personal finance book that positively impacted everyone who read
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.580]   it.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.460]   All right, 10.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:21.140]   Nobody really cares what you do, so make sure you live for yourself.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.060]   This is so important, folks.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:31.340]   Whether you retire early to go on some huge trip around the world or you retire to start
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.600]   a new solopreneur business, do what you want.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.900]   The only people who may criticize your fake retirement are members of the Internet Retirement
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.020]   Police.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.860]   They'll try to arrest you for doing anything that generates income, anything that requires
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.060]   time, thinking, and effort.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:54.660]   Even if you say you are a fake retiree, sometimes, they might still lob grenades at you, especially
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.980]   if you spend any time on Twitter.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:03.460]   But the reality is, so long as you're not hurting anybody, everyday normal people don't
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.100]   care how you live your lifestyle.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.940]   Most people are just too busy worrying about their own problems.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.500]   Their own goals.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:17.300]   The only people who get bent out of shape about how you describe your situation are
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.540]   those who want what you have.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.020]   So accept your fake retirement in all its glory.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.620]   It helps reduce criticism.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.780]   Because really, the main goal is to conserve as much of your life energy as possible to
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.660]   do more of what you want.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:41.340]   At the end of the day, you're only letting yourself down if you don't pursue your dreams.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.540]   I was going to leave you with 10 points, but an 11th point came up.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.660]   And that is, your courage will continue to increase.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.860]   It's one of the biggest takeaways of fake retirement, early retirement.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.180]   The fear in your head is often worse than reality.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.580]   I see this time and time again.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:05.300]   In fact, fear is one of the key ingredients for achieving financial freedom.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:11.540]   Because without fear, you won't be motivated enough to save aggressively, to invest wisely,
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.740]   to plan for the various unknowns.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:21.180]   Fear of failure also makes you try harder to reduce your chances of failure.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.540]   It's a very positive feeling, fear.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.420]   And as your fear dissipates, your courage grows.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.420]   With regards to early retirement, courage first starts with giving up a paycheck and
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.740]   realizing being jobless isn't so bad.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.380]   You will most likely figure out a way to make things work by trying new things.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.340]   And worst case, you can always go back to work.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:49.460]   Remember, your financial independence number is not real if you don't change a suboptimal
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.460]   situation.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.420]   So if you think, you know, whatever it is you have, 500 grand, a million, 2 million,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:01.860]   5 million, whatnot, is financially independent, but you're still in a terrible marriage, you
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:09.740]   still work for a boss you don't like, you still live in a town that disrespects you.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.020]   Whatever the case may be, you've got to change.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.020]   You got to change.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:18.900]   If you're truly financially independent, you better use your money to change and make your
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   life better.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.760]   Otherwise, you got to keep on going.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.060]   One of the interesting things I've experienced is I've had a greater courage to be disliked
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.260]   by speaking my mind more often.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:37.700]   I'd much rather be authentic and lose readers than act like a power-hungry politician to
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.700]   grow support.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.300]   It just doesn't feel right.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.820]   In fact, it feels amazing not to have to pretend to be someone you are not.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:51.140]   In competitive sports, I just realized I've played 23 United States Tennis Association
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:57.460]   matches in the first half of 2022 after taking a two-year hiatus thanks to the virus.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:04.620]   The thing is, it's really tough to compete because your record is online forever and
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.380]   people don't want to compete and lose because it's embarrassing.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.300]   But I don't care.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   I just want to compete.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   I think it's fun.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:18.540]   Yes, fear of losing and the frustration of losing is still there, but I still want to
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.420]   compete so bring it on.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.820]   Gaining more courage to be yourself might be the most valuable personal development
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.980]   gift of this entire early retirement process.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   All right, everybody.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:38.340]   I hope you enjoyed the key takeaways after 10 years of fake retirement.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:45.940]   Ten years have gone by so quickly and let us not waste a single moment of our lives.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:51.300]   Being able to do what I want thanks to the money that I have is one of the main reasons
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:57.120]   why I wrote Buy This, Not That, How to Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:03.260]   The book will provide you the frameworks necessary to build more wealth quicker in a risk-appropriate
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:10.080]   manner and it will tackle some of life's biggest dilemmas many of us will face.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.020]   So I appreciate your support in picking up a hard copy.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.020]   You'll see the charts.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.420]   You'll see the beautiful art by Colleen Kong Savage.
