[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.800]   This week we welcome author and speaker,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.840]   Dr. Paul David Tripp.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.280]   Most recently, Paul is the author of the book,
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.280]   "Awe, Why It Matters for Everything We Think, Say, and Do."
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.000]   And to prove it, this week we're talking about
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.240]   how awe matters for our spiritual growth,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.080]   our Bible intake, our ministry aims,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.840]   and even our news consumption, our weight loss attempts,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.400]   our anxieties, our parenting methods,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.720]   and our expectations of marriage and romantic love,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.800]   all of that.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.880]   And today I wanna talk about parenting, Paul,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.440]   because you mentioned parenting in the book,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.860]   and you're finishing up another full book on parenting too.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.720]   So explain for us why you're writing another parenting book.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   - Well, frankly, the thing that initiated the book
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720]   was Crossway came and asked me if I'd be interested
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   in doing a parenting book,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.840]   and I had no interest in that at all.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.640]   But I began to reflect on conversations I've had
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.800]   over the years with people who have read my brother,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.520]   Ted's book, "Shepherding Child's Heart,"
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.940]   has read my book, "Age of Opportunity"
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.040]   about parenting teens.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.920]   I've been concerned about the way those books
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.840]   are used by parents.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.200]   And I thought as well meaning those parents are,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.580]   the thing that was missing was the understanding
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.220]   of the gospel underpinnings of those books.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.520]   And so this new parenting book basically
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.180]   is 15 gospel principles that begin every chapter,
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.600]   and then those gospel principles are applied
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.060]   to the process of parenting.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.240]   I think it's a way of looking at parenting
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.000]   through the lens of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.160]   in a very practical way.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.000]   - Interesting.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.380]   It dawns on me now that what awes my kids
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.740]   and what awes me are often very different things,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.940]   different foods and music styles and movies.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.540]   How does awe inform my work as a dad
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.700]   and our work as parents?
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.380]   - Well, one of the things you have to realize
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.380]   is you're never just dealing with behavior problems
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.100]   in your children.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.760]   You're always also dealing with heart problems.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   And the central focus of heart problems
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.800]   is this issue of awe.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.480]   You have to look at your child and you have to think
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.480]   that this child was designed by God for awe.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.040]   What that means is the awe of something
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.760]   will capture his heart.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.560]   And what captures his heart will control his behavior.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.060]   Let me give an example.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.740]   Young children are naturally in awe of themselves,
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.180]   inserting themselves in the center of the world,
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.900]   making it all about them.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.560]   So that battle about what to eat,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.640]   I won't eat my peas, is not because I've studied diet
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.960]   and I realize that peas don't need to be part of my diet.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.260]   It's not about diet at all.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.100]   It's about awe.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.620]   If I'm in awe of myself, then I do not want to be ruled.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.640]   I do not want to be told what to do.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.180]   You will not tell me what to put in my mouth.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.840]   Now to treat that just as a diet issue
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.420]   sort of misses the point of what's really initiating that
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.680]   or when to go to sleep or what's appropriate to wear where
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.360]   or who my friends should be
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.960]   or what I should watch on television
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   or look at on my computer.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   All of those are subsets of a different issue
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.340]   that if I'm in awe amnesiac,
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.500]   I think the universe is about me
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.100]   and I should be able to control and dictate
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.640]   what I want to do, how I want to do it
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.060]   and when I want to do it.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.340]   So what I want to do is expose my children
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.260]   to one who is greater,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.820]   to use every tool that's available to me
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.820]   to blow them away with the stunning glory of God.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.020]   Now God's helped us because he's made a world
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.660]   that reveals him so it's not unnatural
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.660]   to talk about God all the time.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.180]   It's positively unnatural not to.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.380]   Here's where all this goes.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.180]   It's not enough just to fight the battle of behavior.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.940]   You have to fight the battle of awe
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.200]   on behalf of your children as well.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.700]   - Yeah, this is so huge.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.340]   So if I understand your concern,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.660]   rule-centered prohibition parenting cannot do this
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.540]   but how do rules and awe work together?
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.620]   - So children need authority in their lives.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.860]   They need their lives to be directed by God's law.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.820]   God's law is a good thing.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.820]   The thing that you need to realize is all reveals sin,
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.940]   all gives me a guide for my living
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.620]   but law can never rescue my heart.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.700]   And so as I'm laying out reasonable rules for my children
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.300]   that are an extension of God's revealed law in scripture,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.300]   I want to also introduce them to the amazing wisdom,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.120]   the amazing love, the amazing grace,
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.900]   the presence and power of the one
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.580]   who is the giver of that law
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.300]   because what law is meant to do
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.220]   like everything else that God gives us is drive us to Him.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.220]   And so wouldn't it be sad to divorce God from his law
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.620]   and to make it a moral standard
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.220]   that has no redeemer behind it?
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.340]   That's not biblical Christianity.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.300]   That's not a biblical view of life.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   And so I want to use every moment of rule introduction,
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.600]   every moment of correction, every moment of discipline
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   to point back to this amazing God who is wiser than we are,
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.760]   who knows what's best for us and in love reveal that to us.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.360]   - Well, it sounds like your new book is gonna be a great one.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.480]   When is your new parenting book out?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.620]   - I have no idea.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.640]   [laughing]
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.540]   - Okay, we'll be looking for it.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.900]   Be watching for Paul Tripp's new book
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.060]   on parenting from Crossway,
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.860]   released sometime in 2016.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.460]   The title, at least I do know,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.060]   it's "Parenting, the 15 Gospel Principles
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.760]   that Can Radically Change Your Family."
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.420]   I am really looking forward to it.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.580]   And Paul joins us again tomorrow
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.580]   and we will look at all as it relates
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.760]   to marriage and romantic love.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.620]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.200]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.780]   [upbeat music]
