[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   If the answer is no, we're in a peaking phase,
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.500]   then we're actually going to use what I call acute state shifters.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.920]   So this is a whole host of little tricks that I have
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.360]   that can change HRV or any recovery metric within seconds.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.160]   Again, these are not chronic fixes.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.500]   This is just, I'm having a bad day today.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.240]   I feel like crap.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.960]   Can I make myself feel better right now?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.440]   And so I kind of call these parlor tricks.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.200]   A lot of the times, and there's a thousand of them.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.440]   We are certainly not going to go over them,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.160]   but I'll give you some examples.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.040]   You can pull out, first of all, physical movement.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.880]   We'll do it.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.960]   You'd be stunned how just doing some yoga,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.120]   moving around, doing some jumping jacks,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   starting your workout.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.800]   I mean, you've probably experienced this.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.760]   It's sort of cliche in our world at this point,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   but if you ever do any serious lifting
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.160]   over a serious amount of time,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.000]   there will be days in which you walk in the gym
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.580]   and you feel awful.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.080]   And somehow that day, you set a lifetime PR.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.360]   - Yeah, that's a strange, strange phenomena.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   I've experienced that more than a few times.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.360]   It's rare.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.000]   The inverse is rare, however.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.500]   You feel great.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.480]   You have a horrible workout.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.840]   It happens, and it can happen
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.120]   for any number of different reasons.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.080]   But yeah, I think the former,
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.000]   when one isn't feeling very good,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.560]   and then somehow it's a terrific workout,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.960]   does set a kind of a seed of doubt
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.360]   as to how good our subjective assessments really are,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.760]   which I guess is why we're talking
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.560]   about objective assessments like HRV.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.480]   - And remember, if it's a single day here,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.060]   you can even do hard training.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.400]   People sort of have this idea like,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   well, if you get up and your recovery score's down,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   do a lighter day.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.000]   That's probably, I'm probably never making that choice,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.720]   to be honest, not in this situation.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.560]   Remember, this is one bad day,
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.000]   and we are in a phase of even trying
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880]   to improve performance right now.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.240]   Like, we're probably still training hard.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.880]   You will, again, often see, I felt terrible,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160]   then I trained super hard,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   and it totally changed my day around.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   This is all can happen.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.400]   So exercise is my first love here.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.960]   Absolutely breathing.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.540]   Any sort of up-regulation breathing.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.920]   So we talked a lot about down-regulation breathing.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.200]   Just do the opposite, right?
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.720]   And so this is when hyperventilation strategies can work.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.040]   Instead of accentuating the exhale,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.680]   you accentuate the inhale, or you restrict the exhales.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.880]   This is working on the exact opposite situation.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.360]   You can also play little, this is where things like music,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.700]   motivational quotes, if you're the type
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.080]   that follows people on Instagram that motivates you,
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.720]   or can work with these things.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.960]   Coaching tactics.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.720]   These can be things like finding out
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.640]   or talking about that person's why.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.680]   You sort of shared something, a mantra you use
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.040]   when you're training hard to keep you go better,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.360]   and I'm not gonna ask you to share that now,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   but some people have this sometimes, right?
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.240]   Or you may have this conversation with your athlete.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.920]   We call this finding out your why, right?
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.000]   So finding out like, why are you really here?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.840]   What are we doing here?
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.360]   And a lot of times you'll hear things like,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.120]   it's because I grew up poor
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.240]   and I don't ever wanna be poor again.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   Okay, great.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.200]   Or this is for my children, or like any number of things.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.020]   And you can pull that out on these days.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.320]   You need to be really careful.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   This is why I call these parlor tricks.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.920]   Because when you play that card too often,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.440]   it starts to lose effect, right?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.280]   And you can only dig to a hole so often
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.000]   before it's sort of like a...
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.600]   The same thing as with music, right?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.040]   Every time you go to the weight room,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.320]   it's blasting death metal at level 10.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.760]   Well, eventually it's no longer motivating, right?
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   It's no longer helpful.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.360]   So you wanna deploy these things strategically.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.520]   - Yeah, the phrase that comes to mind is signal to noise.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.720]   The nervous system, especially the dopamine system
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.640]   and the adrenaline system,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.040]   which are a part of this larger system
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.240]   called the catecholamine system.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   So that's dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.400]   The get up and go, focus on external goals,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.880]   movement associated, and on and on.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   That system responds best to high signal relative to noise.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.400]   So if you're, as you pointed out,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   listening to music every time,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.520]   drinking a ton of caffeine, energy drinks,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.680]   pre-workout, nootropics,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.900]   and then stacking all those things,
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.320]   sometimes refer to this as dopamine stacking,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.360]   informally referred to as dopamine stacking.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.520]   You're doing all those things.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.360]   And then, first of all,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.120]   if you're wondering why later that afternoon
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.560]   or the next day, you're feeling like you're under a cloud,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.800]   well, it's obvious, your catecholamine system crashed.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.080]   But it's also that you don't necessarily
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.560]   become dependent on it.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.880]   It's just that you start to wonder whether or not
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.200]   you have the internal mechanisms and motivation
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.520]   to train without those things.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.920]   And so one tends to use them more and more,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.560]   and then they have a diminishing effect over time.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.280]   The rule that I've been sort of applying has been,
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.600]   I never do two workouts in a row
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.200]   where I'm stacking in stimulants, loud music,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.120]   and any kind of sort of high-potency inspiration.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.960]   However, every set in the gym or when I run,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.720]   I really try and be diligent about form
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   and attention to what I'm doing.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.640]   The one exception would be
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.840]   the long-duration endurance work.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.360]   Part of the reason I do that work
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.800]   is to let my mind go into states of drifting,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.920]   of not trying to think in complete sentences
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.240]   or even close to it,
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.920]   just let my brain kind of idle at a low hum.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.640]   And for that reason, generally listen to something
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.440]   that's more of a story or don't listen to anything at all
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.080]   and just let my thoughts kind of spool through.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.000]   Anyway, I don't want to take us too far off track,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.320]   but I think this idea of signal to noise
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.280]   will resonate with the engineers out there.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.360]   But since most people are likely not engineers,
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.960]   it is the way that the nervous system works,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.400]   evidenced by the fact that whatever area of your body
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.520]   right now is in contact with a chair
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.040]   or any other surface that it's been in contact with
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   for more than a few seconds,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.720]   you forget that it's in contact with it
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.800]   because there's low signal to noise at that point.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.640]   - A similar note,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.440]   you actually mentioned stimulants basically there,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.720]   whether you're talking caffeine or any other stimulant,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.600]   any other cortisol modulators or adaptogens,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.160]   any of these things fall in the category.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   If you're not using them consistently
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.120]   and you're having a rough day
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.320]   and all of a sudden you throw down
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.200]   200 milligrams of caffeine,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.640]   it's going to change real fast, the equation.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.200]   - Strong performance enhancing effect.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.040]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.640]   - For these reasons, right?
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.200]   So we mentioned a couple of them, breath work, food,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.400]   more calories, just eating some food.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.720]   Sometimes we'll give people what we call comfort foods.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.960]   So this is just like, hey, you're from Georgia
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.600]   and we know you love grits.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.120]   So we're having grits for breakfast.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960]   Oh my, great.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.600]   Like just something to change your mood,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.800]   acute state shifters to alter it.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.160]   The other couple of tricks here are light.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.080]   So if we know that maybe say multiple people
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.920]   are struggling that day,
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.720]   maybe we'll put on the lights extra bright.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   We'll bring in some extra things
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.840]   and just get it more light in the area.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   That doesn't even count actually going outside
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.120]   and seeing the sun, but perhaps we'll do that.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.160]   And then other little tricks
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.080]   that I've learned over the years
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.320]   is one particular thing I love is literally drawing a line,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.000]   a physical line on the ground.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.720]   And you look at that line and you say like,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.200]   I'm going to train today
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.320]   and I'm going to accomplish this effort.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm not going to walk past this line
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.840]   and into that training space
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.040]   until I'm ready to give that effort.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.720]   And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.840]   but it's the physical barrier is very important
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.920]   to saying like, I'm not just going to get through it.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.160]   I'm going to actually perform the way I want to perform
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   or I'm not going to do it.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.200]   And I'm not going to cross this line
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   until I'm ready to make that happen.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.320]   - I really liked that tool.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.760]   It also brings to mind the importance
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.440]   of at least thinking about how your relationship
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.320]   with your phone during training can perhaps help,
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.480]   but also impede workout motivation and performance.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.400]   In an earlier episode,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.520]   you mentioned that if people are using their phone
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.720]   to play music during their workout,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.520]   that they establish the complete playlist
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.840]   prior to initiating the workout
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.680]   and then not deviate from that playlist,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.360]   as opposed to changing it in the middle,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.480]   because there's just too much of an impulse
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.560]   to also check social media, check email,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.080]   check text messages.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.320]   I mean, the way I think about the phone actually
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.400]   is it's a bunch of little brain areas.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.200]   It's got a memory system for you.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.600]   It's got lookup tables for lookup tables.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.040]   It's got websites to look things up on the internet.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's got photos.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.120]   I mean, it is so rich with sensory data
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.880]   and it's so closely linked to our own brain architecture.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.200]   The algorithms are designed for those to be that way,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.320]   that I always think about it
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.840]   as bringing in a second person with me,
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.160]   but that person is my twin
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.920]   that has severe attention issues.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.880]   And for those that already have attention issues,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.160]   just think about this as a twin
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.120]   that would then compound you by tapping on your shoulder,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.960]   talking to you all the time, interrupting you.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.520]   Somebody that you like a lot,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   but that frankly is a little bit irritating
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.080]   in that they're interrupting your ability to really show up
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.840]   and also your ability to show up for them.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.600]   So I started to think about the phone as an entire individual
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.160]   and that it represents me
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.960]   and certainly not the better version of me.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.920]   - Great, exactly.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.680]   You actually mentioned something else
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.040]   that we'll use occasionally in what we call brain games
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.800]   or puzzles, whether this is a crossword puzzle
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.120]   or something where you actually lose
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.760]   your thought of self for a second
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.520]   and your brain gets engaged in a task
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.680]   that you weren't regretting or even thinking about.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.120]   These can be stupid little games.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.480]   It could be little challenges,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.640]   especially if you're in like a group or a team setting.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.560]   All right, like we're going to play one round of dodgeball
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.680]   or we're going to play one round of thumb wars.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.160]   - So you do encourage this?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.120]   - Yeah. - I see.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.920]   - So you would play like a thing instead of warming up.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.360]   It's like, all right, get in and everyone get going.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.800]   We're going to get your foam roller,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   your diamond or whatever thing.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.080]   It's just like, all right, everyone line up
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.600]   and we're going to play thumb wars to see who wins.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.640]   Right, just like whatever, right?
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.960]   And all of a sudden you've snapped into a new mental shift
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.360]   or literally playing brain games,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.760]   playing Tetris on your phone.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.880]   Like any of these things can work in this acute setting.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.180]   (upbeat music)
