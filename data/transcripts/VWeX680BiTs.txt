[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   Who is God?
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.920]   It's as important of a question as it gets, and we get it a lot, from international listeners
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.920]   especially.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.320]   We're going to address the question today and maybe on Monday as well.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.840]   This might bleed over into two episodes.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.800]   This particular question has come to us from listeners like Gamal, Olyanka, Ezekiel, Bobby,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.720]   Zandy, Matthew, Giovanni, Jerry, Tom, and Esther.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.680]   Thank you for all the emails that have come in on this question.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.960]   They're all asking the same question to you, Pastor John.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.640]   Who is God?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.720]   I love it when people are clear enough and straightforward enough and honest enough to
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.120]   ask straight out, "Who is God?"
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.480]   I think it's right and helpful to break that question sometimes into parts, namely, how
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.360]   in the world can we even know the answer?
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.320]   Where can we look?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.760]   Has God actually revealed the answer to the question somewhere and then, okay, if He has,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.200]   who are you, God?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.640]   So when I put myself in the place of a person asking, "Who is God?"
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840]   I can't help but think that perhaps the first question someone should ask is, "Who in the
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.440]   world does John Piper think he is to answer the greatest question in the world?"
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.280]   And the answer is that John Piper is a pointer.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.600]   The revelation of God to man does not happen in me.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560]   All I can do is point to it.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.680]   There, there it is.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.280]   That's the revelation of God.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.960]   That's where God has chosen to make known who He is.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   Look there.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.600]   Listen to that.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.840]   So where should we look?
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.920]   Where am I pointing?
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   Where does John Piper point?
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.400]   And what will you see when you look there?
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.840]   I'm going to point to five places where I hope you will look.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.920]   Not to me.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.360]   Look there, where you will look, places where God has revealed Himself to us to tell us
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.440]   who He is.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.840]   First, look to Jesus, Jesus Christ.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.360]   Jesus said in the Gospel of John, chapter 18, verse 37, "For this purpose I have come
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.200]   into the world, to bear witness to the truth."
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.760]   And in John 14, 6, He said, "I am the truth.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.560]   No one comes to God except through me."
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.040]   And then in chapter 8, verse 19, He said, "If you knew me, you would know God."
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.120]   You'd know who He is.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.240]   Why?
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.640]   Because He said in John 10, 30, "I and the Father are one."
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.160]   Nobody in the history of the world has made such lavish claims.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.640]   Maybe you could even say crazy claims, and then backed them up with a life of integrity
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.080]   and beauty and power.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.920]   The greatest decision anybody, like those listening to this podcast, could ever make
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.240]   is whether Jesus was telling the truth.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.200]   How can you know that?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.840]   How can you know if Jesus was telling the truth?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.680]   And the answer is by getting to know Him, by reading the four portraits of His life
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.280]   called the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.840]   If you're not sure about Him, I hope you will make this a top priority in your life.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.000]   Is Jesus telling the truth about Himself and about who God is?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.680]   Here's the second place that I point you for a revelation of who God is.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.880]   Before Jesus was crucified and rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, He said to those
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.960]   He had chosen to be His authorized spokesmen, He said this, "When the Spirit of truth
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.560]   comes, whom I will send, He will guide you into all the truth."
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.360]   That's John 16, verse 13.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   In other words, not only did Jesus claim to speak the truth and to be the revelation of
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:03.440]   who God is, but He also provided for the truthful writing about Him and His truth through those
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.600]   first followers.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.000]   These writings are called the New Testament.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.400]   The Spirit-inspired writings say this, "Jesus is the radiance of the glory of God, the exact
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.320]   imprint of His nature, and He upholds the universe by the word of His power."
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.400]   That's Hebrews 1, verses 2 and 3.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:34.560]   So Jesus Himself reveals who God is, and the writers that He chose reveal who God is.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.160]   There's the third place to look for who God is.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:49.600]   Jesus Himself and His followers pointed us to the Jewish scriptures as a reliable revelation
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.080]   of who God is.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.640]   The Jews call this book the Tanakh, which is an acronym for the Law, the Prophets, and
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.320]   the Wisdom writings.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.440]   And Christians call it the Old Testament.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.200]   Members of Jesus do not reject the Jewish scriptures.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.400]   We believe that Jesus fulfills the Jewish scriptures.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.720]   He doesn't reject them.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.280]   He said, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law and the Prophets.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.480]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them," Matthew 5, verse 17.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.960]   Which is why the Christian Bible is made up of both Old Testament, the Jewish scriptures,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   and the New Testament written by those followers of Jesus.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.480]   Here's the fourth place to look for a revelation of who God is.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.860]   Look to the natural world, nature.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:53.520]   Both the New Testament and Old Testament point to nature, and they say, "Look, if you have
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.280]   eyes to see, God is revealed there.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.240]   Who He is is revealed there.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.840]   Nature is not God, but God is the creator of nature and reveals Himself through nature."
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.880]   The Old Testament says it this way, "The heavens are telling the glory of God, and
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.320]   the sky above proclaims His handiwork."
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   That's Psalm 19, verse 1.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.160]   And the New Testament says it like this, "God's invisible attributes, namely His eternal power
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:34.480]   and divine nature, have been clearly perceived in the things that have been made," Romans
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.040]   1, 19 and 20.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:46.200]   Now here's the final, the fifth place to look for who God is, namely, look into your own
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.000]   heart, your own conscience.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.840]   Now I'm not saying you can dream up who God is out of the imaginations of your own heart
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.120]   and make Him be anything you want Him to be.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.520]   A lot of people try to do that.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.000]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.760]   That will get you nowhere.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   Just the opposite.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:14.820]   What I'm saying is your heart confronts you, if you're honest, confronts you with a stubborn
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.520]   reality that can't be twisted into anything we please.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:29.200]   The New Testament says this, "God's law is written on their hearts, while their conscience
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:37.440]   bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them."
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.480]   That's Romans 2, 14 to 16.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:49.040]   In other words, our own hearts tell us there is a God whose law is written on our conscience,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:58.640]   and we have broken that law, and we all know it, we feel it deeply in our most honest moments.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:06.360]   So when I hear the question, the absolutely essential question that I wish everybody in
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.160]   the world were asking with blood earnest seriousness, "Who is God?"
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.600]   My first thought is, "John Piper is not a source of revelation.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.720]   I am a voice crying in the wilderness, so to speak, like old John the Baptist, a pointer.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   Look, look, I must decrease, Jesus must increase.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.760]   He is the main revelation of who God is."
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.920]   The New Testament that he has inspired is a true revelation of who God is.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:46.640]   The Jewish scriptures, with Jesus as their fulfillment, the whole Old Testament is a
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.200]   true revelation of who God is.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:57.760]   Nature cries out every morning and every night and all day long, "There is a powerful, glorious,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.480]   wise Creator God."
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.320]   And every person, all of us, know deep down in our heart, in the most sober moments of
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.080]   our lives, that we are not a mere collection of atoms and molecules and chemicals and energy
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.880]   in a meaningless evolutionary process.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.000]   We know, we know that He's not who we are.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.800]   Written on our hearts is a revelation that there is a God and that He has a will for
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.440]   His creatures to know Him and thank Him and make much of Him.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:42.760]   And we know we have all fallen short, which makes the rest of this question all the more
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.960]   important.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.040]   Who is God?
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.200]   Is He the kind of being who is not only powerful, but personal?
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:00.360]   Is He mainly angry with the world because we've all failed so badly to honor Him?
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.520]   Or is He a God of mercy or both justice and mercy?
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.800]   Has God taken any action to help us?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.600]   Might He even want a relationship with us?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:22.080]   So I would plead with everybody who's listening, consider these questions.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.800]   The most important questions of your life.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.760]   And consider these five places where God has revealed Himself.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.560]   Search them out, test them.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.400]   Say to God, "I am ready to believe and submit.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.160]   If this is true, I am ready.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   Show me who you are."
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   Wonderful.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   All right.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.360]   So that was the setup answer for the question of who is God.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.560]   Now we'll start next week with the answer to that question.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.400]   Thank you for listening.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.360]   And you can ask a question of your own.

[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   It's amazing.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   A nice milestone.
