[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.360]   Alright, let's do one more deep work question.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.560]   We have one here from Heather.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.840]   Heather asks, how do I make a better transition from working from
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.960]   home to afterschool with the kids?
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.400]   So Heather says, pre COVID, my transition from a working mindset to mom
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.040]   mindset was easy since there was a 30 minute commute from the office to aftercare.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.080]   Now I permanently work from home and there is no transition.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.760]   They get off the bus when school is out.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.440]   She says in parentheses, we nixed aftercare since I am here, but
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.560]   is that a bad idea in parentheses?
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.320]   But I'm still getting a few things done during that hour.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.840]   Thoughts?
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.160]   All right.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.120]   Well, Heather, my specific thought for your situation is you
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.800]   should not have nixed the aftercare.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.160]   Work is work.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.200]   Don't let the fact that the work is happening at your home make you change
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.160]   the status of that work to be half work.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.520]   Work slash I'm also doing another job, which is taking care of my
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.440]   kids after they get home from school.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.920]   I mean, that's sort of equivalent of being like, I work at this office job,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.360]   but for like two hours in the afternoon, I'm also serving food in the cafeteria.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.400]   Your bosses will be like, well, you can't have both those jobs at the same time.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.600]   Right?
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.880]   Like, you know, when you're in the, when you're here in the office, you can't
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   also be serving food in the cafeteria.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.840]   Like this is your job here.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.640]   Uh, but when we work from home, we blur those lines a lot more and we say, yeah,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.360]   but I could do like childcare too.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.760]   And can I just mix it all together?
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.760]   And it's very hard to do.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.080]   This is why during the heat of the pandemic, when, when schools were
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.320]   closed and offices were closed, I kept describing the situation as a dumpster
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.520]   fire, because it was impossible.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.720]   When you ask people, do all your work and do all the childcare
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.960]   and do that at the same time.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   It's like being the cafeteria worker at the same time that
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.640]   you're trying to be an accountant.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.520]   It's impossible.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.760]   And we pretended like it's not.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.920]   So my specific answer for you, Heather is if at all possible, financially
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.360]   go back to exactly the same care setup you had pre pandemic.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.720]   And it sounds like the setup you had was after school, your kids went to
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   aftercare, which brought them to the normal end of a standard nine to five
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.160]   workday, and then you would pick them up.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.240]   Go back to that aftercare.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.720]   Yes, you're working at home, but who cares you're working till work is over.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.280]   Uh, and then you're shifting over to the mom mindset, not trying to mix the two.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.400]   So if that's possible, that's what I would suggest.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.360]   Let me give a more general answer here about, I think a very good point.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   More generally shutting down when you have a hazy boundary between work and
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   non-work, which, which again, is pretty common, especially in these work from home
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.000]   days.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.320]   Uh, so you might have a, this hazy period.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.120]   So let's say the aftercare thing doesn't work out.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.240]   You have this hazy period where you're kind of working and you're kind of doing
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.720]   something else and you recognize this and you, you know, you don't schedule
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.800]   meetings and you know, you're just going to get a little bit done because
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   you're also doing childcare.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   You have to find how to have a definitive shutdown that still works.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.480]   So even if you're in this hazy period, have a definitive into the hazy period.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.040]   All right.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.480]   Now I'm doing my shutdown complete.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.200]   Even though the last 90 minutes I've been half shut down.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.960]   Uh, I have to get my kids going with their homework, but I have to return and
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.400]   answer emails and I have to get snacks.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.320]   Then I'm going back and sending out these reports, even though that's back and
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.880]   forth and hazy, have a clear shutdown at the end of that, where you're like now
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.000]   work is completely done.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.320]   Uh, now if possible, if you can have one that gets you out of your house and
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.480]   completely changes your state, I think that would be good.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.920]   I don't know your marital situation, but if you have, let's say a partner that's
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.440]   working, it sounds like here, maybe they're working at an office when they
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.480]   come back, that spells you to do a 30 minute transition to really fully
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.600]   change your mindset.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.360]   I think exercise is a good one here.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480]   I've been doing this some more, especially on my teaching days when I
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.280]   can't get exercise in earlier in the day.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.400]   Uh, I'll do this when I'm with the kids in the afternoon.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.320]   I'll bring, I'll set it up.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.840]   So, you know, maybe once working on their homework and once playing
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.320]   Minecraft and I'll let my youngest, I'll bring them down to the basement to
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.760]   where my exercise equipment is like, okay, you can watch this video here.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.240]   Um, and then I'm going to go in the garage and, you know, do evil things to
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.360]   a rowing machine.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.040]   And it's a transition, even though I'm kind of watching the kids, the exercise
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.160]   is very different.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.240]   It's very different than looking at a screen.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.600]   And it really is a way of, okay, now I come out of that and I physically
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.800]   changed my state and I come out of that, not doing other types of work.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.480]   So have a clear shutdown.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:33.880]   Even if that shutdown happens after a period of sort of hazy boundaries.
