[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.480]   We head into Thanksgiving in a few days
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.660]   and Pastor John, there was recently a discussion online
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.880]   among non-Christian philosophers
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.620]   and it started out with an old Woody Allen line
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.640]   he once said in a movie.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.240]   He said this, "If one guy is starving someplace,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.800]   it puts a cramp in my evening," end quote.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.960]   Which raises this question, can a person truly experience
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680]   happiness without ignorance and apathy
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.380]   of the suffering of others?
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.400]   To be completely insensitive to suffering in this world
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.800]   is to be a sociopath.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.620]   To be completely sensitive to the suffering of others,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.760]   you would pretty much die of grief
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.360]   from the collective suffering of the world.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.120]   So if empathy means you cannot enjoy dinner
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.020]   with a starving child staring at you near the dinner table,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020]   yet your dinner can resume normally
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.500]   if that starving child exists behind a wall,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.240]   does it seem that ignorance then
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.480]   is an important requisite for happiness?
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.640]   So here's the question, Pastor John,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.940]   does my happiness require ignorance or even apathy
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.280]   with the suffering of others?
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.280]   - I doubt that I have a fully satisfying answer to this,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.800]   even for myself, and I'm not sure there is
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.120]   a theoretically satisfying answer that deals
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.120]   in quantities of knowledge and apathy and happiness.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.240]   I suspect that the answer to this is found
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.700]   in becoming a kind of person in the image of Christ
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700]   who learns how best to love within the limitations
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.040]   in this world of suffering.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.320]   But having said I'm not sure there is an answer,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800]   here's my best effort to say something helpful,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.320]   at least this is what I preach to myself.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.120]   Number one, the way I've approached this question
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   in the past is to note that Paul said in Romans 12, 15,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.920]   "Rejoice with those who rejoice
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.480]   and weep with those who weep."
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.040]   And there are people who are weeping right now,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.880]   and there are people who are rejoicing right now,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   even in our own circle, not to mention the millions
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.180]   who are weeping and rejoicing around the world.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.720]   And my answer to that paradox has been
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   that Christians are always sorrowful at one level
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.860]   and happy at another level, and we give expression
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.480]   to the one or the other according to whether we are
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.000]   at a wedding or a funeral, even though we know
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.920]   at the wedding that a family is at the hospital right now
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.060]   during the wedding with the dying wife and mother,
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.840]   and we'll be there in a few hours probably,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.360]   and we're not gonna ruin the wedding.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.320]   One of the most important pastoral verses in the Bible
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.540]   is 2 Corinthians 6, 10, where Paul says,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.900]   "He is sorrowful yet always rejoicing."
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.680]   That's what I mean by saying Christians carry
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   in their souls a sadness in this life that never goes away.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960]   And they carry a joy in this life that never goes away.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.080]   So that's my first observation from Romans 12, 15
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.640]   and 2 Corinthians 6, 10.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.080]   Here's a second set of thoughts.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.160]   The parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.920]   is relevant to the issue of dealing with the suffering
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.440]   of the world that's far away and near at hand.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.760]   Jesus tells the parable in response
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   to a man's self-justifying question,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.480]   who is my neighbor, because he realizes
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.880]   he can't love everybody the way he loves himself.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.960]   And so he's trying to figure out,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.120]   well, who don't I have to love like this?
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.200]   And Jesus doesn't like that question.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.320]   He's not happy with the way this man posed the question.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   So he tells the story of the man who's beaten
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.400]   and left for dead on the side of the road,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.920]   and the priest goes by on the side and doesn't help,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.560]   and the Levite goes by and doesn't help,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   and a Samaritan stops and he helps him.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.960]   And Jesus ends the parable like this.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.320]   Which of these three do you think
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.080]   prove to be neighbor to the man?
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.040]   He switched the question.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.640]   Prove to be neighbor to the man who fell among robbers.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.400]   And the man said, well, the one who showed compassion.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   And Jesus said, you go and do likewise.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.720]   And that's the end of the story.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.560]   That's the end.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.960]   He's not gonna deal with this man anymore.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.000]   In other words, it seems like you don't solve the problem
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.600]   of the commandment, love your neighbor,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.800]   by figuring out who qualifies and who doesn't.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.880]   Like, who can be excluded?
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.720]   Who are my non-neighbors?
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.360]   Good, I don't have to worry about them.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   Rather, you become a kind of person who can't pass by
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.760]   on the other side of the road
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.000]   when there is suffering within your touch.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.760]   Take the opportunities to love and serve at hand,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.480]   and you will prove to be a kind of person
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   that God wants you to be.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.040]   Jesus healed people in his past.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.200]   He didn't heal the American Indians.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.680]   And he didn't heal the Chinese.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.960]   And he didn't heal the people in India in his day.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.720]   He healed the ones along the road who cried out
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.640]   that he could reach out and touch.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.840]   And then with a clear conscience,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.880]   he sat down and feasted with the publicans,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.200]   because even there, he was a physician,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.280]   meeting with people because he loved them
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.600]   and wanted to do them good, even at their parties.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.440]   So that's my second cluster of thoughts around Luke 10,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.080]   One more set of thoughts.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.200]   Yes, it is necessary that we be ignorant
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.600]   in order to be happy.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.000]   But what I mean is that it's necessary
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.160]   that we accept our finitude.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.920]   Only God is not ignorant.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.760]   Only God knows all the suffering in the world.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.560]   If we knew all, we would be contenders for deity,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.320]   and we know what happens to contenders for deity.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.400]   They lose.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.600]   So ignorance, accepting our finitude,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.960]   is essential for our creaturehood
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.080]   and therefore for our happiness.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   The reason God can be infinite in knowledge
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.960]   and infinite in happiness
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   is that only God has other infinite attributes
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.680]   that make it possible for him to handle infinite knowledge.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.480]   Only God has infinite wisdom and infinite goodness
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.880]   to see how all the suffering of the world
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.120]   will someday fit into a plan that makes sense of it all.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.000]   We don't.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.440]   We don't have that capacity.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.000]   Therefore, we can't handle that kind of infinite knowledge.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So in our case, I would put it like this.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.080]   The more our knowledge of suffering increases,
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.240]   and today it does,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.400]   the more the other godlike attributes must increase,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.920]   not to make us God, but to be more like God.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.400]   The other godlike attributes have to increase
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.640]   lest we be crushed under the weight
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.760]   of simultaneous multiplied empathies
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.200]   or hardened with self-protecting indifference.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.840]   These other attributes that I'm thinking about
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.000]   are things like greater capacities for mercy,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.760]   greater capacities for compassion, on the one hand,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.880]   and a growing grasp, this one's really essential,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.720]   a growing grasp of biblical truth
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   that gives some meaning to the suffering of the world,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.040]   even the suffering we can't reach
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.360]   and what is happening to people out there
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.480]   and what meaning that might have.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   If these other godlike attributes don't increase in us
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.120]   in proportion to our awareness
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.480]   and our experience of suffering,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   we're gonna be overwhelmed.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   So in the end, my sense is that we should all
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.680]   immerse ourselves in the life and the teaching
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   and the work of Christ so that we learn with Him
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.840]   in real experience what it is to be sorrowful
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.200]   and yet always rejoicing,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   always seeking to spread that joy to as many as we can.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.520]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.880]   And this leads me to ask another philosophical question
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.760]   about happiness, and that is,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.440]   are smart people less happy?
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.760]   Ernest Hemingway said so,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.840]   but I wanna hear from you, Pastor John, tomorrow.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.320]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
