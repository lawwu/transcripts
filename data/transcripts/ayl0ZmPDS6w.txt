[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   All right, Jesse, I think we have five good calls
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.400]   on the docket.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.220]   What's our first?
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.000]   - All right, our first call is about a professional worker
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   going to a training,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980]   wants your advice on how to approach it.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.640]   - Hi Cal, my name is Spencer
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   and I'm a security engineer and information security officer.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.980]   I would like to know how to best tackle
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.980]   the training opportunity I have coming up in two months.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.600]   On two months, I get to take a week long
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.920]   security training course
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.840]   that's about eight hours a day and pretty intense.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.360]   Some people call it the experience of learning security
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.400]   through a fire hose.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.480]   I've reviewed the syllabus for the course
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   and I've started reading a chapter a day
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.160]   on some of the topics in the syllabus,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.460]   but I still wanna get the most
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.420]   out of this training experience.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.680]   How do I stay engaged when I have four eight hour days
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.560]   in a row of really deep learning?
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.100]   This is also in an area that I'm not as comfortable with.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.000]   Any tips and tricks would be helpful.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.840]   Thank you.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.040]   - It's a good question.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280]   I'm gonna actually go back and draw from advice
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.880]   I used to give to college students
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.160]   to help give you some guidance
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.180]   about this particular endeavor.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.720]   Now, first, I'm gonna recommend
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.920]   not reading those chapters in advance.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.040]   I'm gonna assume in a, unless they tell you to,
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560]   I'm gonna assume in a training like this,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.920]   the idea is they're going to give you the information
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.280]   you need during those lectures,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.080]   backstopped by the textbooks.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.680]   So it's not gonna be, we assume you know all these things,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.760]   now let's build on that in these lectures.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.960]   Most of these type of trainings
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.540]   is we're gonna be giving you the information
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.960]   from these chapters of these textbooks.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.300]   So it's probably an unnecessary investment of your time
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.600]   to read those things in advance.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.640]   The question is what you do,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.420]   what you do during the actual,
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.080]   what do you do in the actual training?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.640]   We just break something.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.840]   Off, by the way, off scenes,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.160]   Jesse just ripped the microphone off the stand.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800]   So I'm gonna say he's really mad about this training.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.440]   I think it screws in, yeah.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.480]   He's have to find a right way to turn it.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.060]   He was so mad about the idea of the security training
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.680]   that he ripped the microphone off the stand.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.880]   Look, I'm gonna switch to his camera.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.760]   He doesn't know I'm doing this.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640]   There he is trying to fix the,
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.520]   viewers of the YouTube channel can see the devastation
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.160]   Jesse has wreaked.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.000]   All right.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.440]   Anyways, Jesse's protest notwithstanding,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.360]   what I'm gonna recommend is that you approach this
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.280]   with the question resolution method
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.360]   I used to teach the college students.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   So the idea is you have all this information coming at you.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.000]   You should have printed out in advance.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.300]   If they're giving you a detailed syllabus or detailed notes,
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.780]   have that all printed out in advance
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.440]   as your guide for what you're going through.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.800]   And if you're supposed to take notes,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.180]   take notes as they're talking.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.860]   But the most important thing is to mark every topic
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.080]   for which you did not fully understand what they said.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.680]   And we have a syllabus printed out.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   You can actually just put a question mark
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.760]   next to those topics in the syllabus, incredibly efficient.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.920]   Otherwise, if you're typing notes,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.280]   you just very big, bold question mark
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.000]   or the word question in caps, this thing here.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   I didn't quite understand that.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.600]   So then when you're done with a session for the day,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.360]   you have notes on the stuff that made sense
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.880]   and you have question marks next to the stuff
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.560]   that didn't make sense.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.340]   And your goal is to fill in those questions
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.720]   as quickly as possible,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.280]   talking to the instructor, going back to the chapter.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.600]   This is what I'm always telling college kids.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.860]   The goal is making sure that you understand
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.700]   what you don't understand and you fill in that understanding
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.700]   as soon as possible.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.940]   And that's what I'm gonna recommend here.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.520]   So it's all about your capture information,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.080]   fire hose, fire hose, great.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.560]   But make sure you mark the stuff that does not make sense
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.340]   when it first comes at you.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.580]   And then as soon as possible after the lecture,
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.740]   try to fill in that gap.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.160]   Then you will come away from this training
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.640]   having at least at some point understood
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.560]   everything in the training.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   That's where you wanna be.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.440]   Now you can, if you need to study for an exam later,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.560]   you're starting from a foundation
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.100]   of having known everything.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.120]   Studying should be reviewing things you already know,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   not learning things from scratch.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.040]   You don't need to study for an exam.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.020]   You'll have a good basis in all these topics
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.320]   so that if you have to review it in the future,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.580]   again, you're starting from a foundation
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.200]   of you understood that at some point,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.400]   you're not trying to learn it from scratch.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.360]   So that's the main thing I would recommend.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.480]   And beyond that, just take it easy.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.420]   You know, eat well, drink a lot of water,
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.340]   don't do any other intellectually demanding work
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.420]   outside of those trainings during those days, rest.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.560]   I mean, make it clear that that's your primary thing
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.400]   you're doing.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.980]   (upbeat music)
