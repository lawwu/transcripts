[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   If we had AI systems that could do everything humans do to advance science and technology,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.440]   that would be insane. You know, what if we were to take the things that humans do to create new
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.920]   technologies that have transformed the planet so radically, and we were able to completely automate
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.040]   them so that every computer we have is potentially another mind working on advancing technology.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.960]   So either way you think about it, you could imagine the world changing incredibly quickly
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   and incredibly dramatically. It looks reasonably likely, in my opinion, more than 50/50,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.880]   that this century we'll see AI systems that can do all of the key tasks that humans do
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.920]   to advance science and technology. And that if that happens, we'll see explosive progress in
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   science and technology. The world will quickly become extremely different from how it is today.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.720]   You might think of it as if there was thousands of years of changes packed into a much shorter
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.560]   time period. And then if that happens, I argue that you could end up in a deeply unfamiliar future.
