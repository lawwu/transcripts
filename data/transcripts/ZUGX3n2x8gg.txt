[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   For our meditation this morning, I would call your attention to the words that are to be
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.960]   found in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 15 and verse 47. The 47th verse
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   in the 15th chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians. "The first man is of the
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.040]   earth, the second man is the Lord from heaven." Let me just read some of the surrounding verses,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:39.400]   beginning at verse 45. "So it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.560]   the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.200]   but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.280]   earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. And as is the earthy, such are they also that
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.920]   are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are also they that are heavenly. And as we have borne the
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.520]   image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly." There are many ways in which we
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.720]   can look at this message of Christmas Day. The Bible is really nothing but a great exposition
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:34.520]   of this one great event. But it seemed to me that perhaps a very fruitful way of looking at it this
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.280]   morning, in order that our thoughts may be guided today and during the whole of this season, and
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.320]   indeed God grant for the rest of our lives, would be to look at it in terms of the way in which the
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.080]   apostle puts it here in this great chapter of his on the resurrection, in which he draws his
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.920]   contrast between the two men, the first man, the second man, the first Adam, the second Adam.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.080]   What was it that happened when this babe was born at Bethlehem? Well, a very good way of
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.680]   thinking about it, the way suggested by this context, is this, that this was the beginning
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.800]   of the new creation. Now, perhaps we don't think of it along that line as much as we should do.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.320]   Our tendency is to stop with this fact in and of itself, and to think of it perhaps in terms of
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.720]   the salvation, the forgiveness of sins, and so on, that we enjoy as the result of the coming of the
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.760]   Son of God. And all that is perfectly right, and it's perfectly true. But there is a sense in which
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.280]   it rarely misses the biggest thing of all. Bethlehem, I say, is the beginning of the new
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.120]   creation. We very rightly divide our Bible into two main sections, the Old Testament,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.080]   the New Testament. Now, the Old Testament is the book in which we have an account of the first
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.160]   creation, what we may call the Old Creation. The New Testament is the book in which we have an
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.400]   account of the second creation, the new creation. And it's a very good thing, I say, to look at it
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:34.960]   all in this way. The two books, of course, deal with God's dealings with this world. That's the
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.520]   business of the Old Testament, the creation of everything in the world, and of men, and the
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.120]   story of that creation. But I want to try to show you this morning that you have exactly the same
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.520]   thing in the New. It is God again dealing with the world, but doing it now in a new way, and in a
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.720]   different way. And what I want to emphasize particularly this morning is this, that there
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:13.200]   is one big principle which is in common in the Old and the New, and that is that God always deals
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:23.080]   with the world through a man. God dealt with the old world, the old creation, through a man. Adam
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.240]   was not only the first man, he was the representative man, and the representative of
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:39.640]   men. And God dealt with mankind in and through Adam. The great point which we must grasp as we
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.800]   contemplate what happened at Bethlehem is this, that God is here producing a second man. And it
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.480]   is through this second man whom he makes the representative of a new humanity that he is now
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:04.840]   dealing with the world. So the Apostle, you see, very rightly holds up these two. The first men,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:15.360]   he says, the first man Adam was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. The
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:24.320]   first man is of the earth earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. So this is a very good
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   way of contemplating the message of Christmas Day and of Bethlehem. In the Old Testament you
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.240]   look at that first man Adam, how he came into being and what he did, what happened to him. Here
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.640]   you look at the second man. There was the first Adam, here is the last Adam. There will never be
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.400]   another. There was that first representative man, here is the last representative man. The second
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.560]   man of the last Adam. And what is so vital is for us to try to understand and to grasp what it is
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:11.080]   that God did when he sent this second man, this last Adam into the world. Now the thing that should
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.560]   make us all rejoice as Christians this morning is this very thing. The difference between the
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:27.440]   second man, the last Adam, and the first man, or the first Adam. And in this great chapter,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.640]   15th chapter of 1st Corinthians, the Apostle draws out that contrast and he does exactly the same
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:42.160]   thing in the fifth chapter of his epistle to the Romans from verse 12 to verse 21. His point is,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.840]   you see, is to show the glory of this second man and the wonder of all that has happened in him.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.480]   He puts it like this, you see, "Not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.000]   the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.800]   one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many." He keeps on repeating this, "For if by one man's
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.040]   offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:24.280]   of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. Therefore as by the offense of one judgment
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:32.600]   came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:49.640]   the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." You see, he's drawing the contrast in order to
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   show the glory of this second man, this last Adam, and his infinite superiority over that first man,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:06.800]   that first Adam. And I just want to hold this contrast before you for a few minutes this
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.640]   morning in order that we may truly be enabled to rejoice at the coming of the Son of God into this
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:24.080]   world. Now God, I say, always deals with the world through a man, through a representative man. He
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.000]   did that in the first creation, he does that in the second creation. But there's one very interesting
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.840]   thing here. I wonder whether you've ever noticed it. I don't know that it's ever come to me with
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   such force as it has on this particular occasion. God has reversed his own method. You remember the
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.960]   first. You've got the account of the creation in the first chapter of the Bible, the first chapter
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:00.120]   of the book of Genesis. And what happened there was this, that God first of all made and created
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:08.560]   a perfect world. The heavens and the earth, the vegetation and the animals, everything, he made
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:19.080]   a perfect world. Then having made a perfect world, he made a perfect man and put him into the perfect
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:29.400]   world. That was God's method in the first creation. Perfect world first, men, perfect men, put into
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:38.520]   the perfect world. But in the second creation, God has reversed the order completely. What he now has
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:48.360]   done is this. He starts the process of the second creation with the perfect man, and he's going to
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:57.280]   end by producing the perfect world. Now, one of the hymns we've sang this morning has got this point.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   It makes it in one of the verses, that 83rd hymn. Let me read it to you. "Oh, may we keep and ponder
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:12.200]   in our mind God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind. Praise we the babe who hath retrieved
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:21.520]   our loss from his poor manger to his bitter cross. Tread in his steps, assisted by his grace, till
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:32.120]   man's first heavenly state again takes place." You see, man began in a heavenly state, began in
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:39.120]   paradise, but he sinned, he rebelled, and he fell, and he brought down the chaos. Now then, the second
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   man, the last Adam, has come into this world as it is, and he's going to work in it, and we are to
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:54.040]   follow in his steps and trace them, until he shall have restored the universe to its original
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:01.960]   condition of perfection. That's the end of the new creation. There will be a new heavens and a new
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.640]   earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. And who shall dwell in it? Well, they shall dwell in it, who
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.240]   have been born of the Spirit, born of this Son of God, who are his brethren. This to me is a
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.760]   tremendous thought. In the first perfect world, men coming into it last. In the new creation, you
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:31.120]   start with the perfect man, and by him, and through him, and out of him, ultimately God is going to
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:39.080]   produce a perfect universe. All that was lost in the first is going to be retrieved and restored
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:46.120]   by the second. Very well, there is the essential difference in the process, but now let's proceed
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:57.120]   to work out this contrast between the two men. The first man is of the earth earthy, the second
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.200]   man is the Lord from heaven. What does that tell us? Well, the first thing I notice is this. There
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:15.040]   was a time when the first man was not in existence at all. We read there in that first chapter of
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:22.240]   Genesis, and God said, "Let us make man in our own image." In other words, until that point,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:33.080]   there was no man. Adam was not in existence, and at a given point, God made him. So the first
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:41.120]   man at one stage, at one point, prior to a certain point, was non-existent, and he had no being at
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:51.040]   all. But that's not true of the second man. The second man is the Lord from heaven. There never
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:59.520]   was a time when he was non-existent. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:10.040]   God, and the Word was God. He is eternal. He is the everlasting Son. There never was a time when
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.000]   he was not. Here is a mighty contrast between the two. The first man is brought into being,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:30.960]   the second man always was. He is the everlasting Lord, the eternal Word of God. And so we move to
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.880]   the second point, which is that the first man was created. That's what you get in the record. Let us
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:47.320]   make men. So he created men in his own image. Man, the first man, was a created being. The second
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:56.360]   man was not created. He is the firstborn of all creation, which means that he was born before
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.600]   anything was created. Indeed, we are told quite plainly that he is the one by whom and through
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.800]   whom all things have been created. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:16.160]   made that was made. Indeed, the Apostle Paul, in writing to the Colossians, makes it quite clear
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:25.000]   that not only is he not a created being, but that he is actually the agent of creation, and that all
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.800]   things were created for him. For by him, he says, were all things created that are in heaven, and
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.920]   that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:48.720]   or powers, all things were created by him and for him. The first man was created. The second man is
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:57.140]   the only begotten of the Father, coming out of God the Father by an eternal generation. Not a created
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:04.040]   being, but the creator and the sustainer of everything. Again, the first man is of the earth,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:11.880]   earthy. He was made of the earth. God took the earth and molded it and fashioned it and created
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:21.760]   and produced a man. He is of the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. He does
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.600]   not come up out of the earth, he comes down from heaven. He is born of a virgin's womb, a miracle
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:35.720]   is performed there in the womb of Mary, but that is not the explanation of his origin. He does not
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:45.080]   come of the earth, he comes from heaven. And then we are told about that first man, that God said,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:52.600]   "Let us make men in our own image." And the comment is added, "And so in the image and the likeness
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:16:01.720]   of God made he him." The first man is a man and nothing more. He is made of the earth, but God
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:09.080]   makes him after his own image and likeness. There is a kind of pattern which is employed for men.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:15.760]   He was not God, he was not a semi-God. He was nothing but man. But God, in order to glorify men
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.560]   and in order to give him an exalted position, put into him and upon him something of his own being
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:30.520]   and person, a kind of mark of God himself, the image and the likeness of God. Now you notice
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.200]   the terms, they are very important. He was not made God, he was made in the image and likeness
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:43.680]   of God. But the second man, the last Adam, is one of whom we can say something very different from
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:53.080]   that. He is not in the image and the likeness of God. He is the brightness of God's glory and the
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:17:00.280]   express image of his person. That is what we are told about him by the author of the epistle to
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:09.560]   the Hebrews. The brightness of the glory of God and the express image. He is God, not in the image
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:17.120]   and likeness of God, but the very image itself. The perfect expression, an everlasting expression
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:24.680]   of the perfection and the glory of the eternal God. Very well, there you see, there is this
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.160]   essential difference, as the Apostle points out, between the first men and the second men,
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.680]   the first Adam and the last Adam. And then I want to emphasize something which to me is very
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:44.640]   wonderful. As I have already told you, that first man was put into a perfect world. God made
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.520]   everything and he looked at it and he saw that it was good. There was no defect, there was no
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:55.200]   blemish, there was nothing wrong in that original creation. There were no thorns, there were no
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.960]   brows, there were no pestilences, there were no diseases, there were no sin, there was no sorrow,
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.680]   there was no shame, there was no sighing, there were no tears. It was paradise, it was absolute
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:22.880]   perfection. And when God made the first man, he put him into that perfect world. But do we realize
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:32.440]   the kind of world into which the second man came? He didn't come into a perfect world. And this is
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.520]   one of the most amazing paradoxes of the incarnation and of the message of Christmas
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:48.400]   and of Bethlehem. He came into a sinful world. The poet has seen it, O loving wisdom of our God,
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:19:00.440]   when all was sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight and to the conflict came. He didn't come
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:07.480]   into paradise, he came into a stable, born amongst the animals and the straw, with all the selfishness
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.240]   of the people who wouldn't give up their rooms in the inn. That's the sort of world he came into.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   He came into a world such as you and I know today, a world of war and of rivalry, jealousy, envy,
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:23.800]   malice, spite, wickedness, hatred, all that is so true of the life of men in this world. The
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:30.440]   second man came into such a world, what a contrast. He didn't come into paradise and into
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:38.880]   perfection. He came into the world such as you and I know it to be, and such as men has made it to
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.080]   be. And the first man you see placed in paradise, he didn't have any work to do, he simply took of
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:51.680]   the fruit and he ate it. He didn't have to work in order to get his food, it was there provided
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:58.480]   for him, he just had to enjoy it and to enjoy the fellowship of God. The second man came into the
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:04.840]   world as I've described it and he had to work, he was a carpenter. He had to work by the sweat of
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:13.880]   his brow to earn a living and to obtain his bread. You see, we are full of this contrast everywhere.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:20.600]   But the thing that the apostle emphasizes most of all and the thing that we want to grasp is this,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:28.760]   is the contrast in what the two men did. There is this first man made in the image and likeness of
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.560]   God, put into paradise, into a perfect world, not having any need to work or to do anything but just
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:41.160]   to enjoy the companionship of God and of heaven and to enjoy the fruit of God's glorious creation.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:48.920]   But what happened? Well, it's all there in those contrasts in Romans 5, 12 to 21. He disobeyed,
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:58.280]   he rebelled. He was tempted of course, he was tempted of the devil and he listened to the
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:05.240]   temptation of the devil. And he rebelled against God, he believed the lie of the devil against God,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:12.760]   he became guilty of disobedience and of transgression. The first man failed, he was a
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:19.240]   failure. Though he'd been made perfect and in the image and likeness of God and that perfection
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:25.480]   grounded about him, he failed and he failed miserably and lamentably. He was guilty of an
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:34.080]   offense, the offense being rebellion of God and transgression of his holy law. And thus,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:42.840]   he became guilty of sin and he became a sinner. He became a man into whom a twist entered,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:50.440]   he became a pervert, he became an enemy of God and he became miserable and unhappy.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:22:01.040]   And not only that, as the Apostle tells us, he made all his progeny sinners. By one man,
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   sin entered into the world and so death came upon all men for that all sin. Now there is the record
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:16.720]   of the first man and that is why the first creation went wrong. That's why the world became
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.600]   what it has become and that is why God never sent his Son into the world. And that is why the Son
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:29.880]   said, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost." It is because of this first
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:38.160]   man's failure that Bethlehem ever became necessary. And it's here we see this wonderful contrast.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:45.240]   The first man is of the earth, the second man is the Lord from heaven. What do we find in him?
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.640]   Well, you have nothing but a record of perfect, absolute obedience. He was also tempted,
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:23:01.240]   tempted in all points like as we are. The devil came and tempted him, not only in the temptations
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.160]   in the wilderness, but he tempted him after that many times. He left him then for a season,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.840]   he followed him, he followed him all through his life. He met the full power of the temptation of
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:24.160]   the devil and evil and hell and yet he triumphed. Tempted in all points like as we are, yet without
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:31.240]   sin. Sin apart. He never listened to the insinuations. He turned upon the devil and he
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:37.200]   said, "Get thee behind me, Satan." He mastered him, he conquered him, he bound the strong man
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.640]   and he was victorious over all the insinuations and the attacks of the devil. Not only that,
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:50.600]   he rendered a perfect obedience unto the law of God and to his father's will. He said he had come
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:57.120]   to do his father's will, but he wasn't concerned about his own glory. He says he's come to glorify
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.360]   God and he did. The words that he spoke, he spoke not of himself. He spoke the words that the father
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.180]   had given him and he says, "The works that I do, I do not of myself." The father had given him the
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:16.160]   works and he rendered a perfect, absolute obedience to the will of God. He was obedient even unto
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:25.200]   death, yea, the death of the cross. He never failed in one point or in one jot or tittle of the law.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:36.440]   And so he lived an absolutely perfect, righteous, holy life, entirely satisfactory, so that God
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:45.320]   spoke from him on three occasions and said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:57.080]   Perfect obedience, absolute righteousness, defeat and conquest of the devil. And the result you see
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.040]   is this, as the apostle puts it there in his contrast, "The first man failed, he became unrighteous
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.280]   himself and he made us unrighteous. We are all born in sin and shapen in iniquity. There has
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:16.520]   never been a perfect man since Adam fell. All men have fallen with him and we're all born imperfect.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.720]   There is sin in us by nature. We are all by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   That's what the first man did for us. But you know what the second man has done? Listen to Paul again
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.840]   putting it in Romans 8, 3 and 4, "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:45.320]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh,
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   in order that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:00.280]   but after the Spirit." Or as you've got it there in these great contrasts in Romans 5, the apostle
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:07.320]   says, "As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:14.920]   many be made righteous." You see it's a contrast all along the line from the very beginning to the
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:22.560]   very end. And of course the first man because of his transgression and disobedience and rebellion
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:29.440]   and sin and failure has not only made us sinners and not only made us unrighteous, he's brought us
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:37.800]   under the judgment of God. We are all by nature under the judgment of God. We are all the children
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:46.600]   of wrath, even as others. But you know this second man, he was able to say this, and this is why he
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.720]   came, he said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believeth on him that
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:01.240]   sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into judgment or condemnation, but is passed from
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   death unto life." The first man brought us under judgment, under condemnation, but in the name of
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.760]   the second man we are able to say, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:24.560]   Christ Jesus." No condemnation. We are finished with it. He's borne the punishment. He's taken us
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.120]   out through the judgment. He's passed through it for us. There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:37.480]   to them that are in Christ Jesus. Delivered from the law, delivered from the wrath of God against
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:48.600]   sin, no fear of the judgment, no fear of hell and of perdition. And of course, the end of the
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:56.680]   trouble that the first man brought upon us was this. He brought in fear, he brought in misery,
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:03.320]   he brought in unhappiness. And the world has been full of that sort of thing ever since.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.760]   But look at this second man. Just under the shadow of his own death and cross he's able to say,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:16.600]   "Peace I give unto you, my peace give I unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:23.120]   your hearts be troubled, neither let they be afraid." He says he's got a joy to give, which
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:29.200]   the world cannot give or ever take away. And this is what he's done. Peace with God, peace with men,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   peace within, and a joy unspeakable and full of glory. But the ultimate effect of the first
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:48.640]   man's failure is the most terrible thing that's ever happened in God's universe, and that is death.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:56.080]   The first man need never have died. He had the possibility in him of never dying. If he had only
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.640]   obeyed God's law and had gone on in fellowship and communion with God, he would have been given
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.200]   the gift of immortality. It was possible for him not to die, but he sinned, and the wages of sin
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:16.000]   is death. So as the Apostle puts it, "For as by one man sin came into the world, and death by sin,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.480]   he brought in death." What of this second man? Well of course as you know it is the great theme
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.520]   of this 15th chapter of 1st Corinthians, but listen to our Lord himself putting it. He says,
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:37.520]   "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." Listen,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:45.720]   he says at the very grave of Lazarus, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:53.800]   me, though he were dead yet shall he live, and he that believeth in me shall never die." The
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:02.640]   first man, death. Second man, resurrection. Life, which is life indeed, life which is life eternal.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:11.680]   And so looking at this second man, we are able to say this. This corruptible body of ours must
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.960]   put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this incorruptible shall
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.400]   have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:31.360]   to pass the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory." Oh death, where is thy
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.720]   sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:48.920]   law. But thanks be unto God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:56.800]   This second man has entirely undone all the work of the first and infinitely more,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:06.480]   and he has brought life and immortality to light through his gospel. And he is the firstborn of
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.840]   many brethren. He is the head of a new humanity, and all who believe in him no longer belong to
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.320]   that first man, that first Adam. They belong to the second man, the last Adam. They become
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.760]   partakers of the divine nature. They become the children of God, and he will go on working in
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.480]   them until they are absolutely perfect, until there is no spot, no wrinkle, nor any such thing
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:36.920]   belonging to them. And so Paul is able to say to the Philippians that our citizenship is in heaven,
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:43.520]   from whence also we look for and expect the Savior, who shall change this, our vile body,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:50.120]   that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to that mighty working whereby
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:56.840]   he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. In this babe of Bethlehem, God has not only
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.640]   produced a second perfect man, the Lord, from hidden, in and through him he is making a new
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:10.320]   race of men. And we shall finally be perfect. And then this Son of God will come back again,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:18.000]   and he will destroy all his enemies. He will purge the whole cosmos of evil and sin,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.880]   and there shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. And you and I who
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:36.680]   believe in this second man, this last Adam, the Lord from hidden, shall dwell with him in that
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:48.240]   restored, perfected, regenerated cosmos. And we shall reign with him, and we shall enjoy with
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:57.120]   him his everlasting glory. Very well, my friends, that is what was happening in Bethlehem. This is
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:03.920]   the first move in the new creation. You start now, you see, with a man, and out of this man you
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.560]   produce the progeny, the family, the children of God. And then at the end, when the entire
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.880]   company is gathered, the elect from everywhere, the fullness of the Jews, the fullness of the
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:27.880]   Gentiles, then the perfect world will be restored and made anew for God's perfect people. And sin
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:34.240]   and sorrow and sighing shall be no more. There shall be no weeping. There shall be no hunger
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:51.000]   nor thirst. It will be glory, unmixed and forever. And it all will happen because God sent the
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:03.440]   second man, the last Adam, his only begotten, dearly beloved son, into the world as the babe
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   of Bethlehem. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. Well, let us sing to his praise
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:24.000]   this great hymn of Charles Wesley, hymn number 84. Hark! the herald angels sing,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.720]   Glory to the new-born King. Hymn number 84.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   Hark! the herald angels sing, Glory to the new-born King.
