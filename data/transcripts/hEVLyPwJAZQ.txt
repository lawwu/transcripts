[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   sacks is there something you object to here the poker one and net worth no i mean it's fine i
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.280]   don't give a about longevity or quantum computing but here's the good news david it's not all about
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.280]   you there's four people you could have two people who like the topic and then you could just ask
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.960]   them a probing that's fine it's fine just tell me when it's over i'll do you know
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:29.840]   let your winners ride brain man david sacks
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:47.120]   hey everybody hey everybody welcome to the all in podcast i'm jason calacanis and with us today
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.800]   again the queen of quinoa david friedberg sans his dog in the background sorry for those of you who
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.680]   love his dog he's on a walk he'll be back in like 10 he'll be back and he'll be in the seat uh
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.600]   and the rain man himself david sacks ultra focused on sas and marketplace startups
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.920]   and involved in some illegal trafficking of red pills straight up from honduras to cuba and then
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.320]   through miami making the red pills making their way to california and finally daddy's back
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.040]   the spac master himself bestie c the dictator
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.440]   is replenished bank account replenished he's been re-billionized firing on all cylinders
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   oh it's so so you know live by the spac die by the smack that's what they always say in
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.520]   this business but you know what we have been absolutely inundated with i kid you not hundreds
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.200]   of questions from you our loyal audience and when this thing is over we are going on world tour
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   we'll see you in vegas we'll see you uh in uh at the royal albert hall in uh london and we're going
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.280]   be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.280]   uh in uh at the royal albert hall in uh london and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.400]   uh in uh at the royal albert hall in uh london and miami all cities are on the agenda let's take our
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.240]   first question from you the audience to what extent are you guys wait how's everyone doing
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.760]   i thought we didn't see the questions but how's our i mean look at this guy he got his ass kicked
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.240]   and he's back i'm doing really really great what about the rest of you guys you guys played poker
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.200]   this week we played poker it was a bloodbath well although you know it's so funny because like we
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.040]   played i played uh
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.920]   uh a very big game the week before and then we step into our game which is like i think still
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.720]   quite big but i could not rub two cards together to make a hand and i uh i went off like a rocket
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.080]   ship i just lost it somewhere along the way and just despite that despite that every time i chamath
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.960]   and i were heads up at hand he just smashed absolutely smashed me smashed and then i was like
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400]   you know what i'm not going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.800]   each time uh i was down i didn't know that i was going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   uh i was down i didn't know that i was going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   uh i was down i didn't know that i was going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.240]   uh i was down i did check out i did run you over i mean the number of just complete bluffs i ran on you oh
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.680]   that's crazy and i'm just like he's totally got my number tonight after bluff after bluff
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000]   and then i showed him the nuts five times in a row it was beautiful so i'm stuck a model y
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.320]   and i come back and i win a used prius i'm just leaving it at that
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   i lost a mid-sized home in phoenix arizona i think you lost a betley okay don't cancel us
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.880]   uh please uh sax jack did you play i wasn't there in that game but i played in uh la game a couple of
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.080]   nights ago and uh any celebrities yeah me me sax and oh god you guys don't count your podcasters
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.280]   no there was one there was one unnamed celebrity we can't say what what an actor no we can't say
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.920]   but we all won well just give us a genre i mean an athlete okay yeah i won in in that game but i lost
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.520]   uh i lost a different game this past week and it wasn't pretty
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.720]   yeah wait sexy sexy are you what game you're playing yeah i think he may be playing actually
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.680]   i mean beep that out would you nick beep it out but we can all laugh at him for being so precious
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.800]   oh you i'm sorry do you lps think you're supposed to be in san francisco investing in startups no
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.640]   no they know i go wherever the deals are oh really miami what are you gonna do would you get a deal
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.280]   on some croquettes and a cuban sandwich two for one there's no copies there when do you think
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.880]   you'll make an investment in a miami-based company you think that'll happen anytime it's happened
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.920]   already that's what happened are you in the new free are you in the new reboy i've invested in
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.240]   a miami company i've got like six yeah i well there's some companies that are moving to miami
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.520]   that i'm already in you know chamath and i are both in pipe right and and uh part at least the
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   ceo of the company just moved to miami so that's two of four two or four besties in pipe thanks
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.120]   by the way how did you miss that jcal they they advertise on your show and you didn't think to try
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.280]   and invest that the lp beep that we all share wanted everything and he couldn't fit me in and
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.320]   i was like how about a slice and he's like is that lp me no there's another lp that sax and i share
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.600]   who got their beak significantly doused in that one but i'm just gonna i'm gonna get the kid to
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.720]   give me a 25 basis points in uh advisor share so i'm getting a slice no matter what yeah good good
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.080]   luck with that good luck with that good luck the trains off the station the trains off the station
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   dude that that that company's worth a couple billion dollars in less than two years of its
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.880]   existence good luck with that jason okay well it's i we call it a make good i don't know what you guys
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.400]   are seeing but my god early stage valuations went bonkers i had one company that raised
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.440]   that that was looking at run it i have all kinds of data okay right so today we're going to do
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.800]   some audience questions and then we're going to do the state of vc we're running through a deck
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.280]   we're running through everything that is changing right now in venture capital and early stage
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.240]   investing and it is changing very quickly here's a question what's the best way to get a good deal
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   on a company that's going to make a lot of money in the future and what's the best way to get a good
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.280]   deal on a company that's going to make a lot of money in the future and what's the best way to get a good deal
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:57.800]   here's a question from leonard uh omazix to what extent are you guys interested in longevity
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120]   in your opinion what technologies could help us live longer and healthier lives friedberg
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.440]   that's got your name on it why don't we start with you um on this one i would uh point folks
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.040]   to read the book lifespan by david sinclair who's a researcher at harvard and he's done
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.160]   a lot of kind of leading work on um on uh basically calling aging a
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.800]   disease and life extension so the book lifespan highlights i think a lot of his research and
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:32.840]   findings and paths forward uh for um for improving uh longevity and basically you know comes down to
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.000]   what he defines as kind of an early switch that evolved in evolutionary biology
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.920]   in every cell on every living organism where the cell is either in growth mode or repair mode
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.440]   and the trick is can you get the gene to switch on that puts the cell into repair mode and if you do
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.040]   that you're going to have a lot of problems with that and so i think that's a really good point and
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.120]   i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.240]   and i think that's a really good point the cell fixes itself and you and the cell lasts longer
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   the cell fixes itself and you and the cell lasts longer
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.600]   the cell fixes itself and you and the cell lasts longer the organism lives longer
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.760]   the organism lives longer and so they've identified a number of
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   and so they've identified a number of
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   and so they've identified a number of genes that trigger this and a number of
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   genes that trigger this and a number of
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.600]   genes that trigger this and a number of compounds that trigger expression of
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   compounds that trigger expression of
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.120]   compounds that trigger expression of those genes
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   those genes
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.240]   those genes and there's a number of things you can
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.240]   and there's a number of things you can
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.560]   and there's a number of things you can do lifestyle wise to trigger these genes
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   do lifestyle wise to trigger these genes
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.400]   basically to get yourself to live longer so fasting is a good one and then there's a bunch
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   of compounds that you can take that mimic fasting on a cellular level like metformin and rapamycin
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.640]   i'm on metformin i think a couple of you guys are on metformin right yeah and then and then
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:26.240]   the nad plus supplements um which you can buy you take m nmn substance yeah nmn nmn and nad plus um
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:34.720]   so there's two there's two compounds nmn like nancy mike nancy um and then nr um and those uh
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.200]   you can buy a product called true niagen on amazon which which has those compounds and you take about
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.480]   a thousand milligrams a day and um anyway all of this stuff's laid out in his books and it supports
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.640]   a lot of the research that's being done obviously fasting and exercise also trigger this gene
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.560]   expression and enable kind of measures of longevity uh to kind of be showing up biologically
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.160]   but um i think i think it's a
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.760]   it's an emerging field and there's a lot of deep work going on and as people have highlighted the
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.160]   process of aging is a biological process that theoretically we can stop and potentially reverse
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.120]   and there's a lot of new work that's being done in stem cell therapy that may kind of
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.600]   elicit some new paths forward here so arguably someone is alive on planet earth today that
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.960]   could live past the age of 200. um so it's an exciting field and lots of kind of paths forward
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.200]   i'll uh i'll tell you for what it's worth my regimen
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.520]   um
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.720]   and oh god here we go thirst trap photo coming in no uh so so i i do uh
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:43.200]   the the following so um i take uh a statin now it was 10 milligrams now i'm at 20 milligrams
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.040]   um i take metformin and all of this i take sort of in a preventative posture
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.640]   um because my cholesterol wasn't super high but it wasn't super low it was like sort of like in the
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.760]   160 170 180 but now it's sort of like 120. um and then metformin i take preventatively as well i'm
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.120]   not pre-diabetic um and then a couple of vitamin d and some other stuff but then here are these things
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.760]   that i do that i think could be valuable for some folks listening uh there are these places now that
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:20.960]   exist they're popping up one company that you can check out is called pre-nuvo p-r-e-n-u-v-o
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:28.080]   um they're in vancouver they're in la they're in redwood city so mid peninsula for those in silicon
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:35.760]   valley and what you can do is you can get a head to toe uh mri so you know there's no radiation you
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.840]   know you could do these things you know every other week if you wanted to it takes about an hour
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.480]   and what happens is they can basically uh look through your entire body
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.960]   um your musculature your organs um from the literally from the tip of your head all the
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.360]   way down to your ankles and they can spot a lot of stuff that may not otherwise uh be seen and so you
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.080]   know every three or four years to get one of these scans you could see a lesion um you could see the
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.600]   beginnings of a tumor um you know i did one a few weeks ago touchwood it was great nothing nothing
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.840]   so much does it cost um there's a range of prices um and i think those prices will come down the
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.120]   range of prices are from like 1500 to 2500 so it's not expense it's not cheap sorry
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.480]   but here's what they're able to do they're building a corpus of all these images where
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.880]   they're running uh machine learning on it and they're getting better and better at identifying
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.600]   anomalies and so as a result of that they're able to actually take the mri images and they
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.000]   can do fewer and fewer scans to get the equivalent resolution so two things will
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.640]   happen one is the scan time will come down right so it was an hour and a half now it's sort of right
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.520]   under an hour it can probably be as low as 40 minutes which is relatively tolerable for most
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.240]   people and then the cost will come down into the hundreds of dollars because you'll be able to very
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.920]   rapidly assess um so i do that and then the second thing is for anybody with heart disease in their
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.040]   family i really implore you one of my friends actually is flying down from toronto i'm taking
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.880]   him to my cardiologist in la and there's a thing called heart flow and what heart flow is is a
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.560]   contrast ct which basically means they inject it into the heart and they're able to get the heart
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:19.040]   to die and then they put you under a ct and they they map out your heart and you can literally see
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.320]   the calcium build up you can see the state of your arteries um and you know what probably people don't
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.800]   know is when you have a calcium score you know most of us it's zero but when it starts to be
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.760]   non-zero it doubles every year and by the time it gets into the thousands you're basically
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.960]   guaranteed to get some form of cardiac issue um and so it doesn't seem like anything if your
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.480]   cardiac score is 20 except it goes to 40 80 once a year and then you're like oh my god i'm gonna die
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.160]   60 and all of a sudden within five six years you're really in the red zone for a heart attack
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.920]   or something um i've done it twice now um every five years i do it um and touch wood you know my
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.360]   my calcium score is still zero um but in any event uh that's what i do for longevity i kind
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.000]   of preventatively at the cellular level with some drugs and then just trying to catch cancer
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.080]   and heart disease on the front end otherwise eat three balanced meals and exercise and sleep a lot
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.880]   sax uh you obviously don't care about longevity
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.880]   uh any thoughts here i mean sax has looked like he's a thousand years old since he was seven no
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.680]   he was when he was in 12th grade he looked like he was a vice president united states yeah guys
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.720]   just just let just let me know when this conversation is over i've been doing my email
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:36.000]   oh that's so great all right here we go end my life now i hate it you don't you guys
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.320]   like i just lost two years right now sax has got an early spot both on the
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:49.360]   rocket ship to mars and he's got an inside vip to peter thiel's blood boy project and so either way
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.160]   he's getting off the planet or he's going to refresh his blood or both so he's good
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.520]   all right action bias asks please debate decentralization of monetary
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.960]   value ultimate threat for insider's power erosion i interpret this as a as a bitcoin question so
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.240]   yeah i think one of the most interesting things happening in the world today is
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.280]   is this is what's happening with bitcoin right it's and and you're seeing the price go up because
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.400]   a bunch of institutional investors on wall street are all getting into it now
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.320]   it's gone from retail to institutional and the narrative basically it's a really profound
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   narrative which is it's the separation of money and state so if you think about like one of the
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.360]   most important events in human history was the separation of church and state where we no longer
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.160]   look to the state to determine you know what religion everyone was going to be well
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.960]   what crypto is introducing is this idea that the government cannot control the money supply
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.600]   i think that's what he's talking about with the decentralization is that you could have a currency
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.840]   that everybody in the world believes in that no government can control
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.120]   that's the separation of money and state now this is just really a narrative right now
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   um i mean and who knows if it will actually come true but the interesting thing is that
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.080]   if everybody does believe in it it will come true and so bitcoin's been sort of described as the bub
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.160]   that never ends because if everyone kind of buys into this bubble it actually comes true so i think
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:25.120]   it's very interesting and you're seeing um because bitcoin is kind of perceived as the antidote to
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.000]   inflation and money printing by the government uh i think you're seeing it take on new urgency
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.800]   now because the government just keeps printing trillions and trillions of dollars of of new money
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.000]   doesn't this threaten government so if government um doesn't have control over monitoring financial
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.560]   transactions and have control over the accounts in which the financial assets sit which is
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.920]   effectively the notion of decentralized anonymized wallets then um how does the
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.040]   government secure taxation which is requisite for their ability to fund well the good the
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.200]   fund the state right and so what happens to the state well so there's an enormous amount
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.720]   of leakage that happens today in assets that actually get financialized but in the gray market
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.920]   and i think the the beautiful thing is on the one hand you know we become less focused on like the m
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.720]   one and the m2 money supply like the physical printable distributable money that we can see
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.120]   and touch and it gets replaced with virtual currencies that are tied to other things
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.280]   i think what the the the the person who wrote the question is asking really is more about
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.520]   d5 and what's happening sort of like on the ethereum you know 2.0 erc20 contracts all that
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.560]   stuff which is sort of much more next gen i think than bitcoin and i think at some point we should
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.840]   deep dive into it but what i would say friedberg is all the leakage you have today goes away in a
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.920]   world of d5 because you will financialize every single asset possible you know you'll
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.720]   financialize your homes you'll financialize your cars your watches your jewelry your art
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.280]   you'll financialize every random thing maybe even your career and how people will trade it
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.960]   absolutely your career and and the thing is by by monetizing it and financializing it you can
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   borrow against it you can trade it you can pull forward value into the future against it but it'll
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.760]   all be tracked and so as long as a government then says listen you're going to have to do this
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.520]   listen we're going to enable it all but there needs to be an off-ramp to taxation and that's
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.840]   pretty simple because a physical house exists in the world you can't hide the existence of a
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.960]   physical house but it's not anonymized right and so i you know if you want to track it i mean that's
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.040]   the challenge if no i'm saying if it is anonymized then the government can't track it and the
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.880]   government can't these are these are two separate things some assets will live anonymously and those
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.680]   are the assets that don't need to exist in the real world but i think what this will create
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.880]   is a world where all of these assets that actually truly exist in the real world it'll be fine that it
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.520]   exists and that people get taxed on it but it'll be much more legitimate and i think it'll be
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.280]   simpler and so i think people will trade off incremental taxation for incremental monetizability
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:05.040]   i'll give you an example let's use real estate there is no reason why every single piece of land
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.600]   everywhere around the world isn't written into a ledger with knowledge of who owns it
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.160]   such that the person that owns it could trade it could borrow against it um could sell it
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.800]   um fractionalize it fractionalize it even if you can't fractionalize in the real world because your
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.000]   neighbors won't let you set it up into four lots you could do that online online and so today what
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.680]   will happen is that you know that person has a level of wealth and what they do instead take the
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.880]   united states is they lobby lobby lobby to create all this convoluted real estate tax law to make
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.520]   their life simpler but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.960]   and you're going to have a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.280]   going to have a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.080]   a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.000]   to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money to spend but
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.640]   if you judge just to you know sort of answer the question here from the from the reader from the
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.600]   listener i think you can really judge this based upon how much it's being pumped by the people who
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.240]   own it and they are absolutely dogged religious about this it's like talking to and you know a
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.440]   person who's you know met jesus and now everybody has to be a christian and you can also look at
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.400]   the people who are opposing it i don't know if you saw yellen um and then um christine lagarde
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.120]   she came out against it yellen's come out against it india might ban it and then you have obviously
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.840]   china's coming out their digital one so i think it's going to be there's going to be a dogfight
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.160]   here where governments are not going to easily give up their control of this and there's many
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.800]   ways they can make a bunch of red tape to slow this down and in countries that are
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.360]   authoritarian they cannot write ban it let's take another question
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   here by the way there's like three outcomes here right i mean you could either see bitcoin for
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.520]   example you know being banned and that's going to be ugly um and obviously there would be significant
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.160]   financial loss at this point i mean to sax's point at some point there's so much asset value tied up
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.840]   in bitcoin it's it's too big to fail so david banned by who oh that that's chinese government
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.600]   this is what they're trying to do on some of the states right and they're trying to make it illegal
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.640]   for citizens to transfer money in and out of the asset class i think it's a bigger threat to
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:18.000]   want to impose export or currency controls and and export restrictions but but frankly if you're
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.600]   a country that's not afraid of currency movements because you're not trying to do something
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.080]   oppressive to your people i don't think you have that much to fear here i mean there are other ways
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.360]   of trying to hide assets or hide money besides bitcoin and every transaction every bitcoin
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.440]   transaction is written into the ledger i think you have to be pretty dumb to try and commit a
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.600]   crime with bitcoin because there's going to be a permanent record in the blockchain forever
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.200]   of that transfer and then there's companies that are going to be able to do that and then there's
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:48.800]   companies that that provide uh that do kind of sleuthing and try to you know unravel you think
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.840]   tax evasion in the united states is going to be difficult um with bitcoin if i accrue a bunch of
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.240]   value in bitcoin am i going to be able to evade paying taxes on those gains and convert that
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.840]   bitcoin into physical assets by purchasing it from another bitcoin wallet holder i mean how
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.920]   realistic is tax evasion going to be uh and how much would because that's ultimately what
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.120]   the us government would mostly well so you would convert cash into
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.640]   bitcoin and then you want to sell your bitcoin at some point you're going to have to sell it
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.120]   i mean there would be a there'd be a a realization of it i'm saying transfer to a seller of an asset
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.920]   of another asset that's willing to accept bitcoin in receipt and so two anonymized wallets i don't
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.000]   know i mean that that transaction is going to live on the blockchain forever and it's going to live
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.960]   in the books of whoever the seller is what are they selling you a car a house whatever i mean
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.760]   that that trans a watch i mean look if it's a personal item maybe but if we're talking about a
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.040]   substantial asset i mean if it's a personal item maybe but if we're talking about a substantial asset
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.160]   like a house or a company or something they're going to need to the other side of the transaction
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.520]   is going to need to report the realization event so you're going to have to have two people collude to
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.560]   engage in tax evasion seems like a really stupid thing to do legally incorporated businesses are
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.800]   going to be mandated to do effectively identity verification much like we have to do under the
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   patriot act with all the the financial laws totally totally yeah ultimately how the compromise
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.960]   arises right yeah i'm not i i'm not that worried about i i feel like this whole like
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:18.400]   silk road type bitcoin will be used illegally thing is like kind of a old meme about it that
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.600]   i think that the fears are like greatly exaggerated but the thing that jumps out at me about all the
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.920]   critics of bitcoin and i'm not like a pump or whatever but i do i do own some um is the thing
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.240]   that like all these like critics don't seem to understand is the technology that's the common
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   denominator whether it's like howard marx or warren buffett or charlie munger or whoever
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.880]   they're they're all like great investors or whatever but they're not technically
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.480]   technologists it's a blind spot and the thing they don't understand about the technology is that
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.760]   bitcoin is the first digital asset to ever be created that you can't create infinite copies
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:58.400]   of right so think about like a song or a photo or a video or whatever anything that's digital
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.080]   you've always been able to make an infinite number of copies isn't that what the word
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.040]   digital means is that it's infinitely copyable so how do you have digital money
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.800]   that can't just be infinitely copied obviously that would destroy the value and that's
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.280]   what's happening with bitcoin right now bitcoin is a digital asset to every transaction and
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.880]   that's why bitcoin is so important because it's a digital asset to every transaction
