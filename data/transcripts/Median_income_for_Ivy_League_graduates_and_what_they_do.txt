[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode I want to talk about the median income earned by Ivy League graduates and
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.940]   what they all do or what most of them do after graduating.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.280]   I am a parent of a six-year-old and a three-year-old, so I am fascinated with the topic of college right now.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.880]   It seems so far away, but it's really not.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.280]   12 years and then my son goes off. Maybe if he does go, right? And I've already calculated worst-case scenario
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.160]   $3,000 for four years based on an inflation rate of about 5% a year
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.580]   based on all-in cost of a four-year private university of about
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.540]   $350,000 a year in 2023. The math doesn't lie. It sounds crazy, but hey
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.280]   that's why we save and invest for the future as well. So in true Financial Samurai fashion,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.640]   I'm trying to figure out whether the means justify the ends and the ends is I guess status, prestige,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600]   but really objectively income and
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.960]   what they do because I want to figure out whether I
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.080]   need to push my kids hard over the next 12 to 15 years or let them have fun in grade school.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:23.000]   Enjoy life, you know be like maybe the typical American parent, not the typical Asian parent or the European parent who just pushes their kids
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.680]   in education so hard.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.760]   So what's the point of it all? The point of it all is to earn enough to live a comfortable life and do what you enjoy
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.320]   doing, doing what you want that provides meaning and purpose. This is what the fire movement is all about.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.900]   We've got one life to live. We might as well make the most of it.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.320]   So here is the data according to the Department of Education scorecard.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   Former Ivy League attendees who received federal aid earn a median of about
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.800]   90,500 a decade after starting school or getting that aid. So that could be
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.880]   anywhere from six years to eight years after graduation, which would put them at around age 28 to 30 years old.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.160]   Does 90,500 sound like an impressive income to you as a 28 to
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.520]   30, 31 year old? It's okay. It's not bad, but it's not blowing my socks off.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.920]   I thought it would be higher because an Ivy League school is a top 20 school and there's around
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.080]   4,000 universities in the country. So that's like what top three,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.240]   0.375% top half percent. So if you go to a top half a percent school, you would think logically,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.440]   well, I expect a top 1% income for my age group, not a top 25% income, which is what
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.100]   9,500 is. Based on data from professors Guvenan, Kaplan, and Song from 2014 and me
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.800]   inflation adjusting this data, a
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.680]   top 1% income for the 27 to 31 year old age group is about
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.640]   $222,000 today in 2023. And for the 32 to 36 year old age group, it's about
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.240]   $274,000. And if we talk about overall top 1% income threshold,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.240]   that's about $500,000 and up. And if we talk about top 0.1% income earners by age,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.520]   we're talking in the 27 to 31 year age group,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.040]   closer to about
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.840]   $350,000. And then overall a top 0.1% income, the minimum threshold is a million dollars.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.080]   So the gap is huge compared to the median income earned by Ivy League graduates who have federal
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.360]   student loans. If you want to know which Ivy League University pays the most 10 years after
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.160]   attendance, then the number one is University of Pennsylvania with a median earnings of
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.680]   $103,246 with an average annual cost of
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.760]   $25,046. Number two is Princeton University,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.960]   $95,689, average annual cost
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.200]   $9,836. That's some pretty darn good financial aid.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.520]   Number three, Dartmouth at $91,627, average annual cost
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.160]   $32,410. That's way more expensive than Princeton. Number four, Cornell,
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.960]   $91,176, median earnings 10 years after attendance, average annual cost
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.000]   $37,000, even more expensive.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.800]   Columbia University, surprisingly only at
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.320]   $89,871, average annual cost
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.080]   $89,823, and I say surprising because it's in New York City. Then there's Yale.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.840]   Harvard is at
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.440]   $84,918, average annual cost of $13,872. And then finally the bottom, Brown University,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   $78,943 of median earnings 10 years after attendance, and then average annual cost of
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.320]   $29,544. So just eyeballing this list, I would think, hmm, going to Harvard, only
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.720]   $1,872, or Yale at $15,000, or
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.120]   better yet, Princeton at only $9,836?
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:24.040]   Sounds like the best deal to me. Just be aware that the median earnings numbers are for students who took out
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.720]   federal student aid. So students and families who were able to pay for college without the need for federal financial aid
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.200]   were not included and probably earn a greater median income
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.640]   5, 10, 15 years out because, well, they're wealthier and wealthier people have more connections, and
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.400]   that's just the way life is in society. I was feeling a little bit
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.960]   unsatisfied with the data by the college scorecard from the Department of Education.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:01.000]   $90,500, 10 years after attending, just doesn't sound high enough for me or my kids
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.920]   to push so hard to try to get into a school that rejects
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.880]   95% of its applicants. I just start thinking about, wow, we could just really relax over the next 12 to 15 years
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.400]   while the kids are in grade school. We can travel, we can just enjoy life to the max, instead of feeling all stressed out
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.280]   about creating a "WonderKid" kind of resume that cures cancer and
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.000]   eradicates malaria in, you know, Western Africa.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.200]   It's just so, it just seems mind-boggling what kids need to do nowadays to get into a top school.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.800]   So I looked further and I found more information from US News and World Report and PayScale
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.000]   that paints a clearer picture about pay differences. They say
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.800]   early career, which means three years of work experience, the median pay in 2022 was
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.560]   $86,025 for Ivy League graduates. Not bad.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.160]   Compared to $58,643 for those who graduated from other universities.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   That's a 47% pay difference, which is significant.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.480]   By mid-career, which is defined as 20 years of work experience, median pay in
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.240]   2022 was
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.120]   $161,888 for Ivy League graduates, compared to only
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.640]   $101,777 for those from other institutions.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.440]   So a $60,111 a year difference in gross annual pay, that's 59%.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.960]   That's, that's very significant. I think that's massive. So now I'm thinking to myself,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.120]   "Okay, $161,888 when the kids are around 40 to 42 years old.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.600]   Hmm, don't have to worry about them." And then, if they marry a fellow
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   Ivy League graduate, then that's
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.680]   $123,000 a year. And voila! They hit that magical
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:04.080]   $300,000 household income figure that I've written about that might be required to live a relatively
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.160]   middle to upper middle class lifestyle in a big expensive city if you have a couple children.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.320]   Just look at the tax rates, look at the budget line items. The numbers don't lie. Given this is a financial podcast,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.880]   I think one of the conclusions to make if you were to attend an Ivy League school or a school that's similar,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.240]   similarly expensive and similarly ranked, then your goal is to increase your return on investment by
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.680]   working as long as possible post-graduation. This means
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.080]   forsaking, for example, the FIRE movement, which talks about retiring as soon as possible
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.640]   so you can do something else or kick back and relax or take care of your family.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.800]   The longer you work, the greater the earnings gap compared to non-Ivy League graduates.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.840]   And it seems to me that it just takes time for, I guess,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.280]   hard work,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.840]   intelligence, top grade scores, whatever it is, to start breaking away from the pack. You know, I think
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.560]   talent, hard work, kind of rises to the top. It's easier to rise to the top if you give it enough time.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.000]   But in the beginning, you know, if you land that job at XYZ company,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.400]   they're all gonna pay their graduates the same. And then over time, if you outperform,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.720]   then you will get paid commensurately. And
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:29.600]   maybe over three decades, if you really outperform, then you can become a C-level executive and make mega millions way beyond
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.760]   the average or median worker. But you know, lasting 20 years or 30 years in a profession is hard.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.440]   Personally, I could only last 13 years in banking before I was burned out.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.000]   Sure, I could probably have grinded for another five years to make it 18 years until my 40th birthday.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.800]   But you know, I was working 60 hours a week, lots of pressure, a lot of illnesses, sciatica, chronic back pain,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.880]   allergies,
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.240]   plantar fasciitis, TMJ, all these chronic illnesses that have now disappeared
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.080]   a while ago, about six months after I left my day job in 2012.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.800]   They were just crushing me. And so for the health and maybe for my life expectancy,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.920]   it was important that I leave to find something else to do. When we first start working, we all think, "Wow, I love this job."
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.360]   Well, maybe a lot of us think that. "I love this job.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.200]   I can do this for my entire career." And then 10 years of doing the same thing,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   hmm, you might change your mind. And then 20 years after doing the same thing, well,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.800]   I most certainly believe you would want to do something new.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   Now that we know what the median earnings is for Ivy League graduates three years, ten years, twenty years out of college are,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:49.040]   we got to understand, what do they do for work? Can you guess what industries they go into? I can guess, but I didn't realize
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.720]   these industries were so dominant. Because if you think about it, think about the high school
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.200]   applications and the essays you write about changing the world, helping humanity,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.280]   volunteering. It doesn't talk a lot about making a lot of money, right?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   It talks about making society better and being a good citizen and a good person while having top grades and
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:19.000]   standardized test scores, which looks like are going away more and more. So what does the data show? Well,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.320]   based on data for Harvard's class of 2022,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.920]   roughly 57% go into finance,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.400]   consulting, or technology. In other words, the majority of Harvard graduates chase money, status, and prestige,
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:39.520]   which is quite different from what they wrote in their college application essays. So this is
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   careerism. Careerism, as they talk about, where it's a guaranteed higher return on
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:52.440]   the investment they made going to college for four years and the price they pay for college. All right, well, to get specific,
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.060]   53% of respondents will begin consulting jobs. We're talking about the likes of McKinsey, Bain, BCG.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:06.080]   18% will go to finance jobs. We're talking about Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.000]   17% will go to technology jobs, such as Google,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.480]   Facebook, and Apple. Beyond the big three sectors, 9% will pursue academia or research. All right, right on. That's great.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.440]   6% engineering. 6% health.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.880]   4% arts and entertainment. All right.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.080]   4% public service. And 3% government or politics.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.640]   If you go over to the show notes and click over to my post, you'll see this great graph by where Harvard graduates go by
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:47.320]   sector. And all the way to the right, tiny little bar charts, you see law, interestingly, only at around
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.040]   1.6%.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.280]   Education at 0.4% and then sports 0.3%.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:01.400]   Going into professional sports is not a surprise, but how few Harvard graduates go into law is a surprise.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   Maybe that's because it's they go to law school and that's that's not included.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.160]   But whatever the case may be, it doesn't seem like big law is very popular. Whereas I would say 15-20 years ago,
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.440]   I thought going into big law was very popular. You get paid
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.400]   $15,000 after law school, but then you got to go to law school, right, for three years and that costs big bucks.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.120]   I do see a couple other categories quite interesting and that's
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.000]   entrepreneurship. About
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.440]   2.4% go into entrepreneurship. Good for them. I love that field. And then about
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.840]   2.1% go into publishing and media. I also love that field. But the data sure
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:47.480]   highlights how the security and high pay of consulting, finance, and technology are what
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.200]   the vast majority of Harvard graduates are interested in. Now, I don't know if they're interested exactly in doing those things,
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.560]   but they are interested in the money part of it because these fields pay the most. We're talking
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.480]   $120,000 to $200,000 right out of college all in.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.920]   Really comfortable living for a 23 year old. But I think this is where there's kind of
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.440]   dissatisfaction five, ten, fifteen years out if you keep on doing these jobs.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.560]   Because again, if you look at what the students were thinking about doing in high school and what they were
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:30.240]   studying in college, because these are liberal arts colleges, you study humanities, also sciences, engineering, you study everything.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.120]   But if the concentration is almost 60% into consulting, finance, and technology,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.760]   then there will be plenty of students who didn't foresee these
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:48.560]   sectors as careers, as what they plan to do for their one and only life. And so you'll see that. I saw that myself.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:55.440]   I mean, first personally, I studied economics because I liked economics and I wanted to do something with stocks,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.040]   equities, investment banking, because I traded stocks in college. I thought it was fascinating.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   But even after 13 years, I was like, this is no longer fascinating.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.080]   It's actually really hard work and there must be something else to life than just trying to make
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.720]   money from the stock market or trying to make hedge funds and institutional money managers money
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:20.320]   so they can perform well for their clients. I mean, it's fine, but it's not like, oh, life passion to make more money.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.960]   Nah, I don't think so at all. You got to make enough money to feel secure,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.840]   to cover your basic living expenses, to be able to take some vacations every now and then.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.200]   But helping people, doing something purposeful,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.480]   receiving positive feedback from people is what really will move you and make you feel alive.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.760]   The one thing that keeps me going like Popeye's spinach,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:50.960]   recording and writing on Financial Samurai is really nice reader and listener feedback.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.800]   I got this email from Arjun out of the blue. He said, Sam, been reading your Buy This, Not That book.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   It's phenomenal. Love your clear writing, data-driven approach. I've written pages of notes.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:08.480]   Just wanted to send a note to share my gratitude. Your work has made such a difference in my life. My deepest appreciation.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.600]   Thank you from a fan. You know, I felt amazing after reading that. I got at 746 a.m. on Monday, April 24th.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.880]   Thank you, Arjun. Thank you for taking the time to reach out. That means a lot.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:26.680]   And now I've got energy for the next week to record, to write, to respond to comments, to respond to emails.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:33.000]   This type of feedback feels great, way better than when I was working in finance where I would get positive feedback
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.680]   maybe once a year, but it was really more like what have you done for me lately?
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:43.120]   Come on, work harder, do this and that. So please, if you want to feel great about what you do,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.200]   find something you love to do. Find what the world needs.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:54.720]   Find what you're good at and find what you can be paid for. This inner section of these four things
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   is called the Ikigai. We talked about it before. Ikigai will help drive you towards a more fulfilling life.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:09.480]   You may be one of the fortunate few who after 20 years loves to continue to do consulting,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:17.240]   finance and technology. After 20 years, you will certainly be paid handsomely and keep on doing that.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.440]   That's awesome that you love to do what you love to do.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:27.720]   And if you have time on the side to do other things, hobbies, help the community, go for that as well.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:34.160]   And for those of you who are in these occupations you don't truly enjoy, that you don't feel, you know,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:41.880]   tugs at your heart every single day or every single week, well, figure out how much money is enough for you to then walk away.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:50.040]   Calculate that net worth target amount. Calculate that passive income investment amount. And once you get there, okay,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:57.400]   take a step back and see is that enough? Maybe work one more year because one more year will give you more time to plan
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.320]   to take that leap of faith.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:05.880]   But then do take that leap of faith because worst case if things don't turn out like you had imagined,
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.120]   you can always go back to work in two or three years. In conclusion,
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.760]   making 90,500 ten years out to
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:21.280]   161,000 20 years out is a very comfortable middle-class lifestyle.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.160]   Maybe upper middle class and it's probably gonna go higher given inflation.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:32.800]   But it's not enough to stress so hard about killing yourself in grade school to get the best scores possible,
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:41.520]   test scores and grades to get into one of these colleges, which has way too much demand to accept more than
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.240]   3 to 7 percent of its applicants. There are plenty of other great universities.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.960]   You would call them, I don't know, Ivy League adjacent.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.120]   There's probably top 50 schools that, top of 75 schools, 100 schools that'll enable you to get that career that you want.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.360]   So don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.000]   Don't think not getting to a top university is the end-all be-all.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.640]   I'm an example of one of them. My wife is an example one of them.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.160]   Yeah, William & Mary is a top 50 school. It's a public school,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.080]   but it gave us as much opportunity as we could have hoped for, we could have imagined.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:24.240]   Once you get your foot in the door, it's what you do that matters. It's your network. It's your relationships.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:31.080]   It's your outperformance. It's your work ethic. I'm hearing my kids singing right now in the hallway.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.480]   So I think it's time to go and take them to school.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.240]   Thanks so much everyone for listening. If you like this podcast, I'd appreciate a positive review.
