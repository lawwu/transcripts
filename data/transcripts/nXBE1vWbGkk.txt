[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Shout out to a company, Sax and I were doing.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.240]   What the hell are you doing?
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.560]   What are you doing?
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.680]   What the fuck are you doing?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.400]   No, I cannot do that.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.560]   Nick, Nick, cut that shit out.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.020]   Nick, cut that shit out.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.360]   Shut the fuck up.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.460]   Beat that shit out.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460]   I just wanted to give a founder a plug.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.740]   You are such a scumbag.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.180]   What the fuck?
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.400]   Despite how tired I am, I've woken up now.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.080]   Now I'm awake.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.040]   You've awakened the drug.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'm done.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.560]   I quit.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.200]   I'll give a shout out to which just got acquired by.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.480]   Oh my God.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.420]   We need plugs.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.300]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.840]   Rain man, David.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.020]   And it said, we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.560]   Love you guys.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.760]   Nice.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.680]   Queen of.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.260]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.000]   Welcome to the all in podcast.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.800]   I'm Jason Calacanis with us today.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.080]   The rain man himself calling in from an undisclosed location.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.980]   The queen of.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.460]   And of course the dictator himself.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.400]   Chamath Pali.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.300]   Hopped to you.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.120]   All right, boys.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.000]   How are we doing?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.380]   Feel flow energy today.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.980]   What's going on?
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.540]   Great.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.420]   How are you?
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.980]   What's going on?
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.560]   Let's go.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.480]   Let's do this.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.100]   I love it.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.740]   Let's go.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.040]   Love it.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.440]   All right.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.840]   You're hot.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.600]   You're coming in hot.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.660]   Well, yeah.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.660]   Breaking news.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.860]   Breaking news.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.420]   Uh, Biden has announced, uh, his capital gains tax hike.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.220]   I don't think this impacts any of us.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.380]   But Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:43.600]   individuals from 20% to not 25, not 28, 39.6% to help pay for the social spending.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.820]   And in equality for those earning 1 million or more.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.060]   So nobody on this call federal tax rates could be as high as 43.4%.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.740]   The capital gains increase would raise 370 billion over a decade.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.300]   Yada, yada.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.020]   For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.100]   in Californians.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.700]   56.7%.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.620]   Biden has previously warned that those earning over 400,000 can expect to pay more in taxes.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.060]   This was just breaking news a couple of hours before we started the pod and the stock market is,
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.340]   uh, down and people are freaking out.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.340]   We should do a.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.940]   J Cal, I want to hear your take on this.
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.280]   Actually.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.520]   Why didn't you tell me Biden was going to do this?
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.640]   I would have voted for Trump.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.040]   You didn't tell me this is going to hit me so hard.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.120]   No, J Cal was ranting on this topic 15 minutes ago.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.760]   We were talking and I'm like, dummy, what did you think was going to happen?
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.160]   You know, he's sitting there going off.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.200]   He's sitting there going off.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.480]   It's like, what did you expect?
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.840]   Just before we get into it, we should do a quick primer on what this means, right?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.160]   So capital gains taxes are the taxes you pay when you make an investment and you sell that investment
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.800]   at a profit.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.160]   The, the, you pay a tax on the profit you make, and there's a difference between capital gains on
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.560]   the short term, which means less than one year and long-term, which means you've had the investment
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.840]   for more than a year.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.360]   So economic policy historically has dictated that having a low capital gains tax rate relative to
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.440]   what, you know, an income tax rate might make.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.280]   It might be incentivizes people to make long-term investments and it gets more money moving in the
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.680]   economy.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.560]   And as a result, um, you know, the economy will grow.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.480]   And so the idea of.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.520]   Increasing the long-term capital gains tax from 20%, which it currently is to 40%,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.680]   um, is a real striking, you know, economic policy shift rationalized as, you know, we're going to
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.880]   save, uh, you know, we're going to use this money for social spending.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.280]   But I think the historical context and what this is, is really important as we get into
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.000]   the conversation.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.560]   Um, and just speaking historically, you know, the, the, the maximum tax rate on long-term
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.880]   capital gains got up to 40% sacks.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.480]   You probably have the history on this in 19.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.400]   78 for a year, right.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920]   Or like 76 to 78.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.800]   And then it's been largely, you know, 15 to 20% for the last 20 years or so.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.280]   Um, and so to jump up, yeah.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.040]   And prior to that, in the early part of the 20th century, it was like 25% pretty consistently
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.080]   for a long time.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.640]   So to jump up to 40%, it's a really big shift.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.960]   And there's a lot of debate around the economic implications of doing this.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.160]   Uh, I thought that was important.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.920]   Let's take a step back and actually see the forest from the trees and the forest from
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.720]   the trees is that.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.160]   I don't think.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.440]   Biden, um, thinks that it's a credible plan.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   Um, in as much as I probably think, uh, he needs, you know, this is like it's performative,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.840]   um, because it was a lot larger.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.440]   The number, the headline number was a lot larger than, um, what people were whispering
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.480]   was going to be the number, right.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.040]   It was supposed to be like in the low thirties or maybe kind of like, you know, 33, 34.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.920]   Um, and then all of a sudden, like to come out of.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:04.600]   39.6, I think it's almost like, okay, he's, he's giving the pound of flesh to, uh, the,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   the left.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.440]   Kind of like woke mob of the democratic party who probably doesn't understand how capitalism
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.960]   works in the first place and doesn't care because they're not, they're not participants
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.200]   in it.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.640]   Now, the, the, my reaction is, I don't think it's going to pass.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.480]   I think it's going to be really tough to get done.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.080]   And I think it probably, you know, maybe, maybe there's a watered down version, but
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.600]   this version, I, I, I'm not sure.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.880]   I'm not super worried about, and then it just comes back to the same thing over and over
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.360]   the, the fewer, the number of people that get to participate in the growth and see the
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.760]   upside, the more there are that just wants to just kind of, you know, tear it all down.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.160]   And so, I don't know, it's just yet another signal that we have these structural issues
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.560]   to fix.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.240]   It's not reasonable that a few people get super rich and everybody else gets left on
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.800]   the sidelines.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.920]   Sacks.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.480]   Where are your thoughts?
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.160]   It's not going to pass, but it's not going to pass.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.640]   It's not going to pass.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.520]   Is it going to pass?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.880]   Is it an opening salvo?
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.120]   Where he wants to get to 32.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.480]   So he's starting at 39.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.920]   I think it could pass because I think they're, they're planning to do this tax increase as
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.720]   part of the second infrastructure bill.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.920]   It's not really an infrastructure bill.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.440]   They're calling it human infrastructure.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.120]   We've talked about this infrastructure is one of the last categories of federal spending.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.320]   That's still popular.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.840]   So they're rebranding a bunch of social programs as human infrastructure.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.080]   I think that bill will pass.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.120]   I don't know if the rate will stay at 39.6, but I think there will be a big increase.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.000]   Clearly in the cap gains rate.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.720]   I mean, I think it's worth remembering how it got to 20%.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.360]   It got to 20% because Bill Clinton lowered it from 28 to 20 as part of an overall package
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   of tax reforms that he did in the, in the sort of the mid nineties.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.280]   And, you know, that led to some of the best years of economic performance, GDP growth
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.880]   in the U S productivity growth deficit reduction.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:03.080]   You know, and so, you know, I think we're, we're, we are experimenting with breaking
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.400]   something that's been working, I think pretty well since the, the Reagan Clinton years which
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.360]   is to have, you know, reasonably low taxes on capital formation and investment.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.120]   I think it's a category error to treat capital gains or to think about it just as income.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   You have to remember that all of this money has already been taxed once, right?
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.640]   So you make the money the first time.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   As income you earn it, you pay tax on it.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.480]   Then you decide to save some of it and invest it.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.560]   And then you get taxed again on that amount.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.480]   And so, so capital gains is a form of double taxation.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.400]   That was the original reason.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.880]   One of the reasons to have a different tax rate for it.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:49.800]   And you know, I think that this risk kind of messing up the economic recovery that's
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.840]   really underway already.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.400]   By the way, think about what just happens to any organization.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.280]   I mean, you know, you have a lot of people in the organization that has to pay cap gains,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.680]   right?
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.720]   It's not just individuals.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.760]   Like last time I checked organizations aren't exempt from cap gains for profit organizations.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.680]   And I don't exactly know what they will do as well.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.320]   So, you know, you, you, you're putting a lot of people under a huge strain when you double
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.720]   the, the, the effective rate of return.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.960]   So, you know, if you're, for example, like a pension fund, right?
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.160]   And you have an enormous investment in,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.920]   in a private equity fund or a hedge fund.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.400]   Part of these things is that, you know, there are these complete pass through vehicles.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.640]   And so as long as like you've structured yourself in a way where you don't have to
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.880]   pay that tax, I think, I guess you're indifferent, but if you're any organization or institution
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.960]   or a person or a collection of people that bears that tax, all of a sudden, you know,
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.120]   your returns have been basically cut in half.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.280]   That's pretty nuts.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.960]   Let's talk about the average Joe for a second or Jane, as it were.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.320]   401ks would take a hit here.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.960]   And then when you go to your retirement and you have to liquidate them.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.480]   You know, you don't pay tax on the, on the gains.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.840]   You don't pay tax on that.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.320]   You don't pay tax on the 401k gains during your.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.080]   Otherwise your portfolio, because 401k is going to be a small amount.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.200]   You can contribute to it in a year.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.320]   So retirees who happen to have stock market gains or cryptocurrency, people trading that.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.360]   You'll basically pay the same as income tax as opposed to paying a lower tax.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.480]   So would a.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.000]   It'll diminish investment, Jason.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.680]   It's exactly what David says, which is that.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.920]   On the, on a marginal basis, what will happen is inflation probably goes up because people
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.960]   just decide to consume rather than invest because they think, well, what's the point?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.120]   You know, there's already risk that I bear.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.000]   And so, you know, the, the earliest risk assets, right?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.360]   The riskiest ones that we all participate in, which is early stage venture and company
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:42.840]   formation.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.560]   There's you, you may not be thinking about the capital gains rate, but it's implicit
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.160]   in the returns that you're expecting for the risk and the time you're going to take.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.440]   And, you know, we've been trained to feel that rate.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.960]   And if you double that rate from 20 to 40, I suspect that there's a lot of people whose
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.480]   risk tolerance changes and they're going to feel their after-tax gains differently.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   And they'll wonder to themselves, is this worth it?
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.280]   And then I think what happens as a result is entrepreneurship drags.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.640]   I don't know if anybody's done an analysis, but I suspect part of the reason why America
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.240]   is such a, you know, an amazing like sink for capital, right?
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.200]   It absorbs capital all around the world is that.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.160]   You've created incentives that get people very excited because they think they can get rewarded.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.480]   If you take those rewards away, I think the implications are much bigger than just the
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   cap gains rates here, because as the people change their behavior, then the capital formation
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.960]   pools outside of the United States changed their behavior.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.360]   And the whole thing has a knock-on effect and it was more muted in Clinton.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   It was less muted in 78.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.000]   It basically didn't exist in the forties and fifties, but it is a huge force today.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.960]   I mean, like we are an indebted nation that owes money.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.600]   We owe money to all kinds of countries around the world, including China.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.920]   We're supposed to generate growth and sort of pay it back.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.080]   And where will the growth come from?
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.600]   If LPs don't want to back venture funds or venture funds, but let's be honest and check out.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.120]   Let's be honest and direct.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   I mean, are any of you guys going to change your investment behavior?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.960]   If the cap gains tax goes to 40%.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.720]   No, but there'll be less of it, you know?
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.960]   So look, anything, anything.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.840]   My behavior has changed.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.520]   I think my behavior will change.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.720]   How will it change?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.440]   I think it will change.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.480]   It's exactly what David said.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   So I just put in a hundred million dollars into a climate change company two weeks ago.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.240]   Under this promise, I could only put in 50.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.160]   So there's 50 million less progress that's going to happen on that business.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.320]   I'm not sure that that was, that's the right answer for what that company is trying to do
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.720]   in the world.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.960]   And the way you're saying that you're saying the profits you would have had from before
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.160]   are diminished in half.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.200]   Therefore you would only have half as much money to invest as an investor.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.320]   Right.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.480]   So, so however way you want to cut it, whether it's.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.600]   Like the 10 companies gets cut down into five or the five, 10 companies that I invest in,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.800]   get half my money.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.160]   The point is at some point.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160]   The money starts to run out, not just for me, but for everybody else.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   Basically at the end of the day, the money goes into the hands of, you know, government
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.080]   legislators and administrators to decide how that money gets spent.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.280]   And it's not in the hands of, uh, capitalist investors to decide where to invest.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.480]   That's the fundamental kind of.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.640]   Shift that that's going to happen.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:21.880]   Right.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.240]   Capital capital has been.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.520]   Taken out of the economy.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.960]   Risk capital has been taken out of the economy and it's now going to be, you know, spent
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.000]   by, by government.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Look, any, anything that you tax you punish and disincentivize and anything you subsidize,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.800]   you, you create an incentive for there to be more of.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.440]   And, you know, so this is just, we, we always talk about these things in terms of, well,
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.480]   who they're going to hurt.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.760]   Is it the, the, or the, this only falls on the backs of rich people.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.400]   Um, so we shouldn't care, but the real question is what is this going to do to the economy?
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.000]   And, you know, I think we've talked in previous podcasts.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.280]   The, the last part that we have with Brad Gerstner, it feels like everything.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.800]   In the American system is kind of broken except for one thing, which is
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.400]   this sort of opportunity economy.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.440]   That's that's been created by risk capital, right.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.080]   And, and people creating new companies, you know, like these big stultifying political
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.960]   corporations, the S and P 500 are completely broken.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.640]   Government's completely broken.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.800]   The federal debt is out of control.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   Everything's the media is broken.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.760]   Everything in America is either broken or needs to be revitalized.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.360]   Or reformed, except one thing is working really well, which is risk capital and its allocation
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.560]   to founders who have nothing but a good idea.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.360]   Right.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.800]   And when all of a sudden you double the cap gains rate, that is an attack on that opportunity
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.120]   society.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.320]   Now, I think there is a legitimate conversation to be had about how do we spread this sort
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.120]   of system of opportunity to more and more people.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.800]   I think like Brad framed it really well in the last episode, like, how do we get more
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.760]   people involved in that?
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.680]   I would submit the answer has a lot to do with.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.400]   School choice and charter schools giving people, everyone in this country deserves
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.760]   to have a first rate education.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.720]   And so that is a very legitimate conversation to have, but I think to have punitive taxation
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.480]   on it is I think it's at risk breaking that last thing that is working so well in, in,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.440]   in the American system.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.640]   I, I think it's really well said.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.960]   And I think this is gonna take redomiciling to another level.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.520]   I mean, if you were in New York or California right now, and you were thinking about Wyoming
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.600]   or Utah or Texas.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.560]   Or Florida.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.560]   I mean, this kind of makes the decision for you if it does go to 40 and because that's
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.400]   actually me, would you get to neutral if you left?
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.800]   And so I, well, I remember, I remember when I moved to the United States in 2000,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:44.360]   the marginal tax bracket that I was in and I was making maybe, you know, a hundred, no,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.480]   I was probably making 80 or $90,000 a year was 55%.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   And I remember coming to the United States.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.440]   And seeing my after my take home pay my first paycheck.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.920]   And I was shocked because I was like, you know, I was paying maybe 36% all blended in
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.280]   federal and local at the time or state at the time in California.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.720]   And slowly, slowly, it's creeping up with, with, if you play it out today, where we are
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.400]   plus New York state just passed laws.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:17.160]   You're gonna be sort of in the 50 to 55%, almost upwards of 56% for certain folks.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.800]   And maybe the answer is that's the right thing.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.440]   But I think we have to acknowledge that that's.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.600]   There's going to be a bunch of unintended consequences.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:31.560]   So maybe the intended consequence is to actually create more equality between the richest few
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.760]   and, you know, not even the poorest, frankly, because but it'll just be the richest few
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.600]   and the next richest few, quite honestly, because like, you know, the investing class
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.720]   is still a small number of people.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.360]   But the unintended consequences of that decision, I think, is what exactly what
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.800]   David said, which is that over the next five or 10 year period, you will, at a practical level,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.280]   see less investment.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.160]   And the the only way to make that whole is if the government then takes all that money,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.000]   and all of a sudden allocates it from their own coffers back into the economy.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.520]   And we know that that's not going to happen.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.120]   Well, right, that's just going to be riddled with waste and graft and corruption.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.160]   So unfortunately, the setup is that, you know, you're going to really impact entrepreneurship.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.440]   And then and then I wonder to myself, by the way, guys, like,
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.280]   what was the actual goal of this, meaning there was 20 or 30 guys that were
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.080]   just making so much money on their equity. But then that's then then we need to blame like the
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.640]   these lists like the Forbes billionaires list, because those are inaccurate, because a lot of
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:39.080]   these stuff is like, unrealized, realized paper gains. Right. And so they're not they're not
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.520]   paying any capital gains, because they haven't sold anything. And most of these guys that are
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.240]   uber uber rich, you know, have no desire to sell because it's for them. It's a control issue to
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.800]   sell.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.200]   I'm not sure the car I'm not sure that the consequence of taxing uber rich people
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.680]   is the true motivation. I think for some people, maybe it is. But if we just take a step back,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.560]   I mean, a year ago, the US debt level was significantly lower than it is today,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:09.800]   we've taken on a tremendous amount of federal debt to fund a series of programs that we believe
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.600]   we're going to kind of keep, you know, the American population employed and keep our economy
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:22.120]   moving. That was a massive burden we accrued and in the past year, so ultimately, over time, the only way
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:28.600]   to kind of support this, this new federal budget, and you know, the this new servicing costs that
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.760]   we've taken on at the government level, you really only have kind of like three options.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.040]   Option one is you're going to continue to raise more debt and massively kind of inflate everything
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.640]   and the dollar declines in value. Option two is to reduce spending, which means starting to cut
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.760]   these programs. And option three is to raise taxes. And it's pretty clear that option one is
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.000]   one where we're kind of already at the economic limit.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.680]   And option two is going to be very hard to swallow at a time like this. So you can't just cut spending
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.560]   right now. Across the board, so many aspects of the US economy and so many individuals in the
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.000]   United States are dependent on the federal government for support. And so option three
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.480]   is the only real one that's left on the table. And so then the question is, who are you taxing,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.680]   you're not going to go tax the people that are struggling, you're going to tax
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.600]   the corporations and the wealthy. And then the capital gains tax is the one
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.960]   place where you can kind of say, look, the tax rate that you're paying today is
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.840]   half of what an income tax rate would be if you were earning that as income.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.560]   Let's get it to be fair and even. And I think just just to argue this other side,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.600]   like there's a motivation, there's a there's a point of view where this is coming from. It's
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.480]   not just let's go tax the rich, screw the economy. It's that we find ourselves in a circumstance
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.920]   where we need to do one of those three things. The most rational to do is to
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:47.640]   or the most kind of sensible politically to do is to increase taxation. And this is the
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.880]   first place to go the most obvious place to go. It's not because
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.880]   so when you think about like, so for example, like, you know, you would say, okay,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.120]   who are the folks that we're talking about, there can be entrepreneurs that are building companies,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.040]   again, they're never selling, so they're never going to pay these taxes. Like it's not the case
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.400]   that Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg is all of a sudden going to write a $40 billion check because
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.480]   that's, that's not how much they make. That may be how much they're worth,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.120]   but they will never sell a single share unless they have to fund some other project, in which
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.800]   case, three things would you do? So, so what I was
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   going to say is, so, and then and then you look at somebody else, like, maybe you say, Oh, well,
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.240]   you know, the people that manage money, like, let's go after those guys, because like, those
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.480]   guys shouldn't be, you know, rich. But then the problem is, those guys are already paying
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.920]   w two income, they're already paying nominal income tax rates. That's how
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.960]   the entire hedge fund industry works right now. You know, you get paid in current income.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.280]   And so, okay, so you're not getting their money, because they're already paying at the
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.720]   prevailing rate. So again, this goes back to if you actually trace the problem and see who it affects,
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.120]   it's exactly what David said, it's these folks that are in the middle, that are actually putting
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   the money to work, that are trying to invest in things that now have a very different return
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.560]   profile. And you're right, the core business that they do, they may still keep doing, but then all
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.360]   of the incremental things in the future that they want to do, they won't do for example, look at all
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.560]   of the talk right now about how everybody needs to stand up, you know, more angel investing, more
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:21.640]   minority investing, more women, GPS, all of this stuff. Well, all of the folks, let's just be honest,
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:28.600]   all the folks that are in a position to put money into those folks are now 50% on a dollar rated
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.840]   basis poorer if this thing passes. And I bet you what they're going to do is they're not going to
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.240]   cut their allocations in Sequoia. They're going to cut their allocations to all these other folks.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.000]   Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, Chamath is, I was it going to hurt it's again,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.600]   it's going to hurt all the people that you want to get into the game. It's going to hurt all the
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:51.000]   people that are here. But the richest richest rich folks that is not unless you expropriate the money
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.560]   from them.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.000]   You're not you're not going to get a single cent.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.880]   And then that was the that was the concept of the wealth tax wasn't it that you would take the total
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.640]   value what you have and just take away 1% a year from Bezos is you know, or Zuckerberg's $100
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.920]   billion. So would that not have been a better solution than this if you had to pick one a 1%
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.480]   wealth? That's just that's a people over whatever,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.960]   Jason, then then we're no better than a banana republic that could also expropriate a mine,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.760]   because we don't like the way that the mining is happening or you know,
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.480]   another critical asset because the government does
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.080]   decide that it's important. I mean, what's the difference between a stock and any other asset
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:32.200]   that either a person or a corporation owns? It's, it's it's very, I think that the definitions are
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.040]   thin. They're all the same things at the end of the day.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.320]   Let's go back. Let's go back to the federal budget problem. Like how do you address it,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.920]   Sax? I mean, what's the right course here?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:45.080]   What I think is amazing is we're we're about to spend we're raising this hundreds of billions
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:51.160]   of taxes in order to fund you know, trillions of new spending. I don't really hear the administration's
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.960]   voice. I don't really hear the government's voice. I don't really hear the government's voice.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.920]   I don't really hear the government's voice. I don't really hear the government's voice.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.880]   All we're really talking about is that there's too many rich people,
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.840]   you know, we have these millionaires and billionaires, we got to tax them more.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.520]   And so all we're really talking about is whether it's appropriate to be punishing
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.080]   the rich and super rich. We're not really talking about where's this money going?
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   Are these programs just fine? What do we get out of it? Exactly. And my point is,
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.800]   forget about like who it's gonna hurt. I think it's eventually gonna hurt the economy.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.320]   And the question is, what do we get out of it? And I think what's amazing is,
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.520]   this isn't even paying for the big ticket items on the progressive wish list. We're not getting to
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.040]   universal healthcare with this. We're not getting to universal higher education.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.320]   We're not getting to any of the, we're not getting to like forgiveness of student loans
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.800]   or anything like that. We're not getting to any of the really big ticket items on the progressive
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.440]   wish list. And yet we're maxing out the taxes relative to anything we've done historically.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:51.240]   And so where do you go from here? You know, because this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.480]   of the progressive agenda. Doesn't that speak to the problem? Like the fact that we have such
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:02.200]   an extraordinarily high debt burden and federal budget that we're kind of scrambling to figure
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.360]   out a way to kind of make ends meet effectively, right? I mean, because our alternative again,
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:12.680]   is to just let massive inflation run, you know, issue a ton of new debt or to cut spending.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.640]   No, no, no. But David, either of those seem to be on the table.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.160]   No, no, no. You're going to exacerbate this issue. I'm telling you, I know it doesn't seem likely,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.680]   but I think on a marginal basis, this will be an incentive to spend. And the reason is that
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   it's a very frustrating idea for somebody to think about putting money in the ground,
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.640]   especially a sophisticated investor at a rate of return that just changed in half.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.320]   And so from my perspective, I would be more likely to spend because I would rather just YOLO the
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.360]   money than I would rather put it into the ground because I would be worried that that could then
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.520]   get taken away from me. It could also change even further and further. And I think that's a very
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.840]   frustrating idea. I'd rather take a vacation. Again, let's go back to the example. I'd rather
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.800]   take a vacation with that $10,000 than go on to Jason Syndicate and put it into the hands of folks
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.840]   because I'm just like, you know what, it's going to turn into even if Jason hits it and I get back,
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.720]   you know, I'd rather just go on vacation. Enough of those decisions. And I think you have a very
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.280]   different kind of economy. You have, you know what you have? You have what everybody else has.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.960]   So do we reduce spending?
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.000]   I think you have to reduce expenses. I think that we have an infrastructure that is not
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.120]   well accounted for. Meaning if you're a company, you can go to a company like Tableau, you can go
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.400]   to a company like, you know, pick your pick your metrics company. And within, you know, a few weeks
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   and months of work, you can literally understand where all the dollars are, right? You can
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.480]   understand your business and you can figure out where money is being wasted and where it's not.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:45.560]   In a government that's impossible to do, right? Because you have these laws and these laws are
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.920]   artificial constructs that we construct. And those artificial constructs are influenced by
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.320]   money in and of itself. And so these dollar flows are impossible to map. So you don't know where it
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.920]   goes. So for example, the $700 billion budget in the Pentagon, does anybody have any idea what the
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.600]   ROI is on that? Or even a way to measure it, like even to actually make it simple? What like if you
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.920]   were if you had $700 billion of investment capital, the market has a really simple way of saying,
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.160]   Okay, David, what's your ROIC? What's your return on invested capital, and
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.840]   you can say all kinds of fancy things, you can have all kinds of fancy
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.800]   projects or simple projects. But at the end of the day, what is measurable is a dollar in and
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.760]   what that dollar grew into. And that's a return on invested capital, it is impossible to know that.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.360]   And so you know, we could say, for example, you could define it and say, Well,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.840]   I'm going to basically get every single person to graduate high school. And now I'm going to
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.640]   spend $500 billion a year to make sure that the graduation rate is 100%. That would be
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.760]   an incredible goal. You know what, that is absolutely measurable, right? And and you'd
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.560]   be able to back into all of these programs and the one that's ones that didn't work, you'd cut,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.320]   you know, and you'd end up with what David said, which is school vouchers. I mean, just
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:05.000]   I think I think the absence of that accountability, Chamath has led us to a scary dilemma. And the
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.960]   dilemma is over 10 million Americans are directly employed by federal government.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.720]   And a large swath of the remainder of the economy is supported by federal government spending,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.680]   which is basically your point, right? So large, large amounts of defense and military construction,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.240]   health care and pharma, I mean, the list goes on, but like the direct employees of the federal
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.120]   government, plus the amount of revenue that depends on federal spending is so significant now,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.920]   as a percent of the total income generated by Americans, that it is very hard to say, like,
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.560]   let's create accountability in a system when so much of the economy is functionally dependent on
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.720]   it. Am I missing something? Sachs? Like, I mean, isn't that the circumstance we're in right now?
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.600]   Yeah, I mean, the thing that like, is amazing to me is, you know, I lived through the 1980s and
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   1990s, like, like, you know, it's like, you know, you're a business owner, you're a business owner,
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   you guys did from 1982 to 2000. That 18 year period, we had sort of an unrivaled economic
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.680]   performance, it was roughly around, we had two bad years under George Herbert Walker Bush, that's why
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.960]   he lost reelection. But we had close to 40% growth in GDP. Every year, we had great productivity.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:17.800]   And we had massive deficit reduction. It's the last 4% a year. Yeah, and we and we had we actually
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.520]   had government's surpluses, budget surpluses.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:36.680]   Yeah, we had a lot of
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.000]   that.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.640]   Yeah, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we had a lot of
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   that. And, you know, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we had a lot of
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:50.440]   that. And, you know, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we had a lot of that.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:50.920]   And, you know, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we had a lot
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.960]   that. And, you know, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we had a lot of that. And, you know, we
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.680]   know that works, you know, we know that works. I and you know, somehow we've moved away from what
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:03.160]   we learned in that time period, because, you know, I think the the left in this country has has become
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.560]   kind of, you know, has embraced this,
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.240]   we're saying the same thing, you set up the incentives for people to invest, they do,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.400]   if you set up the incentives for people to spend, they will do that as well.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.200]   And I see this, I think Chamath is exactly right,
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.360]   there are a lot of people and you use the example of the syndicate.com. When I do my syndicate,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.520]   deals, there are people who are recreationally saying, you know what, I love the idea of putting
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.480]   five or 10k into a flyer, they're gonna, you know, half of them will go away a third of them,
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.880]   all these people who are, you know, involved in day trading, or crypto or real estate investing,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.200]   they're gonna look at and say, Is this worth the time? Or is it worth this amount of time,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.160]   maybe I'll cut back from doing 40 hours a week of this to 20.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.440]   And if you look at what happened, crypto people, they went to Puerto Rico,
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.280]   you look what happened to venture capitalists and CEOs, they went to Florida, Miami, Austin,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.760]   New York, this is gonna, if it does pass, you could be pushing people to Singapore.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.760]   Well, we have another very complicated problem. And this is what freebird brought up, which is,
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.840]   and I don't know the answer, David. So I'm trying to I'm actually talking around your question,
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.560]   because I think it's a it's, it's the right absolute question. But think about this,
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.040]   what happens in a world where now let's just say that the revenue of the government goes up,
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.240]   right? But outcomes stay the same or get worse.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.960]   And at the same time, and you could claim that that's effectively what's been happening over the
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.200]   last 20 years.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.000]   20 or 30 years, right? Government revenues have gone up, impact to stay the same or probably been
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.200]   net negative. But then at the same time, you have this, you know, program of quantitative easing,
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.840]   where then you can essentially print money on demand. And when you think about that,
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.560]   it's like, wait a minute, I am giving you money. But then then you are also going to
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:45.320]   the photocopier machine with my money to make more money. And all of that total money does less
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.120]   than what it did when it was half that or a quarter or a third of it. That's a very scary real
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.160]   ization, I think that people, you know, will eventually come to. And I don't know what the
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.720]   answer to that is. I, you know, I think David Saxey, who said it was just like, you know,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   the states are this incredible a B test, right? Because you get to test like theories,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.480]   right? And you have you have now every complexion of theory, you have like,
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.640]   you know, the low tax dates, the no tax dates, the mid tax dates, you have high real estate taxes,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.800]   low real estate taxes, high estate tax, whatever, you get every grab bag of incentives.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.040]   And you're going to see but the problem is that was assuming that the federal government kind of mostly
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.280]   stayed out of the way. Right? You have this massive overlay.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.840]   Yeah, I just posted a chart in the chat that Nick can put up, which is federal spending,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.280]   federal outlays of percentage of GDP. And it's really interesting, because federal outlays of
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:40.520]   percent of GDP have generally been around the 20% line plus or minus a couple of percent
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:49.240]   since you know, the 1980s. And last year, in 2019, it was 20.7%. It jumped to 31.7%.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:55.720]   It was 2.3% under COVID. And it now feels like we're trying to make this new level of, you know,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.880]   going from 20 to 30 permanent. It's like mask mask wearing.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.360]   Well, the the problem. The problem is the only time we did that in history was in World War Two.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.560]   Now we were trying to fight the Nazis, which was worth spending the money on.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.240]   Yeah, I would say that was a good use of capital.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.960]   But it's very step back, right? I mean, what starts out as temporary becomes permanent?
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.240]   Is that kind of the concern?
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.560]   Well, that's what that's what Milton Friedman said is there's nothing
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.880]   quite so permanent as a temporary government program. Right?
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.280]   Right. But but what they're
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.640]   threatening to make permanent is this new permanently higher level of federal spending
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.720]   in the economy. And I think it's a very dangerous experiment because it either takes tremendous
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.280]   money printing to support it, or a tremendous tax burden. And neither one of them is good for
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.120]   the economy. By the way, you know, again, when Bill Clinton left office, I remember, you know,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:47.080]   you can go to the time machine for whitehouse.gov when he left in 2000. And he bragged about how
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.960]   his eight years as president, they reduce federal spending from 22% of the economy to 18% of the
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.800]   economy. Can you imagine a Democrat today boasting of that?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:05.000]   Or even a Republican? I mean, what? Who was the guy who was your guy who was like,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.080]   the Tea Party people who there was somebody who was like in charge of the Senate?
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:09.960]   Rand Paul?
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.120]   I don't know who it was. But it was just like, we got to cut spending.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.960]   Oh, yeah. Ryan, the Speaker, the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Yeah.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.720]   Paul Ryan was like,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.440]   based on this.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.680]   Yes. But spending restraints kind of gone out the window and in both parties,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.320]   and the Republic, it did, it did happen under Trump, the Republicans don't seem to find their
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.640]   principles on spending unless and until there's a Democrat in the White House. So they definitely
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.840]   deserve their share of the blame on this. But But we do seem to be entering a new territory here
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.000]   of you know, this, again, levels of spending we've never seen before.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.880]   It's incredible. It's absolutely the problem. The problem is,
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.640]   it would be so much better if we just said we're going to do this one very specific thing.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:55.240]   With a huge number attached to it, like I would rather say, we're going to Mars, here's
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.480]   a trillion dollars, we're cutting student debt, here's a trillion dollars, we're going to double
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.960]   down on cyber, and we're going to get, you know, completely pivot the military or something. And
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:11.320]   here's 500 billion, whatever, something aspirational, that is not just anti rich
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.360]   people. Let's tax.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.880]   Right now we have we have labels, we have a label. And then we have a spaghetti mess of spending
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.560]   that just isn't really attached to what we're doing. And that's why we're doing this. And then we're
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.360]   what the label means and none of it is accountable. And so you don't really get anything for it.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.080]   I know this is a silly question, but why wouldn't we test this and say,
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:36.120]   "Hey, 20, 40, there are numbers between these two, maybe we'll increase it two percent a year
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.440]   for eight years, and we'll see what happens." I'm sorry, but Jason, this is the other
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.200]   problem with like this idea of American exceptionalism, we believe that we can't
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.240]   learn anything from anybody else and that's also not true. We actually know what it looks like when
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.520]   you have government as a massive portion of the economy. We also know examples where government
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:01.480]   basically enables human capital outcomes but remains relatively small and fixed. Singapore,
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:10.440]   there's this incredible example where I think right when Lee Kuan Yew became the head of
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:17.320]   Singapore, the GDP of Singapore was the same as the GDP of Jamaica. What you saw was this complete
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.400]   divergence in these two countries. And think about this country, which is basically this
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:33.240]   little spot of land surrounded and apolitical, areligious, surrounded by these Muslim countries,
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.800]   and they still thrived and they kicked ass. They were never invaded, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   And underneath that was this belief that it's what you said, Friedberg, where you focus on an outcome,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.960]   you spend against the outcome, and you try to measure in a reasonable way, and you double down
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.600]   on the things that work. Jason:
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.960]   And then on the other hand, if you look at Europe, Europe is a good example when
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   spending sometimes for the greater good in the best interest can run amok.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.680]   And really what happens is you start to stagnate.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.320]   Yeah. And Singapore is only what, six million people? I mean, it's like Ireland or
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.600]   Norway or Denmark. I mean, this is not a huge place.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.840]   It sounds like we didn't solve any problems in that last piece.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.520]   Yeah, we didn't solve it. I mean, what do we think is going to happen in four years? Does
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.800]   this give Donald Trump a clear path into office if he said, "Hey, we're on lower taxes again?"
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.720]   The worst case scenario is you see what happened in France when they had that 75%
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.240]   super tax, and then they introduced the wealth tax, and they had massive
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.880]   emigration of invested dollars out of the country and people out of the country.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.120]   They did get rid of George D.A. Pardue. That was a bonus. He went to Russia.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.480]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.080]   At what point... How many red pills do you guys have to take
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:44.600]   before you're willing to reassess your political party? Because it seems obvious to me... Now look,
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.360]   we could talk about how bad they're... What political party do you think...
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.680]   Hold on. Hold on. We could talk about how bad the Republican Party is, but there's no
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.480]   question in my mind that the Democratic Party, all the energy, the base, the activists,
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:01.000]   and the politicians who have the microphone, they are woke socialists, okay? That is the dominant
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.880]   ideology in the Democratic Party. And what Biden is doing right now is catering to that.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.520]   He's compromising with it.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.440]   Yeah, but he wasn't catering to that until this point. He didn't put Bernie
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:16.040]   or Elizabeth Warren into any cabinet positions. He kind of marginalized them. And now he's like,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.800]   "Okay, let's do something." I mean, would Warren and Bernie have done this?
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.320]   No, but Jason, I think you're right. This is why I think this is like a sacrificial lamb,
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.480]   and I don't think anything's going to happen. I think Biden is a fundamental centrist. That's
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.760]   why I like him. I think he's a...
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.240]   Boring.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:35.080]   He's a stable, predictable figure. And that's, I think, what you want in the presidency.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:40.360]   I think that this is sort of like, "Okay, you guys want a pound of flesh? Here you go." But
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.720]   I think he's so politically smart that he probably does have a bunch of millennial woke socialists.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.680]   He's probably the only one there who's smart enough to realize this won't get passed. It's not
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.480]   going to muster enough support.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.760]   I don't know. I think I...
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.080]   Biden is not governing like a centrist right now. He's proposing, what, four trillion of new
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.200]   spending, new tax increases, and he's just getting started. But look, and I would challenge this
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.000]   idea just slightly of him being a centrist. What I would say is he's always tacked to the center of
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:15.400]   the Democratic Party. So I do think he's a triangle between the two. I think he's a triangle between
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:22.680]   a triangulator and a calibrator. He's not like a conviction politician the way that Bernie Sanders
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.760]   is or an Elizabeth Warren. But what he's tacked to is the center of the Democratic Party. And the
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.480]   center of the Democratic Party has moved very far left because all the activists have moved to the
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.080]   left. And so he's been dragged left.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   Remember, Biden was Clinton's floor manager in the Senate when he passed all this legislation.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   And so now Biden is very far to the left of where Biden was in the 1990s. And the reason
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.320]   for that is because the Democratic Party has moved. So once again, I guess my question to all
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.040]   of you guys is, what does it take? How far does the Democratic Party have to go to the left?
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.600]   Not Donald Trump.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.240]   Okay.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.800]   Not Donald Trump.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.400]   I wouldn't call this-
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.280]   That's the problem is Donald Trump.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.520]   I wouldn't call this as much of a radical policy shift as I think it's being framed. I honestly
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.840]   think this is a natural and inevitable consequence of the circumstances we find
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.920]   ourselves in right now with respect to the spending level, the dependence we have on
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.760]   federal spending across the board with respect to individual employment and the
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.640]   the economy, the need for a variety of social services to get us through this COVID economic
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:25.720]   collapse. I just don't see another way out. And I feel like it's the natural course to do exactly
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.080]   what's going on right now. I think it's going to pass. I think something like it's going to pass.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.200]   I think something like it's going to pass, but I don't think it's going to pass.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.240]   Where do you put it at? You think it's going to be equidistant?
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.680]   I'm not saying it's good or bad. I think obviously we just find ourselves in this circumstance in
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.440]   this country in this moment in time, that this is the only path. I'm just not sure you can go in and
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:51.720]   go slash a ton of spending right now. And anyone would win reelection or most Americans would be
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.880]   anything but unhappy. It's just the consequence of where we are.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.800]   Let's play the glass half full. Here's a crazy idea. For example, somebody like me,
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:07.320]   what I would think about, which I think is a little crazy, but I would do it is, okay, I'm
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:14.120]   just going to move literally every single thing, every dollar that isn't nailed down into a charitable
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:20.440]   vehicle. And I will invest through my charity, because I still have to donate 5% a year. But
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.240]   then I can compound tax free. Now, I care more about the businesses that I'm a part of and the
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.400]   progress that I can create. So that may be okay. And I'll just pay myself a salary to like fund my
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.760]   lifestyle. But that could be a way around this. To me, the biggest issue isn't how much money I have
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.080]   personally, the biggest issue is how much money I will have to put back into the world.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.800]   And the idea that then it goes to a place where it's profligately spent in a way that isn't
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:49.320]   accountable really bothers me. That idea bothers me a lot. David, that would cause me to attack,
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.640]   you know, more even more to the right if I could find somebody who understood that principle,
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:58.440]   because what I don't want to have is, you know, in the absence of social programs, like the problem
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.800]   that the republicans leave is this no man's land where then you're forced to believe that this one
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.440]   man for yourself, it's all about you, you can figure it out, you know, the rugged individualism.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.800]   That's just not realistic. Like I, I
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.640]   completely agree with you. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.360]   I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.480]   a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.640]   And the problem is that republicans don't give you that option to have then accountability on
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.960]   spending. And just somebody please just say that I don't care what you call yourself.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.600]   Yeah, well, look, I think, you know, the I think republicans have gotten a lot more comfortable
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.400]   with the idea of entitlements and the social safety net. I don't really hear anyone opposing
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:43.160]   that anymore. I mean, it's the same things happened with like the Tories in England. No one's really trying
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.800]   to roll back the social safety net. We need a republican message to come forward and say,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:55.000]   listen, we don't care, you know, who you love, what you smoke, where you're from, what you look
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.320]   like, you know, we believe in an opportunity society, we want to spread that option to
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.480]   everybody. But ultimately, opportunity comes from the private sector, we're going to have a strong
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.760]   social safety net. And we're going to basically give everybody the most opportunity to participate
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.200]   by giving them a great education. That's basically what the agenda should be.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:12.840]   Yeah, I'm in.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.080]   I'm in. I mean, to your point,
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.360]   Even the starting line. Hallelujah.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.920]   I like it. I mean, I would, I've
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.280]   The problem is your boy tried to dismantle Obamacare, you know, unfortunately.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.840]   The problem is Trump, like Trump, I'm a never Trumper, obviously, but I'm kind of purple,
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.920]   I would, you know, I'm considering Austin or Miami as a place to locate myself. And
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.000]   a decision like this makes it easier.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.280]   I would never do that.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.760]   I'm actually very, I love Texas. I love Austin. Austin's the kind of purple I like.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.520]   Like I like personal freedom. And
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.960]   I like what you're saying, like love who you love smoke what you want.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.400]   What year did you move to the Bay Area?
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.120]   Five, six years ago. I was in LA for 10, New York for 30.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.400]   I feel like it's a last in first out thing that's going on right now with respect to
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.520]   immigration out of California.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.480]   Yeah. I've been here since 2000. I'm not leaving.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:04.120]   Yeah, I've been here since I was six years old in California, and I'm not leaving. And I've been in
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.520]   the Bay Area since college. So I'm not, you know, I feel like it's a lot harder to leave when you've
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.200]   been here longer. It's a lot easier to leave when you've been here less time. That certainly seems to
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.960]   be the pattern I've seen amongst friends and colleagues with respect to leaving the state.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.800]   All right. The Chauvin trial came back guilty all three charges.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.320]   What is there to even talk about here? What is there to talk about?
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.920]   I don't even know. I mean, I feel like we should.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.960]   Can I give it, can I give a shout out to a really good friend of mine? His name is Neil Kotschall. He
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:41.880]   was the former Solicitor General under Obama. He, he was one of the prosecutors that worked on that.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:48.440]   He's a, he's a partner at Hogan's, runs a Supreme Court practice there, but basically went and did
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:55.000]   this pro bono trial on behalf of the state of Minnesota, working with the, the district attorney.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.960]   And I'm just, I just want to say Neil, proud of you. It's an incredible thing. Thank you for
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.800]   keeping America safe. Okay.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:10.200]   I mean, you know, what's crazy is like, but then, you know, the same day there was a shooting of
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.560]   this, this unfortunate shooting. And I was like, I'm going to go to the Supreme Court. I'm going to
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.120]   go to the Supreme Court. I'm going to go to the Supreme Court. I'm going to go to the Supreme Court.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.760]   I think, I think she was 16 year old, 16 years old, this black girl in Ohio. And then, you know,
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.360]   LeBron tweeted something out and then LeBron had to basically delete the tweet because it was
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.920]   causing people to go absolutely crazy. Well, I mean, each of these situations
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.560]   is unique. And in that situation, somebody was going to stab another person. The cop didn't
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.280]   know what was going to happen. And, you know, in another time period, like maybe that would have
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:41.000]   been saving somebody's life who had potentially been stabbed and, you know, the George Floyd, I
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:41.240]   think he had a real life story.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   I think you got to reserve judgment on each of these until you get all the information. But the
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.560]   information here was just super conclusive. Like the gymnastics, Ben Shapiro, and some of these
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:57.400]   far right people had to go through to say what you saw in George Floyd being murdered was not what
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.560]   happened. Well, that's, that's performative theater trying to get people to watch something.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.160]   And it was, I mean, it was just gross to watch. Might as well call it what it is like that's
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:10.520]   acting. I feel like probably if anybody, if any one of us found Ben Shapiro in a bar and just hung
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:10.920]   out and had a beer. Yeah.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.080]   You'd find out that he was like, he was like the Meryl Streep of our generation,
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.320]   you know, like this incredible actor. What does that mean?
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.240]   Like an incredible actor.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:24.200]   Well, no, I mean, I think Scott Adams and his podcast, all these guys are just trying to figure
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.640]   out how to say that this was a travesty of justice. And I'm like, I don't know what you saw, but.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:35.000]   Yeah. Let me explain where they went wrong. Okay. So, so look, I, I, I agree with you guys.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.600]   Fundamentally, this was an easy, look, this, this was, uh, you know, a finding a fact by the jury.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:48.280]   Guilty on all charges, obvious, right? The tape shows it, his, uh, the Chauvin's, uh, record as a
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.640]   cop, numerous complaints, you know, this was a bad apple. This was a bad cop. He deserved to be
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.680]   convicted. End of story. That's really the analysis should end. But of course the people
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.560]   on cable news would have nothing to say if that was the end of it. And so look, I think both the
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.280]   right and the left kind of went off the rails on this where you're the right kind of went off the
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   rails is you had, well, yeah. I mean, I think the right kind of went off the rails is you had, well,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:16.280]   what happened is you had Maxine waters, you know, come out and while the jury was still
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   deliberating, she was basically calling for activists to get more confrontational on the
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.080]   streets. If the verdict went the wrong way. And so then the defense helpful, not helpful.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.920]   Right. And so the, so then the, the defense made a motion saying that, uh, this, this was affecting
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:36.760]   the deliberations. There was no proof of that. The jewel, the, the judge ruled against that motion,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.960]   but he did. The judge reiterated his desire for the politicians.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:45.640]   To stop talking about the case. Right. And so then what happened is the right-wing commentators
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:51.640]   were criticizing Maxine waters and implying that, that there was an effort to try and coerce the
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:57.320]   jury. And there's no proof of that. Right. And, and, and, and I think there's the mistake is in
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:03.320]   somehow framing the Derek Chauvin as like a sacrificial lamb to the mob. He was not,
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:09.000]   he was guilty. He deserved it. That being said, I do think that the judge had a point that it would
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.920]   be helpful if these politicians would just stay out of it, stop commenting on it while the jury
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:20.840]   is deliberating. I think there was a legit point there. Um, but you know, the, the, the, the left
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:25.800]   made some, some weird comments as well. You had Nancy Pelosi made this really bizarre statement.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.440]   That was very strange. I think that was like a slip up of like,
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.960]   just trying to say something, not, I mean, being charitable, she was trying to say something nice
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.440]   that George Floyd is going to create a wave of justice. And that would be, that's, that's, that's,
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.640]   that would be, that's a great idea. She said, yeah, she said, thank you,
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.120]   George Floyd for sacrificing your life for, for justice. Yeah. That didn't come out exactly as
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.680]   she intended. No, no. I mean, because look, George Floyd did not go out that day intending to be
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:58.840]   a martyr. Um, no, you know, and, um, and so it, it, it sort of gay, it expressed kind of what
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:06.280]   she's thinking, which is how am I going to use this politically? Uh, you know, train pretty gross.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.200]   I think you're right. It came out gross for sure.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.960]   I think that's how they're trained. It's kind of like, you know, if you, if you take a
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.760]   finely tuned athlete in a sport and give them, you know, they're, they're just, they're reactive
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.000]   because they're so instinctual. I think it's kind of like this, she's an incredibly finely trained
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.560]   athlete and her domain is politics. And so, you know, what is that phrase? Uh, uh, every crisis
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.040]   is an opportunity kind of thing. So I think, yeah, I mean, they all flew there to be there for the,
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:37.400]   for the trial, et cetera. And that couldn't have helped the judge with, you know, the impartial
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.920]   jury and maybe that causes a mistrial. I mean, I don't know, David, you were an attorney.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:47.960]   Is there any chance on appeal that a maxi water quote like that could result in.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.400]   Well, the judge, the judge actually said that, that the defense could reserve that issue and
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.240]   use it on appeal. So yeah, they could use it, but I, but I don't think it's good. I don't think it's
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:02.920]   going to work unless they can prove that somehow the jury was contaminated by what they were
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.200]   hearing on TV or something like that. The judge's instructions were pretty clear.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.280]   Like I watched a couple of the ending days and he's very clear. Like he's like, guys, I don't
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.320]   want you to watch the news. You know, there's stuff like that. He was very directive in making
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:18.200]   sure that they tried to be as uncontaminated as possible. So I think the surface area for an appeal
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:22.760]   is pretty thin here. The fact that the police chief and everybody who worked with him said like,
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.080]   this is not standard this, and they just threw him right under the bus. They didn't want to be
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.280]   associated with this in any way. By the way, well, you know, they're,
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.120]   they're not going to be able to hide much longer though. Cause the DOJ said they're over, they're,
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.880]   the DOJ said they're opening an investigation at the Minnesota police force. So I think they're
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.400]   just trying to crack open the police reform in that state and just get those guys on the right
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.720]   side. And it's going to be, you know, again, here's this other issue where it's like, okay,
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:49.080]   this is where like there it's very difficult for the federal government to do anything,
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.560]   but you know, so whatever they try to do won't really result in what, what you want to have,
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.040]   because every state, again, Jason, to your point has completely different political ideologies.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.320]   Nobody wants to behave the same. Everybody wants to be independent. Everybody wants to get
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:07.800]   reelected as not kowtowing to somebody else. And so you just don't get these consistent outcomes.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.160]   And then people are forced to vote with their feet and move across the country,
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:15.480]   you know, to get a bunch of simple things that I think should be pretty consistent across the
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   entire country. The thing that I found particularly deranged was these people who are like, listen,
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:24.840]   he's a fentanyl addict. He's an opioid addict, which by the way, there are tons of affluent
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:30.520]   people. Everybody in this country is addicted to opioids. Fentanyls are everywhere. And then you're
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:35.720]   trying to say like, because he had that addiction, but in some way that negates the person kneeling on
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:41.160]   his back while he's in handcuffs. Like you're you have a duty as a police officer to take care of
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.680]   somebody when he's in handcuffs. How is he any threat in any way and then to listen to Scott
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:53.320]   Adams and Ben Shapiro on these absolute pieces of garbage try to say, oh, you know, there was the
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:59.000]   fentanyl that killed him. It's like, yeah, no, the person on his back kneeling on him for nine minutes.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.560]   Because it's about ratings. Now, switching topics and to talk about ratings,
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:09.960]   something a little lighter. The most interesting popcorn thing that I watched was the Hulu
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.080]   documentary. You did watch the Hulu documentary on WeWork?
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.960]   On WeWork, yeah. I gotta watch it. I gotta watch it.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.000]   I haven't seen it yet. Yeah.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.040]   Oh, it is in a word. I think the right word is like, outrageous. I think the guy who stole it,
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.440]   Jason, was the lawyer who they interviewed. Yep.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.200]   He had some incredible kind of like one-liners. One-liners.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:35.960]   Yeah. I think it's, yeah, the- I had a, I'll be honest, and this may sound crazy,
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:41.800]   but I actually had a fair amount of sympathy for Adam Neumann in watching it. I think that he,
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:49.160]   at least in the documentary, it came out that he, you know, not that he didn't create this issue,
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.600]   but that I think it was a little overly scapegoated because it's very hard for you
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.400]   to incinerate $45 billion without the complicity at a minimum of your board of directors.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.320]   Right? And, and a bunch of like extremely well-heeled thoughtful investors. And so there
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.800]   was just, there was just this so much complicity in this thing. So if anything, my takeaway was
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:13.320]   that he, he shares, he shares the blame with a lot of other people and it's not, it wasn't,
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.200]   you know, him and him only, but my gosh, that documentary, some of the things guys are just,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.520]   they're fabulous. But this is, this is always true in these
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.200]   businesses that end up with, you know, bad actors that are enabled, right? I mean, it's been the
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:32.360]   case in public and public success stories and failures, right? I mean, there's a cult of
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.720]   personality. The personality provides that the high beta personality provides the alpha
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:44.600]   and it can also provide like a Theranos outcome. And you know, the, the thing that you'll see
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.440]   when you watch this is, I don't know if you guys watched the vow about that NXIVM cult,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:56.040]   which is just equally loathsome, horrible people behaving badly, but he really targeted young people
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:01.080]   to work there and indoctrinated him into this. We're changing the world. And then there were
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:06.520]   no adults there. And you see him behind the scenes when he's talking at the IPO road show,
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:12.920]   and he's having basically a panic attack and he's psychotic. I mean, he was really deranged
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.760]   and they have this video of him trying to get through the IPO road show. What show is it?
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:24.920]   What movie is this? It's the, we work documentary documentary. It is so deranged. It's awesome.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   Deranged is a big word. I don't, I'm not sure that it's deranged, but I think it's like,
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.480]   it's juicy. It's a, it's gossipy. What about his wife and like that whole thing?
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:41.640]   Like we school they're like, we have to democratize education for 60,000 a year.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:46.280]   Have you guys ever regretted enabling, um, you know,
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.880]   quirky personality entrepreneurs that you've backed and then you've regretted it later.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.760]   Yeah. So, um, the, the problem is it's hard, it's hard to know in the midst of it,
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.040]   you know, I guess it's like kind of like that line, like the line between
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:03.000]   genius and insanity is very thin. Um, but yeah, I mean, the, the one thing I will say is I've
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:11.320]   only ever had one issue of outright fraud. Um, and so, you know, well, no, I mean, in, in hundreds
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.280]   of, in hundreds of companies that I've, that I've invested in, luckily I I've, I've only,
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:24.600]   uh, I've only seen one issue where, you know, the CEO was extremely, I don't know, aggressive in,
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:30.200]   how they accounted for and book revenue. And, you know, this is where one thing that we don't have
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.000]   at the early stage companies, we don't have the check and balance of a reporting infrastructure
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.320]   and a third party watchdog and all these other people. And so, you know, you guys all know this
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.280]   when we go in and we sit in a meeting in a board meeting and, you know, the entrepreneur
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.960]   puts slides up, there is an inherent 100% categorical belief that they're, that they
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.440]   aren't lying, right? Like you don't, you don't even have to check that assumption. It's just assumed
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.160]   that nobody's lying, you know, good or bad, we're just presenting the data. And I had one case where
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:05.560]   the guy lied and it wasn't one was, it was, and our CFO and, you know, our team figured it out.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.680]   And, um, you know, there were other investors and it was, uh, we all were just really shocked and we
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:18.200]   had to kind of clean it up as best we could. And I have literally a dozen, uh, and they, we didn't
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:23.720]   wind up investing in, I think 10 of the 12. And the reason is we took diligence to your point.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.560]   Do you, how do you even know in a board meeting? I just said, screw it. I'm going to build a
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.920]   diligence team. And we ask people for all their bank statements and for their iTunes account and
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.640]   for their Google analytics. And if a company doesn't give those to us, we just know that
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.360]   something's up and we figure it out before we invest because the two times we did get dinged
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.280]   on this, we had one where somebody was giving themselves a loan and paying.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.240]   So you did diligence.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.600]   We did. We just basically have a diligence list that says,
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.120]   give us the incorporation docs and all these bank statements. Now somebody could
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:59.160]   fraudulently change a bank statement that is possible. So there, it depends on how deep
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.520]   people want to go in the fraud.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.240]   But did you guys ever like enable a personality that was just like, so over the top and then
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.680]   you're like, oh shit, this is actually going to, this is actually an explosion. Like it's
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.400]   a total disaster.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.840]   Only my top three investments.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.760]   Well, actually that's a good point there.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:15.720]   That's a good point, right?
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.720]   Yeah. So because, okay. So I wrote about this in my blog post blitz fail
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.960]   about the sort of how, how founder psychology can actually cause a company to go off the
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.280]   rails.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.240]   Oh, it's in offense.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:31.880]   The thing, the thing is that founder founders do need to be much more aggressive than the
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   average person. You know, we like to think that a quality, that a personality trait,
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.120]   like aggressiveness, there's like some sort of normal distribution of it. And you kind of want
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:45.000]   to be, you know, somewhere in the middle of the curve and it's actually not true. You want founders
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.240]   to be much more aggressive than the average person, because if they're not, they're just
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.800]   not going to persevere and push hard enough. Right. And Jay, I mean, we saw,
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.320]   we saw this with, with Uber, right? I mean, TK was a super aggressive personality.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.240]   The company would not have been as successful. How do you not push that hard? And so
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:06.040]   the curve in the real world, it's not a normal distribution. It looks more like
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.680]   a curve where there are returns to aggressiveness and they're keeping increasing returns to it
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.000]   until suddenly the person goes too far and then they jumped the shark and the whole thing craters.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.920]   But wait, can I, can I say something like, you know, having been in the
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:23.640]   engine room with Zuck in a critical moment, Zuck was an aggressive guy, but he wasn't over the
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.720]   top and he wasn't just this like crazy weirdo personality. He wasn't enabling sexual harassment.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.160]   Was he thoughtful? He wasn't doing any of that stuff.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.200]   Would you say? Yeah. He was, he was, he was, he was,
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.480]   he was an intellectually incisive, he was an aggressive thinker. So this is why my reaction
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:44.120]   to David's question is I haven't backed assholes because I just think that that archetype doesn't
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.200]   work. Zuck's a very cool analytical
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:52.920]   personality. There are these founders that, you know, we, um, I've heard the term wild stallion to,
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.480]   uh, to destroy.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.240]   Describe them where they are, you know, they're like these, these wild stallions,
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:02.280]   they have tremendous upside, but they're also a little bit, you know, um, wild and unless they
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.800]   sort of learn to. You can get hit with the hoof.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:10.600]   Yeah. I mean, they're, they're, they're, they've got a lot of talent, right? Uh, the, the, the
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.080]   talent is the amount of talent you have is like the horse you're riding on. And some people are
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.680]   riding on a Bronco. They got a lot of talent, but it might buck them off.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:23.320]   I just think the real, the real edge in investing is figuring out what is blood,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.480]   luster and window dressing and show. And what is actually aggressive thinking like
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:31.080]   John and Patrick Collison. There's zero bluster with those guys.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.400]   Yeah. Those guys are Shopify zero.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.360]   That company is going to be zero. That's going to be the most valuable,
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.680]   valuable company that's private right now. Besides these guys are, these guys are incredible,
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.400]   intellectually thoughtful killers, right? That's what they are.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.640]   That's true. They out, they out think everybody,
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:49.000]   but there's also a maturation process. A lot of founders go through, right? I mean,
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.160]   the Colson's and Zuck, I think got very mature, very young.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:58.200]   I think there's other founders that it takes them a while to get more polished,
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:04.520]   get more disciplined, reign in that, you know, those emotions. I'm not saying they're fraudulent.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:09.720]   We don't want to bet on fraudulent founders, but some founders need to learn how to harness
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.920]   the talent they have.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.600]   Yeah. I agree with that. I agree with that.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.080]   And those are the ones where it's very hard to know earlier in their career,
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:22.120]   whether to bet on them or not. Right. Because they may get it under control or they may not. It's,
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.000]   you can't tell at the beginning.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.720]   Here's the analogy we use internally. It's like being professor X and the X-Men,
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.480]   you could have a Jean gray or a Wolverine and like, everybody's got a different superpower,
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:36.120]   but you need to teach them how to use that superpower so they don't self-destruct or cause
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:36.280]   chaos.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.960]   They can bifurcate the other way, right?
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.560]   They could be Magneto, right? You could, it could go the other way.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.720]   Not sure I get all the references, but I hear you.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:49.080]   Well, I mean, I'm kind of shocked given how much of a huge nerd you are that you don't
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.840]   understand the X-Men. I love that movie. I love that movie with the guy who's made
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:58.200]   of all the rocks and the little tree guy. Who's his buddy. That's a Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.600]   I think, I think Jason's favorite character is the blob.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.120]   Is that the one?
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:08.360]   That's coming from you? You brought COVID-20, I dropped COVID-15. What are you talking about?
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.840]   How many, how many of those Cubano sandwiches are you having? Look at your face, dude.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.840]   How many cro, no croquetas, Sax.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.200]   Are you right? I shouldn't have gotten there.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.640]   Side salad.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.160]   Bad idea. I shouldn't have gotten there. You're right.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.680]   Side salad.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.080]   I started training.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.120]   Well, Sax, what is your health plan? Are you, now that we're coming out of COVID,
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:28.920]   are you running or like?
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.440]   Yes, we got an intervention right now. What's the plan?
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.400]   You look terrible.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:37.080]   You do look a little bloated. You look like a, you look like a puffed fish.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.560]   Oh, geez. I need to lose like 20 pounds.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.000]   A puffed fish.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.800]   I'm down 12 from my peak of the COVID peak. I'm feeling good.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.040]   Just get a personal trainer.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.680]   Speaking of COVID, what the hell is going on in India?
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.400]   Oh my lord.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:49.640]   It's brutal.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.200]   It's scary.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.520]   I thought the whole thing was we would, they were taking hydroxychloroquine
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.840]   for totally different reasons and this is why it's all fine.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:59.240]   Or that they had some immunity or that it was hot. I mean, there was a million reasons of why
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:04.280]   they were not going to get hit and then now they're surging and we have 60 million shots
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.240]   on the shelf and the number of people getting shots is going down. This is America's chance
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:17.000]   to use instead of battleships and nuclear weapons, we can use this COVID to shape global policy.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.360]   We should be getting vaccines to other countries and be once again,
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.960]   the shining light of the entire planet and humanity.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.520]   Well, why are we not bringing shots to India now?
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.840]   We have so many extra.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.240]   I'm not sure. I'm just trying to pull up the India vax data per day. I'm not sure that there's a,
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.680]   that's as much the issue, right?
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:44.600]   I mean, it is scary to watch their, I mean, you're our go-to science guy,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.680]   Freeberg. Tell us what we're looking at here on this chart. I mean, the daily COVID cases
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.680]   are now hitting 250,000.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.200]   350,000.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.480]   300,000 a day, Jason, right now.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.560]   It broke 300. Oh my Lord. And the United States has gotten down to like 50, 60.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:05.320]   India is now past the peak of the US. You know, India is now seeing more cases per day than any
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:11.160]   country has seen worldwide during the whole pandemic at over, you know, 300,000 a day right
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.640]   now. And it's, you know, it doesn't seem to be letting up and we're now questioning whether it's
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.680]   testing. That's the limiting factor in terms of reporting on these cases. So it's pretty nasty.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.040]   Now there's a famous,
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.400]   famous Indian politician who,
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:31.960]   who had been double vaxxed, who claims that he is COVID positive as is his mother and sister.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.880]   And so it's also creating a little bit of a concern in the market about, you know, getting
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:44.200]   COVID. Now he doesn't seem to be having a severe case, which is, you know, one of the kind of
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.920]   important things to take note of in vaccination is it's not necessarily binary. But it's certainly
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.880]   making a, a lot of sense. Yeah.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.680]   lot of creating a lot of fear uh as a result of his um kind of public statement about this
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:05.240]   this isn't just about cases either um 30 days ago they were at 200 deaths a day and uh i mean
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:13.160]   tragically they're at 2100. so it's 10x in 30 days if it 10x is again that's 20 000 people a day
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.800]   dying this is a different level than any other country has experienced tragic and they don't
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.880]   look at the end at the end of the day they don't have the the hospitals hospitals to handle this do
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.760]   they this could become a crisis of epic proportions at the end of the day a country's success in
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.840]   battling cove it's going to be about how fast they can get their population vaccinated it's very
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.680]   simple right i mean israel was first they got everyone vaccinated now their cases are down to
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.360]   almost nothing the us is doing pretty well although there's some room for concern we were doing you
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:47.080]   know close to four million vaccinations a day now we're at like three three and a half they're
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:47.720]   starting to slip
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.600]   a little bit um and that doesn't have to do with johnson and johnson right that has to do with
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.320]   people not showing up for appointments yeah and i think you got to blame the media a little bit
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:02.040]   because they keep running all these vaccine scare stories about you know how this person or that
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.320]   person the vaccine punched through and they got sick despite getting the vaccine they keep selling
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   they keep selling all this like you know covid um scary and porn you know the the fear point
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.920]   do you know what i noticed the other day on cnn this is how insincere and
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.840]   um ratings desperate they are when they put up their covet stats they put up cumulative cases
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.040]   and cumulative deaths that's what they obsess on and it's like hey dummies we know what you're
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.560]   doing here you're trying to scare people you should show the graph of the debts going down
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.320]   and then why can't you take your mask off if you're vaccinated and you're outside
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.960]   reward you were talking about this last week yeah nate silver had a really good tweet about
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.600]   this he said that wearing a mask after you're vaccinated is now it's like the the blue equivalent
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.720]   of the red maga hat where it's completely performative to say hey i'm on team blue
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:57.160]   you know even though like scientifically it's meaningless i it's like the press they keep
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:03.560]   talking about this possibility that even after you're vaccinated and you could somehow you know
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.280]   keep transmitting the virus to other people look viruses i mean freebird can explain this better
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:14.040]   than me but viruses do not have in themselves the machinery for replication right they have to take
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.720]   over your cells hijack your cells machinery to replicate themselves so first they have to infect
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.840]   somebody then that person gets you know gets the virus starts producing a lot of it then they start
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.920]   shedding it if you don't get really sick you're not going to be shedding a lot of the virus you're
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.320]   not going to be transmitting it to a lot of other people and you know they talk about this this
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.920]   possibility as if it's like a real possibility that people could still be transmitting the
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:44.040]   virus after they're vaccinated i mean it's not a statistically relevant possibility right it's kind
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.880]   of a gray scale it comes down to this interpretation of everything being binary and the reality is
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:55.160]   that all of this is on um you know a a a statistical curve or on a kind of a gray scale
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.840]   and you know the sax's point is a hundred percent correct that the probability of someone who's been
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.480]   double vaccinated getting infection getting infected and then being infectious in a
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   meaningful way is so remote um that it is not even worth kind of considering uh in a way and and
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:13.960]   being double vaccinated
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.600]   such a significant typically right not for everyone right all immune systems are different
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:23.960]   and some of what we we might be seeing is the difference in kind of how people develop immunity
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   um but it is such a rare case that one could have a severe infection after getting a uh you know a
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.400]   vaccination um is such that it it shouldn't even be considered and kind of you know mentioned as
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.800]   being a reason for continuing to wear masks and not gather and not do things and so you know we
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.880]   started out as sax pointed out and i think this is such a true and important point we started
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.920]   out with this like immediate politis politicization of what's the right thing to do to
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.040]   reduce the spread of the virus and then that became the mainstay for that political affiliation
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:59.160]   and now the transition of the new world that we live in where most people are vaccinated
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.880]   we have a better understanding of the science and the statistics and the mechanisms of transmission
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:09.320]   we hold on and we grasp on to that initiating kind of belief system
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.800]   that was correct at the time but isn't correct anymore and it is
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.920]   it seems so difficult to get people to shift their mind this kind of um this behavior is an ignorant
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:25.000]   behavior and you see it in so many manifestations um uh right now uh in particular with respect to
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.680]   masks and behavior after vaccination and so on uh and it's uh it's really brutal to watch um but we
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:36.280]   obviously digress a bit from the indian uh circuit the indian circumstance which is a really nasty one
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:41.160]   so it looks like why why now and not a year ago you know it's it's not clear right so there's um
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.720]   someone uh uh provided a
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.400]   indication today that there may be as many as somewhere between 100 and 200 unique variants
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.040]   that we're seeing emerge in india so there may be a a lot of interesting very interesting
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:07:00.600]   technically but not obviously for human life but a lot of dramatic um variants or significant
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:06.520]   variants uh that might be increasing the the infectiousness right now um and uh and in
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.920]   particular uh you know behavior has shifted in a way that's enabling you know some of these
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.640]   transmissions to occur you know a lot of people let their guard down and so
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:19.880]   on in a way that maybe they weren't six months ago um and uh you know there may be some forced
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.960]   evolution associated with partial vaccination totally a theory right now where you know 110
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:31.560]   million doses have been given in india so far so you know in order for a virus to succeed the viral
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:36.760]   variants that are going to infect more likely um you know through a partially transmitted
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.040]   a partially vaccinated population are the ones that are winning out
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.240]   so there's a lot of you know confounding factors here we're not really sure
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:50.920]   um but it is uh it is pretty brutal um what is uh what is going on um i will say like this notion
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.000]   that vaccination does not prevent uh protection against variants is not a binary statement either
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.200]   this is really really important i've been wanting to say this for a couple of our shows when you get
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.520]   this vaccine um what you're doing is you're training your cells you're giving yourselves the
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:12.120]   rna to print the spike protein and that protein is now in your body everyone's immune system then
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.160]   reacts differently and then it's like you're giving yourself the rna to print the spike protein and
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:13.480]   then you're giving yourself the rna to print the spike protein and then you're giving yourself the rna to
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:19.000]   to create antibodies to that protein the antibodies that chamath makes and jason makes and sax makes
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.600]   and i make are all going to be different but if you had to pick whose would be better i mean
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:27.240]   i could tell you sax is probably going to be the worst off but yeah jason's sort of the most
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:33.560]   sluggish for sure they're the slowest yeah but there are likely tens of thousands of novel
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.440]   variants that our b cells will make that will that will bind to that spike protein and get rid of it
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.080]   and we will each have many hundreds or potentially thousands of novel antibodies that our immune system will create.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:52.040]   we'll make so keep that in mind you now have a portfolio of antibodies that your body is producing to that spike protein so now when when a when a covid uh when the
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.360]   sars cov2 virus shows up in your body some of those proteins some of those antibodies are going to be
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.960]   really effective at getting rid of it some of them are not now the protein in the sars cov2 virus
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.360]   changes slightly some of the other antibodies you have are going to be effective and some of the
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:12.280]   other ones are not and it is that portfolio that is um that is going to change sorry that portfolio
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:18.840]   that is going to define your success at fighting off a specific variant of sars cov2 where the spike
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.760]   protein is changing slightly with each variant right so these variants change the composition
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.840]   of the protein the antibodies that you have are going to be you know more or less successful
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.280]   depending on how that variant changes and that's um where there may be cases where the number of
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   antibodies that you are producing or the success of the antibodies that you particularly have
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.520]   are a little bit lower for a particularly new variant it doesn't mean that you're going to have
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   an infection that's going to be a runaway infection in your body it means that it might take you
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.160]   longer or it might be a little bit harder for you to clear that particular variant given the
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.880]   repertoire of antibodies that you've produced and that's why this isn't that's why this isn't binary
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.280]   right it could be that it's like hey this variant shows up boom instantly i got rid of it i don't
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.400]   have any infection but someone else might have like you know maybe a slight bit of um uh you
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.200]   know there might be a couple days where they'll feel a cold as your body's going to get rid of it
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.840]   and the other way that that could happen is that they're not going to be able to get rid of it so
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.200]   you're going to have to do something like a blood test to see if that's going to be the best way to
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.080]   get rid of it and then the other way is you're going to have to do something like a blood test
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.440]   to see if that's going to be the best way to get rid of it and so that's why this is a very important
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.440]   thing to do and so that's why we've been doing this for a long time and so i think that's going to be
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.720]   a very important thing to do and so i think that's why we've been doing this for a long time and so
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.120]   we're going to have to do it a little bit more often and so we're going to have to do it a little
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.440]   bit more often and so we're going to have to do it a little bit more often but we're going to have to
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.520]   do it a little bit more often but we're going to have to do it a little bit more often and so
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.760]   again like when viral variants start to emerge in the population and as they kind of take off
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.200]   um and become more dominant it doesn't mean that we don't have immunity it means that immunity
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.320]   might be slightly affected um but not not it's not one or zero right because you've got hundreds
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.360]   or thousands of antibodies to fight against covid in your body and i think that's really important
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.560]   so we should you know while there may be some variants that might be what we call variants of
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.360]   concern meaning they can kind of slip away a little bit from most of the antibodies you have
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.280]   these and so i don't know if that was too technical or too difficult to understand but i
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.160]   think it's really important it makes total sense yeah yeah and and and one thing just to add to that
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:15.480]   is is that most of the variants that the press keeps reporting with alarm that are somehow
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.400]   that that basically are going to be vaccine proof they turn out not to be
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:25.720]   you know that we they're very shortly uh there there comes out a new article basically saying
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.280]   that the vaccines work and so the press keeps reporting these isolated cases
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.320]   and so i think that's a really important thing to think about because i think that's a really important
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.200]   thing to think about because i think that's a really important thing to think about because

[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.440]   thing to think about because i think that's a really important thing to think about because
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.460]   what's going on with the SEC and SPACs and just some more
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.320]   reporting or something? Because I was watching CNBC, and they
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.420]   said, Hey, you're doing everything right. But there's a
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.640]   lot of other people are doing things wrong. Explain to us
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.260]   what's going on.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.740]   It's I mean, it's a it's a very specific accounting issue,
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.160]   which is that some specs many specs and in fact, many
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.260]   companies, let's just put it that way, not just backs, but
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.140]   many companies use warrants. And the prevailing guidance on
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.940]   certain warrants was that they were equity. And basically, that
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.860]   gets put into a balance sheet statement where you have
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.380]   equities, assets and liabilities. And you know, it
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:11.300]   sits on one side. And basically, what they said was they issued
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.580]   some refined guidance that said actually, in these specific
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:16.100]   cases, these should be really listed as liability. So then it
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.320]   needs to move from this column to that column. But when that
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.980]   when you do that, you go through, you know, a bunch of
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:25.400]   cascading implications and effects and, you know, revisions
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.280]   and restatements. And so that's what the that's what the entire
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.100]   securities industry is dealing with right now, which was,
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.220]   you know, this guidance by the SEC and the implication. So that
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.080]   was on the 12th. I mean, just so you know, today, we just filed
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.520]   the updated, all of our updated docs plus the updated s4 for so
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.920]   far, so we were able to work around the clock and just kind
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.040]   of get it done. And hopefully, what we've also done is create a
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.500]   bit of a way forward and a path that other folks can use to kind
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.460]   of like accelerate their their progress, but it's definitely
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:59.340]   created a ton of work. But, but we're I think we're I think we
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.960]   found the right answer. So ultimately,
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.120]   good for you, because you want to see it.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.280]   Yeah, and also, I think like the simpler path forward. So I mean,
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.420]   if you just think about capital market stability for a moment,
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.360]   like warrant coverage should probably go away. Number one,
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.180]   right, so take all the warrants to zero. Second thing that
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.820]   should happen is that, you know, I think this is an opportunity
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.340]   to take a step back and figure out how to really make sure that
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:23.340]   the SPAC sponsors are of the highest quality. Somebody told
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.880]   me this incredible thing today, I am one of five groups that put
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.460]   up any money when we do a pipe in our deals. Meaning, he's
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:36.580]   said to me, 95% of sponsors put up literally a zero, zero. And so
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.980]   of course, you're going to have, you know, extremely loose
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.440]   underwriting requirements, if that's the case. And so, you
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.040]   know, the idea that I'm thinking about, which someone proposed to
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.800]   me, which I think is very clever is this idea that, you know, you
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.600]   earn more of the promote more money you put up, right. So for
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.080]   example, like, you know, in, you know, in SoFi, I think we put in
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.980]   $275 million. So I mean, we really, we're really, we're really
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:04.420]   really, you know, that's a meaningful commitment. And it
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.320]   closes the gap between, you know, what your equity is issued
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.080]   at and what investors are buying at. And that's very healthy,
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.100]   right. And so I think there's all these mechanisms that will
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:19.740]   clean up the SPAC market, we need to have a much more refined
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:24.360]   criteria to allow people to be sponsors. And we need to make
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.480]   sponsors in a position where they must put in money, so that
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.760]   they actually do the work.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.020]   If you get something for free, let's be honest, you won't do the
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.480]   work. If you're forced to write a check, it's 100% about it,
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.460]   show me an incentive, I'll show you the outcome. And this
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:42.060]   happened on AngelList, where in the beginning days of AngelList,
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.720]   you had some angels, quote, unquote, who didn't have any
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.420]   money. So they put 1000 or 2000 into a deal, then they would
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.840]   have 500,000 come behind them. And so you had this 500 to one
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.620]   ratio of dollars to skin in the game. And it was like, well, why
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.660]   wouldn't a syndicate lead put every company in the game, and
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:57.720]   then they would have 500,000 come behind them. And so you had
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:57.780]   this 500 to one ratio of dollars to skin in the game. And it was
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:57.780]   like, well, why wouldn't a syndicate lead put every company in
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:02.740]   out there, and not even put it, you know, they have no skin,
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.560]   which is why when you have a venture fund, I don't know what
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.960]   they expect us to put in typically, well, the problem is
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.820]   venture funds are one to 2%. I was 25%. Well, one to 2% is it
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.860]   could be pretty significant. If you're doing a fund every three
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.440]   years, I'm doing this. And it's, it winds up being millions of
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.480]   dollars for me, but I'm happy to do it because I believe in my
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.360]   own ability. All right, as we wrap anybody have a plug or
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.920]   anything they want to let people know about?
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.280]   Oh, I want to talk about this one little thing. I just not to
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.760]   talk about it. But I would like to tell you guys to
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.800]   read it because it is so interesting. Basically, like
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.340]   European soccer tried to incite a revolt, where like the top
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.760]   teams across all the different leagues came together to try to
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.820]   create a Super League, but it ended up like they were like a
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:45.880]   band of evil villains and like fans erupted, everybody erupted.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:49.460]   And then, you know, it existed for 24 hours. But in that 24
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:53.800]   hours, it looked like a complete rewriting of sports and sports,
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.740]   like laws and you know, it was
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.720]   an incredible thing. There's an article in the New York Times,
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.520]   I'll post it in here and folks want to read it. It's really,
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520]   really fucking funny.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.220]   And that will be on season two of Ted Lasso. I don't know if
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:11.420]   you guys watched Tim Cook's keynote this week with the new
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:15.900]   IMAX, which are really beautiful. He was so excited
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:19.040]   about Ted Lasso and Ted Lasso is a great show. But I mean, it
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.300]   literally is the the Apple show. Do you guys see Ted Lasso yet?
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.040]   What is it this television show?
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.260]   You guys haven't seen Ted Lasso the TV show yet?
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.540]   Is it on NBC or CBS? What channel is it on?
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.460]   TV plus, whatever that is.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.500]   Channel six? Is it on channel six?
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:37.560]   TV plus, you got to go on your Apple TV and then find an Apple
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.060]   TV plus on your TV. And you'll find it eventually. It's one of
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.160]   their paid, you know, they have their own Netflix competitor
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.900]   called Apple TV plus. So on your phone, if you type Apple TV,
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:49.860]   you'll have Apple TV.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.660]   I have Apple TVs. I have Apple TVs behind my TV.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.720]   No, no, but there's Apple TV plus, which is their Netflix. So
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.580]   there's a better
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:57.700]   is it a better Apple TV?
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.940]   No, no, no, it's content. It's a content subscription you could
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:06.100]   have. They just, they screwed that part up. Hey, shout out. I
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:06.740]   just wanted to get
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:09.160]   sorry. So who's who's Ted Lasso?
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.120]   Ted Lasso is adjacent to Dacus comedy that is incredibly
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.500]   heartwarming, about a really heartwarming, joyful, kind
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.820]   person who goes from America to the UK to become a soccer coach.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:27.360]   Yeah, really great. I hate it's boring. That sounds really
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:27.680]   common.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.720]   Mind you, it's not cynical. I do. I hate it.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:38.500]   You should watch. You should watch Gamora on HBO. I started it. Yeah, woof. On time. Yeah,
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:45.520]   I got the first episode. Oh, here we go. It is so super. And also, you should watch it in the
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.300]   original language because it's not really Italian. It's like Neapolitan. And so like, you know, I can
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:55.100]   catch and understand maybe 20% of the words and I said to Nat I said, What language is she's like,
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.660]   I had no idea. I watched it in Italian subtitles. So it
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:01.860]   was, it was beautiful. It's beautiful. Beautiful. It's so
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:05.280]   intense. It's like the wire but like I mean, you know, set in
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.180]   Italy. It's incredible.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:09.440]   Afterlife is also good Ricky Gervais. If you want something
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.940]   cynical and heartwarming. That's for you, Sax. Love you guys.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.420]   Love you, Sax. I'll see you.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.780]   Actually, what can you just come back to the Bay Area so we can
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.620]   play poker? Yeah.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:22.020]   When he just wanted to Miami Are we going to Miami?
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:25.740]   I'm going to I'm going on a trip. I'll just leave it at that.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:26.160]   I'll talk to you guys.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.040]   Recognizance trip. What?
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.400]   Recognizance?
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.620]   Yeah, recognizance. I'm gonna be able to understand what's going on.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:41.640]   Do you understand that that term is more associated with bail and in jail than it is what you think it
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.140]   means?
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:46.880]   Jason, you are released on your own recognizance.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.100]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:50.200]   You want to do reconnaissance?
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.320]   Reconnaissance. That's what I said. Reconnaissance.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.760]   Yeah, I think you'd be wearing an ankle bracelet on your
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.620]   recognizance.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:01.720]   Actually, no, they don't fit on his ankles.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.820]   I always have to mispronounce one word to make it a good episode.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.580]   For Jason, it'll be a cankle bracelet.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:12.080]   You can't talk, Mr. Doughboy. What are you talking about?
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:12.580]   My God.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:17.840]   What? Is it called a bracelet if your calf and your ankle are the same circumference?
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.380]   Put it this way. If Sax is wearing two of them right now, you'd never know.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.880]   Sax is wearing one on his neck. What happened to your neck, Sax?
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.380]   We're out.
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:26.900]   We're out.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.600]   We're out.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:27.760]   We're out.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.020]   Where's your neck, Jabba?
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:29.540]   See ya.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.260]   See ya.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.660]   Jabba the Hutt over here.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:32.900]   Love you guys.
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:33.440]   Love you.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.320]   Love you, besties.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:34.800]   Bye-bye.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.720]   We'll see you all next time.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.440]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.320]   Rain Man, David Sax.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:48.120]   And it said, we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.100]   Love you, besties.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.400]   Queen of Kinwa.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.180]   I'm going all in.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.760]   Let your winners ride.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   Besties are gone.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.080]   Go 13.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:02.020]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:02.520]   Sax.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.160]   Wait, no, no.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:03.660]   Oh, man.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.160]   Oh, man.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:04.660]   Oh, man.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.160]   Oh, man.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.760]   My avatars will meet me at .
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.040]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:11.540]   used to this.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:14.540]   It's like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.540]   Wet your feet.
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:18.540]   Wet your feet.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:19.540]   Wet your feet.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.540]   We need to get merch.
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:21.540]   Besties are back.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.540]   I'm going all in.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.540]   What?
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.540]   What?
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.540]   What?
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:26.540]   What?
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.540]   What?
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.500]   What?
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   What?
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.500]   What?
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.500]   What?
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.500]   What?
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:33.500]   What?
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:33.500]   What?
