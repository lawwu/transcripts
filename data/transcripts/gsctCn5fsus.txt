[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.840]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600]   where every week we get great questions
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.800]   from you, the viewers.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.400]   Remember our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.720]   Duncan, how's it going?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.880]   - Pretty good, pretty good, how are you?
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.720]   - I'm great.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.340]   We're brought to you today by bird dogs.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.720]   I just this week got a new pair of the bird dogs
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.360]   stretch khakis.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.200]   It's nice, I have to look nice sometimes,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.520]   dress up a little bit, but also be comfortable.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.000]   You can buy them with or without the liner.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.480]   The liner's pretty key, it's kinda nice.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.560]   - You're a big liner guy.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.240]   I actually, I like the, I have a pair without,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   I like 'em.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.880]   - Yeah, both are good.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.720]   We're still giving away,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.520]   they're still giving away these dad tech hats.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.980]   This one's got your name on it, Duncan.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.440]   So if you go to birddogs.com/ATC
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.480]   or enter promo code ATC, you can get that.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.540]   They also have great, great polos.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.180]   I've been using the shorts lately just for working out
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.020]   because it's too cold to wear 'em outside anymore.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.660]   The polos are nice, it's great.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.140]   Birddogs.com/ATC to find more.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380]   - They're also our record sponsor here on Ask the Condown.
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140]   They have sponsored more shows than anyone else.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.300]   - Okay, so they've been on more than Bill Sweet even.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300]   - They have, they actually have, yeah.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.140]   So I appreciate that.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.220]   - They should make a pair of raw thigh raise for us.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.260]   All right, let's get into it.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.580]   Good questions today.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.320]   Yeah, so up first today, we have a question from Chris.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.240]   I'm 55 with a net worth of $1.1 million.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.520]   I'm a software consultant
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.100]   and quite bullish on my income rising.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.740]   Definitely live below our means,
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.960]   our kids will be highly competitive to get into top schools
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.360]   where it's estimated that four years will cost $250,000.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.780]   In saving for his education,
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.800]   the money has been going into a couple of brokerage accounts,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.920]   $30,000 in Lyft off, which I never pay attention to,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580]   and $226,000 in E-Trade.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.000]   Guess I've gotten lucky with E-Trade
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.040]   because it has done pretty well over the years.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.880]   This is in large part due to early investments
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   in Tesla and NVIDIA, not bad.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.580]   I'm pretty bullish on both of these stocks,
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.820]   but what do I know?
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.780]   I'm deliberating the following choices.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.840]   One, liquidate both stocks
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.720]   and stuff into a high-interest 15-month CD.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.800]   Two, liquidate everything in the account
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.480]   but those two stocks and stuff into a CD.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   Three, hold tight.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.900]   The plan is to use loans for the first year,
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.940]   so we will need to start tapping into the money
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.080]   in the fall of 2025.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.320]   What are your thoughts?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.600]   - So Chris actually sent us his statement here.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   We didn't include it, obviously,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.480]   but he's got massive gains in both of these stocks,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.720]   like 5,000% or something.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.600]   Why don't we bring in a guy who's been talking about NVIDIA
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.400]   for probably longer than Chris has been holding it.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.480]   Mr. Josh Brown.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.160]   - Hey!
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.440]   - Straight from CNBC to Ask the Compound.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.280]   - I wanted to say thank you guys for having me on the show.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.840]   I learn so much each week listening to you.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.960]   I want to address one person in the comments
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.320]   and then we can get rolling.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.920]   John Carlo asks, "Is Josh a subway guy or an Uber guy?"
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.320]   I guess 'cause I was late
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.200]   and you guys usually start at 1.30
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.040]   and we're getting rolling a little bit late.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.900]   - Yeah, I mentioned you were coming straight from NYSE.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.840]   - Yeah, so I don't do subways.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.960]   And it's not 'cause I think I'm too good for the subway.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.440]   It's literally just, it makes me so unhappy and depressed,
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.640]   I'd rather walk.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.960]   So I'm either always in a car or I'm walking
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.720]   and I will literally walk 40 blocks.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.360]   - You know what the worst part of the subway is for me
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.680]   as being someone who doesn't take it very often?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.520]   - Yeah.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.600]   - Grabbing one of the poles
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.760]   and the pole is long from the person who held it before you.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840]   - Yeah, I will absolutely not grab anything at all.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.220]   And what's funny is we have a dinner reservation
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.520]   somewhere downtown 'cause we work in Midtown Manhattan
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.360]   and Mike will be like,
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.320]   "Come on, just take the subway, it's quick."
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.980]   It doesn't matter if it's one second.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.200]   Every aspect of it is my worst nightmare.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.360]   And it's not the length, it's the walking down
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   knowing what you're about to do.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.320]   So I just, I can't do it, I'm sorry.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.560]   There's a lot of things I can't do.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.680]   That's one of the things I can't do.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.520]   All right, what are we doing?
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   - Pro tip two, never sit on the subway.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.660]   I've seen things. - Sit?
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.720]   - I've seen things, just don't do it.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.040]   - Listen to me, never stand on the subway.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.240]   All right, sorry.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.200]   So I'm facing the same dilemma as, what's his name?
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.360]   The guy that wrote that? - Chris.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.760]   - Chris, so he's sitting on these huge gains.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.600]   - Yeah.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.420]   - You might be in a different position.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.000]   I don't know if you have a goal to use this money for,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.520]   but he's saying, "I have this goal, I know how much I need.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.640]   "I'm gonna be spending it in two years."
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.320]   And he's already gotten, he needs 250 grand
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.560]   and he's gonna spend it.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.600]   - I'm in the same position.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680]   My daughter just applied to 12 colleges last month.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.140]   So someone's gonna take her.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.880]   So she's applying to schools
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.440]   that are gonna cost me money.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.040]   So I didn't hear 529 anywhere in what he said.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.440]   And obviously he doesn't own Tesla stock in a 529.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.400]   - Right, yeah, he said he's using brokerage accounts.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.680]   - Brokerage accounts, all right.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   So we liquidated all of our stock exposure
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.000]   for my daughter this year.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   Because we're using the money starting,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.520]   presumably, starting next fall.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.240]   So we specifically put away for this event,
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.960]   for both the kids, and we used, I think,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   the best possible vehicle you could have done it with.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.640]   - And the timing is pretty good,
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.240]   because you could actually earn something in cash now
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.680]   that you sold it, right?
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.000]   - Yes, I don't really care what happens to the market,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.880]   because this is now like, it doesn't make a difference.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.440]   This is, I know for a fact I need to use the money,
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.240]   so I just mentally said, if I'm leaving money on the table
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   because there's a stock market rally, whatever.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.640]   That's the nature of what we're doing now.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.160]   But we were invested in Vanguard
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.180]   because it's the New York State 529 plan.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.800]   So yeah, the S&P went up this year.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.640]   And I missed some of it, but it doesn't matter.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.760]   What I would do if I were him
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.040]   is I would keep Tesla and Nvidia,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   just because if you can liquidate everything else,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.280]   literally put it into something high yielding
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.680]   until you need it a year and a half from now,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.800]   that's the move.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.720]   Or when's he need it, fall '25?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.560]   - Yeah.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.800]   - So, all right, it's two years from now.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.640]   - John, give me a try out of Tesla and Nvidia drawdowns.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.280]   So last year, you saw these ones fall.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.440]   I mean, Tesla was down 73% and Nvidia was down 66%.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   So even sitting on huge gains,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.000]   that's the risk is that that money's not there when needed.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.080]   The good thing about the four-year thing
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.720]   is that you have time to space it out.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   So you could, like you said,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   you could leg out of the other stuff if you wanted to,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.360]   and it's not just those two stocks, but--
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.320]   - You would probably say the other way around though, right?
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.160]   You would probably tell him take the gains
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.360]   in the two solo stocks
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.320]   and try to hold onto the rest for another year?
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.160]   What would you tell him?
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.440]   - I would probably, if I know I'm gonna be spending
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.840]   this money in the next couple years, I would lock it in.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.980]   He's got the 250 he needs.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.460]   I wouldn't even, I mean, maybe keep 20% in the stock market
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.480]   if you really want something.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.160]   But other than that, I'm all for cashing it out
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.840]   and sitting and keep going chill or whatever.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.240]   - I think I am too.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.200]   I think you made an important point.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.960]   It's like, all right, you're applying to private colleges
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.400]   or whatever.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.240]   You think the bill will be 250.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.120]   Well, that's not due in freshman year.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.920]   You're paying that out over the course of four years,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.300]   four years from the fall of '25.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.740]   You're almost in 2030.
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.600]   It's possible Nvidia and Tesla could double again
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.440]   between now and then.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.320]   I don't know.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.520]   I didn't think they would in the first place.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.160]   So I don't know, but it seems to be like part of the,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   it seems to be like to me that if you have some stock market
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   exposure that you're taking off the table,
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   you don't have to take all of it off the table.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.440]   Also, if these are in taxable brokerage accounts,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.720]   these are huge embedded tax liabilities in the year
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.840]   that you take these gains in those two stocks.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.920]   So he said he's early Tesla.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.980]   I mean, I'm early Nvidia.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.560]   I own Nvidia from 2015.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.640]   I think I'm up 3,000%.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.320]   - Right, so maybe if he has other forms of liquidity,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.380]   tap those first.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.480]   - That's what I'm saying.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.640]   I think that's what I'm saying.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.480]   - That makes sense.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.640]   - So you're saying you think long treasuries
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.280]   would be too risky then for your risk tolerance?
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.520]   - What, long-term treasuries?
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   - Yeah.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.920]   - Well, if he wanted to, he could do a simple--
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.760]   - You said T-bills.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.580]   That's why I was asking.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.420]   - Oh, T-bills, yeah.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.240]   Not T-bonds.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.920]   He could do a ladder.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.760]   - Do a ladder.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.720]   - A five-year ladder or something, right?
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.560]   - Yeah.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.380]   - Something simple like that.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.940]   Do 20% in one, two, three, four, five-year maturities.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.240]   - Yeah, and you match those assets with the liabilities
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.340]   and it's done for.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.240]   - It's a lot of work, though.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.840]   You can find a target date fund.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.880]   You can find a, not a target date fund.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.000]   Don't they have the target maturity bond funds now?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.840]   - Yeah.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.660]   - They're pretty easy to use.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.500]   - Yeah, iShares has those.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.360]   It's pretty easy, yeah.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.340]   - I thought you were gonna say chart options.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.180]   - Yeah.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.680]   Well, I was gonna say, if you have a Lyft off account,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.520]   call us.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   We'll help you.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.800]   We know how to do this stuff.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.640]   - All right, next question.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.600]   - Thank you.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.440]   Okay.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.280]   - Hold on.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.360]   - Up next, we have a question from Matt.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.320]   - Wait, Nicole's moving my mic.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.160]   Okay.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.940]   - I appreciate Ben's long-term view
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.180]   of stock market correlations,
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.480]   I mean, of stock market corrections,
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.160]   but what if this time is different?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.360]   What are the stats when the Fed is actively offloading
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.960]   trillions of assets and raising rates?
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.800]   What if this cycle is an anomaly
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.400]   and should be treated as such?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.360]   - So I got this question from someone.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   John, do the chart on it.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.000]   I did just kind of a quick, over the last 70 plus years,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.400]   like, what's the distribution of drawdowns
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.240]   in the stock market?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.160]   Just saying, like, this is, we're down 10% right now.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   I think the average from all-time highs
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   at any point in time is like 9.5%.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.680]   So it's almost like the average experience
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.920]   in the stock market is you're looking up
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.860]   from a correction, basically.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.880]   All-time highs happen like seven or 8% of the time
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.080]   since 1950.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.920]   Most of the time you're in a drawdown.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.240]   20% or worse, it's like one out of every six or seven years.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   Since 1950, the S&P 500 has been 10%
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.660]   or further away from its high.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.500]   - Right.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.320]   - Is that worse?
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.520]   36% of the time?
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.360]   - Right.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.480]   - I didn't know that.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.600]   So a third of the time that you're investing,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.520]   you're investing in the midst of a correction.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.440]   - Yeah, and my point was, yeah, like, get used to it.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.920]   This is like no pain, no gain,
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.160]   no risk, reward, that whole thing.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.980]   But some people are saying, like,
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.120]   listen, throw all the historical evidence out the window
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.160]   because this time is totally different.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.280]   The Fed is raising rates
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.000]   and the government is spending trillions of dollars
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.600]   and the Fed is reducing its balance sheet
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.680]   and inflation is gonna be here to stay
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.160]   and all these things.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.040]   And I think the thing that we've come down on
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.640]   is that like every time it's different.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.560]   And every time there's a correction,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   you think this is the big one
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.440]   and the stock market is never coming back.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.480]   But you look back historically and you go,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.320]   well, if that little dip on the chart there
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.480]   back in 1950 or 1980 or whatever,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.600]   I would have totally bought that.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.780]   But when it's happening in real time,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.960]   you say, in the back of your head, you go,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.840]   but what if this is it?
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.760]   What if it doesn't come back this time?
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.360]   I think that happens every time.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.760]   - There's only one exception to what you're saying.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.360]   That's, Ben, that's true.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.900]   And if we were like having,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.560]   if there were YouTube or podcasts in the 1970s
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.400]   and we were having this conversation,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.640]   like, we could substitute all the stuff
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.160]   that the guy is saying.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.480]   Like, when was the last time this occurred
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.240]   with the Fed doing this?
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.400]   - Oil shocks and Nixon.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.120]   - Yeah, we could say, right,
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.600]   we could substitute the oil embargo
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.640]   and all this other stuff and Watergate.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.940]   So I agree, it's always different.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.540]   The one time that there's an exception,
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.920]   I think, is the pandemic.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.480]   Like, we had net positive flows
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   into our RIA in April and May of 2020.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.080]   Think about how crazy that is.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.280]   Because you had an unemployment print.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.000]   It was like the biggest drop in employment
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.680]   in history, one month drop.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.220]   Like, you had some superlatives where it's like,
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.560]   well, maybe this time it's not gonna bounce back
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.600]   because, right?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.020]   But, like, investors didn't give a shit.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.000]   We had net, I don't have the stats, I should ask Nick,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.600]   but we honestly raised so much money.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   It wasn't us, like, telling people,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.840]   hurry up, send us all your money,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.560]   the market's about to bounce.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   This was, like, unprompted clients.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.320]   Clients were just like, well,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.920]   if I were ever to put more money
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.280]   into my accounts with y'all, this would be the time.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.160]   And we were, like, pleasantly surprised.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.920]   They definitely didn't expect that.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.440]   So either people got smarter over the years
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.120]   since we've been doing this,
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.080]   or there was just something about
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.960]   that particular circumstance where this time,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   that time, they knew it was different,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.160]   but different for the right reasons.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.640]   And I think investors are more conditioned now.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   In the past, if you were in the '70s,
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.760]   you'd look back and you'd see, like, the Great Depression,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   and then you'd see, like, this huge bull market in the '50s,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.780]   but you didn't have as much time to look back and say,
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.640]   like, listen, every time the stock market goes down,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.320]   it comes back, right?
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.280]   There's never been a time where the stock market has fallen
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.920]   and it hasn't reached a new all-time high.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.240]   So this just happens, and I do think--
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   - I'm not smiling about it.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.400]   Nicole keeps backing my microphone away from me,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.000]   and I keep getting closer to it.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.840]   - Just eating it.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.160]   - Sorry, Nick, all right.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160]   But I think especially for young people,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.480]   they look at the state of the world and the scary headlines
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.440]   and think, like, it's never been this bad before.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.120]   I think William Bernstein had a quote
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.400]   that was something like,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.720]   "The only black swans of the history you haven't read yet."
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.320]   Like, history has always been terrible, unfortunately.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.360]   It's just the scary headlines are just beamed
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.320]   into our faces every single day now,
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.360]   and we can't get away from it.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.400]   - Right, we have more exposure to the news,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.260]   but also the news's profit motive has never been more,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.080]   so it's always, the profit motive of the news
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.680]   has always been to impulse people into doing something,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.920]   you know, put down a nickel, buy a newspaper,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.840]   or tune in at 6 p.m. for Cronkite.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.820]   That part has not changed.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.440]   It's just like everything else in the world,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.720]   it's on steroids.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.320]   And so the incentive system for people writing market news
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.940]   is to get you to read theirs and not someone else's.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.760]   And so once you understand, and I,
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.640]   you know, as I've talked about before,
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.000]   I eat, sleep, and breathe that world,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.640]   so I can tell you I'm not exaggerating.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.640]   Like, this is a much more challenging media environment
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.600]   for the average investor.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.880]   - Yeah, it's a firehose.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.920]   - It's way worse than anything
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.480]   that any other generation has experienced.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.720]   - Feels like mass media has become more and more like TMZ
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.120]   instead of TMZ becoming more and more like mass media.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.600]   - Listen, I've sat in meetings,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.640]   like where editors at major publications were like,
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.320]   yeah, but how can we like, how can we make this more,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.720]   they'll say like, how can we make this more urgent?
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.980]   Or how can we make this more interesting?
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.280]   So, you know, I know.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.120]   Like, I'm one of the people who knows.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.860]   - Like, we can't, we don't know how bad corrections
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.700]   in the future are going to be,
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.000]   or what the reasoning's going to be,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.420]   or when the stock market is gonna have a period
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.880]   of crappy returns.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.040]   Like, that stuff is all gonna happen,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.640]   but I don't think, that doesn't mean you abandon risk assets
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.960]   because they're gonna make you feel uncomfortable
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.800]   from time to time.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.040]   Like, this is totally normal, the feeling of discomfort.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.840]   That happens to every investor.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.840]   - So it's a button up.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.800]   What he's asking is perfectly legitimate.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.840]   He's like, look, I get it.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.480]   You have this data back to 1950,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.080]   and you're showing us, you know,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.360]   how often stocks are in a 10% drawdown
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.040]   and how often they're at highs.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.200]   But what's not in your data set
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.120]   is the unique set of circumstances
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.640]   that we're living through now,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.040]   including, you know, a record-setting pace of rate hikes
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.720]   and, you know, the Fed shrinking its balance sheet
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.840]   and government deficit.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.640]   Yes, you're correct.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.780]   This particular mix of circumstances does not show up
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.960]   in a data set going back to 1950.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.560]   But can I show you Vietnam?
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.380]   Can I show you presidential assassinations?
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.400]   Multiple?
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.900]   Like, you know, I'll show you some other stuff
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.760]   that's not going on right now, you know?
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.120]   So I think that's a good point.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.080]   - Let's not beat a dead horse.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.040]   What else we got?
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.520]   - Yep, next one.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.400]   - All right, up next, we have a question from Joe.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.880]   A question I've asked my friends
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.360]   and would love to hear you guys discuss in detail
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.040]   is what makes the tech giants of today
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.240]   any different from Cisco, Intel, or Microsoft
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.840]   after the dot-com bust?
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.600]   Could these stocks end up going nowhere over the next decade?
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.640]   Why are the tech stocks of today any different?
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.240]   So kind of on the same theme.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.000]   - It's funny that Microsoft is one of the big tech stocks
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.520]   today, and it was, John, throw up the chart here.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.840]   I did Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.760]   going back from the 1999 peak, early 2000 peak.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.160]   Microsoft is actually the only one that's come back.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.760]   Cisco and Intel are still underwater from back then,
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.800]   and Microsoft was underwater for 16 years, I think,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   so it was 2016 on a price basis that it took to round trip.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.240]   I'm not sure many people realize this.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.200]   The NASDAQ 100 was underwater from 2000 to 2016 as well
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.720]   after going through an 83% drought.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.180]   So as great as the NASDAQ 100 has done
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.180]   in the past decade and a half,
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.980]   it went nowhere for over a decade and a half.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.040]   It's interesting.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.400]   So from 2009, the NASDAQ 100 was up 19.2% per year,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.480]   which is just impossible for any professional investor
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.320]   to beat.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.360]   Since the start of 2000, it's only up 6.5% per year,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.480]   'cause from 2000 to 2008, the NASDAQ 100 was down 12%
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.520]   per year for almost a decade.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.820]   So, I mean, that was the craziest the US stock market
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.140]   has ever gotten, but I guess the way I look at it
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.300]   is the biggest difference between now and then
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.620]   is these companies are like conglomerates now, right?
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.660]   Like Microsoft, how many different business lines
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.500]   do they have?
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.700]   How many different business lines does Amazon have?
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.660]   - But the good kind, not GE, right?
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.300]   - Yeah, back then, I don't think these companies
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.120]   were as bulletproof.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.720]   Now, that doesn't mean these companies can't underperform,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.220]   but to have that sort of level of underperformance,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.260]   I think things got so silly in the dot-com bubble
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.860]   that this is a different story.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.580]   - So, there's a few things what separates this from 2000,
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.540]   in my mind, today's tech companies versus,
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.800]   first of all, the NASDAQ was like 86 times earnings
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   back then, and one of the things skewing that number higher,
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.580]   the P/E ratio, is that a lot of the companies
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.340]   were just not profitable.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.780]   So, the largest dot-com IPOs,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.820]   not only were they not profitable, they had no revenue.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.500]   Like, we're talking about companies coming public--
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.980]   - Yeah, there were no fundamentals back then.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.100]   - No fundamentals.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.620]   So, that's a really, really big difference.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.900]   You look at the 100 companies that make up the queues
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.340]   right now, compared to the dot-com bubble darlings,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.300]   there's no comparison on a fundamental basis.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.180]   Back then, these were companies doing experimental things
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.820]   with literally no business model.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.260]   That is not what people are investing in right now.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.700]   So, that's an important distinction.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.900]   Valuations are not cheap now, but they don't look like that.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.700]   So, like, Apple is now 24 times next year's earnings,
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.020]   they're expected to grow earnings by 8%.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.300]   Next year, let's assume consensus is somewhat close.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.020]   It's not cheap on its earnings growth,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   but it's got features that investors are probably prizing
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.900]   just as highly as earnings growth.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.800]   It's got more stability than most countries in the world.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.300]   They can issue debt at a AAA rating.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.020]   It's got a forever fortress balance sheet.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.460]   I think they have $144 billion in cash.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.420]   They're earning more money on their cash
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.580]   than some S&P 500 companies are earning
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.780]   in operating income, okay?
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.600]   So, and to Ben's point, it would be foolish
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.040]   to compare Cisco, which did one thing in the year 2000,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.660]   they did networking, like, literally,
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.220]   that was the business, to an Amazon,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.500]   which is the number one or number two player
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.900]   in 10 different businesses.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.620]   >> Right, I went to Whole Foods today,
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.540]   which is owned by Amazon,
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.260]   and I paid for my Whole Foods salad or something,
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.580]   credit to me for eating healthy, with my palm.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.000]   I paid with the palm of my hand.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.280]   I go on IMDB on my phone,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.700]   'cause I like looking up people who are in movies.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.220]   That's owned by Amazon, they own MGM, Prime Video,
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.340]   they have the cloud business.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.900]   They buy up all their competitors these days,
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.340]   so these companies are more than just one business line.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.700]   There's so much more diversified.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.140]   Again, that doesn't mean they can't underperform,
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.980]   but not like that. >> Doesn't mean the stocks
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.460]   can't go down or sit flat.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.860]   Actually, one of the funny things about Microsoft,
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.060]   now that you mention it,
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.180]   you know, Ballmer kind of got a raw deal.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.780]   First of all, he's the only,
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.100]   he's the only, like, mega-billionaire
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.260]   who made his money as an employee, not a founder.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.500]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.700]   He didn't start, you know, he was employee number 30.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.540]   >> Right, he was like Bill Gates' assistant or something.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.620]   >> Microsoft hired him to follow Bill Gates around
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.620]   and probably make sure he didn't put on two different shoes.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.300]   But he worked his way up within the company,
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.340]   and when Gates was tired, Ballmer said, "Put me in, coach."
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.420]   And over that next 10-year period, while he was the CEO,
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.820]   I think Microsoft tripled their earnings.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.820]   Problem is the stock didn't go up,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.220]   because starting valuations matter.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.620]   >> Right, it was so high.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.460]   >> I think it was 60 times earnings,
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.500]   and then by the end of that decade,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.780]   it's like 15 times earnings.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.500]   And part of that is multiple compression,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.620]   the stock going down or nowhere,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.140]   and part of that is earnings growth,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.940]   but they're not getting credit for that earnings growth,
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.780]   because it was not a bull market for tech,
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.700]   and Ballmer stepped into the seat at a very high valuation.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.980]   >> Yeah, you also had two 50% stock market crashes,
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.140]   and so that didn't happen.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.020]   >> So it's very possible that NVIDIA grows its earnings
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.420]   by 20% a year for the next 10 years,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.140]   and the stock doesn't do much.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.100]   That's the risk, what do you want?
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.380]   You want guarantees?
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.860]   We're all taking risks.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.220]   Choose the risk that you want to take.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.740]   >> Just for some context and perspective,
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.860]   how did that era compare to the SPAC era
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860]   that we just experienced,
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   and that young people might have just experienced
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.700]   for the first time?
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.860]   >> No, there's no-- >> Crazier, right?
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.780]   >> You're talking about like,
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.860]   you're comparing an acoustic guitar to an octopus on,
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.460]   you know, like there's no,
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.780]   it's not even apples and oranges,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.820]   two different conversations.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.260]   >> The dot-com bubble was like four or five years
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.420]   of that behavior, not just like a six-month period.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.260]   Also, the other thing--
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.940]   >> No, the SPAC boom was a freak show.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.700]   It was not even like,
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.380]   the thing about the dot-com bubble,
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.300]   and this point has been made more eloquently
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.740]   by people like Marc Andreessen,
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.820]   like all of the ideas were good.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.380]   It was just too early.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.660]   The world wasn't ready for them,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.020]   but like, we had Webvan and Peapod,
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.660]   and these were early delivery grocery internet sites.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.060]   It was just, it was too early.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:35.900]   >> Yeah, it wasn't ready for that.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.820]   >> The world wasn't ready.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.980]   Pets.com was a bad idea.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.260]   20 years later, we have Chewy, great idea.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.300]   So it's not,
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.740]   you can't compare that to SPAC mania,
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.380]   which is just fundamentally bad ideas.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.420]   It was people coming public,
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.480]   oh, we're going to build a submarine with a screen door.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.860]   Oh, you are?
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.000]   Here's our six billion dollars.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.860]   You know, like, forget that.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.500]   We're not talking about that.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.340]   >> Also, the--
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.900]   >> We're going to build a solar power flashlight company.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.740]   You want in?
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.780]   My nephew started it this morning.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.720]   We're worth 900 million dollars.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.560]   You want in?
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.720]   Yes, I want in, said the pension fund manager.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.560]   >> These questions, though,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.500]   that are just uncomfortable investing in stocks,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.640]   this is the reason that stocks have the highest return
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.380]   over the long term, because the future is unknown,
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.500]   and you really just don't know.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.880]   Like, the people that don't give it the benefit of the doubt
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.120]   or are worried all the time,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.660]   this is why stocks give you good returns,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660]   'cause they are risky.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.440]   That's the--
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.420]   >> Well said.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.860]   >> All right, next question.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.600]   >> Okay, up next we have a question from Jim.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.140]   I'm having an asset allocation dilemma.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.420]   In my late 50s,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.720]   in my late 50s, doing well financially, not to brag,
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.180]   rapidly approaching retirement,
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.300]   and bonds have finally,
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.300]   finally have some yield after 15 years of 0% rates.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.260]   I know I should be de-risking my portfolio,
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.060]   and now is a great time to do it,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.100]   but I also know my wife and I
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.820]   have probably 20 to 30 more years to grow our wealth
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.100]   and keep up with inflation once we retire at 65.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.300]   I would love to hear your thoughts
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.920]   on how to think about this transition phase
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.700]   in one's investing life cycle,
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.900]   since there's no handbook for this kind of thing.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.740]   >> Good question.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.580]   This is the time when your financial plan matters most,
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.580]   'cause when you're young,
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.420]   the thing that matters most
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.940]   is saving and personal finance.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.500]   Middle age, investing probably takes over a little bit,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.420]   and you wanna compound it
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.140]   and make sure you're investing the right way.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.140]   But as you approach retirement,
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.260]   that's when you lean on the financial plan
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.080]   and get financial planning advice,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.000]   'cause that's when you wanna match up
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.500]   what you're actually gonna do with this money
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.300]   with how you invest it and what your goals are.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.280]   So I think that's probably the most important stage of life
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.860]   to have these conversations, right?
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.780]   Is because, you don't know,
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.700]   'cause that's the thing people have been talking to us
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.480]   for a decade now, is how do I balance out,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.380]   I know I need to keep growing my money
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.940]   over two, three, maybe four decades when I'm retired,
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.780]   but I also have to have it be safe when I want to spend it.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.520]   And that balance is really difficult
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.800]   for people to figure out.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.060]   - Yeah, I wish we could really answer this question
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.000]   in this forum, but there are so many other variables
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.440]   that a certified financial planner would have to know
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.960]   in order to really satisfactorily tell you
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.540]   this percent in this, that percent in that.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.200]   What a certified financial planner is doing
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.740]   in the early stages of talking to a prospective client
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.280]   is trying to figure out, not what should I invest in,
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.980]   it's when is the money gonna be used?
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.920]   And which money should be accessed at what time
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.580]   from which account?
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.460]   Until you do that work and come up with,
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.740]   all right, this bucket of money we know we need for blank,
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.140]   and this is roughly the date.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.260]   Now, you don't have to know the answers,
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.520]   but you have to set some parameters,
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.180]   and I think that that's a financial planning question,
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.540]   and we would have to know a lot more info.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.460]   - Yeah, you have to like, you invert it.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.180]   You're like, this is how much I'm gonna spend,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.020]   this is when I'm gonna spend it.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.860]   - Yeah, you have to work backwards.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.700]   - Yeah, now how do I invest it?
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.900]   And that's the thing that most people
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.020]   don't have to think about when they're accumulating wealth.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.500]   It's like the deaccumulation phase.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.260]   - I mean, this is what we do for a living,
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.020]   and not to start marketing,
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.820]   but this person is a great candidate
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.380]   for building a financial plan
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.500]   with somebody that knows what they're doing.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.660]   - That's the age we tend to get clients at,
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.140]   and a lot of times it's like,
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.060]   maybe something complex happens in their life,
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:38.900]   they get stock options,
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.340]   but a lot of times it's someone who's,
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.820]   listen, I've built the wealth myself,
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   I've done fine doing it that way,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.780]   now I need some help and I have to talk to an advisor
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.140]   to figure out the next steps.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.740]   - Yeah, I also think people like confirmation,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.140]   or they like having somebody to bounce things off of,
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.980]   and most people don't have someone in their life
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.700]   that understands taxes, insurance,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.620]   like long-term retirement and different account types,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.020]   and it's just--
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.180]   - Yes, if you text most of your normal friends,
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.860]   "I have an asset allocation dilemma,"
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.700]   they're probably not,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.740]   you're probably not gonna get a good answer.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.180]   - They're like doing fantasy football
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.020]   while they're talking to you.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.860]   They have no idea.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.500]   All right, we got anything else?
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.340]   - Yeah. - We got one more.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.420]   - Yeah, last but not least,
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.980]   we have a question from Andrew.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.500]   - I like this question.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.660]   - These questions are all 700 words long.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.260]   These are like blog posts.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.660]   - You should see them before I edit them.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.180]   - Yes, we actually scrub them a little bit.
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.860]   I shorten them and Duncan shortens them again.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.500]   - I mean, they're great.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.860]   I don't, no disrespect, they're great questions.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.940]   - People give us a lot of information.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.860]   - Do it, do it.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.620]   - Okay, I have two young kids
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.500]   and we're starting to discuss giving the older one,
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.180]   age five, an allowance.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.180]   We have an idea of the amount, $5 a week,
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.860]   and an idea of how to teach them to budget
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.140]   using the three jar method, saving, spending, giving.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.220]   However, we can't agree about whether or not
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.980]   to tie this to chores, the arguments being,
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.980]   one, money in the real world is tied to work,
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.900]   so he should learn that lesson.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.660]   Number two, budgeting, spending, and savings
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.420]   are unique skillset that should be learned
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.580]   separately from chores, which should be done
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.020]   out of a sense of familial, it's a hard word,
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.620]   responsibility, not for a reward.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.500]   I was wondering if you give your kids an allowance
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.900]   and which approach you take.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.180]   - Five seems young to me.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.780]   So my twins are six, and like--
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.740]   - I was gonna say, this is not gonna stick.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.300]   - So a couple months ago, my six-year-old daughter, Kate,
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.740]   said, out of nowhere, she just goes,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.780]   "Thank you for giving us such a nice house to live in."
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.740]   And I was like, "Oh, that's very kind of you."
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.620]   And she said, "It must be really expensive to buy a house."
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.940]   I said, "Yes, how much do you think it costs?"
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.620]   She said, "I don't know, $19?"
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.460]   Yeah, close.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.300]   - Close.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.740]   - Yeah, so I like the bucketing approach.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.060]   Yeah, I like the bucketing approach.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.340]   That's like the Ron Lieber strategy
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.180]   from "Opposite of Spoiled."
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.020]   So they're obviously, they've done some research on this.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.220]   Josh, you have kids that are older than me.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.780]   'Cause I've heard both of these.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.060]   Some people say the allowance has to be tied to work
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.860]   to show that you get some sort of output
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.540]   for doing hard work, and some people say,
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.060]   "No, no, no, the chores are part of being in a family.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.260]   "The allowance is a different thing
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.540]   "to help teach about money."
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.380]   Does it really matter?
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.100]   - I don't think anything that you really teach your kids
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.620]   under the age of 12 is gonna stick.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.300]   Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.200]   I think you just give them stuff when they're,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.040]   let them be kids.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.620]   They have their whole fucking lives to worry about,
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.240]   budgeting and all this horrible stuff.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.420]   Just let them be kids.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.340]   And then what's gonna happen
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.460]   is they're gonna start wanting things.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.780]   Like not silly things from toy stores
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.300]   or like an app on their phone,
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.780]   but they're gonna want stuff.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.620]   So for my daughter, it's makeup and clothes and jewelry,
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.980]   very traditional, exactly what you'd expect.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.940]   And so she babysits.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.020]   And it's funny, like she asks for something
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.000]   and then my wife will buy it and she'll be like,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.780]   "All right, I'm gonna contribute my babysitting money."
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.400]   My wife will look at her like,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.980]   "How many hours of babysitting
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.080]   "do you really think you did?
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.140]   "Like your contribution is not really going that far yet."
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.380]   But it's the point, like to the question,
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.580]   to answer the question, it is good.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.780]   It's good for her to feel like she's making a contribution,
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.780]   even though we're buying her like a bag
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.900]   that's like very expensive, you know.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.240]   It's good for her to give up, have skin in the game.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.460]   So I agree with that.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.980]   My son doesn't work, he's a bookie.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.780]   He's in five fantasy football leagues.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.580]   He wins two or three of them every season,
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.260]   including the one at Red Holt's Wealth.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.940]   And they're not letting him win.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.300]   He's just a very talented gambler.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.900]   And then he grabs my phone
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.420]   and he created a Caesars profile for himself.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.740]   And he's doing in-game betting
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.500]   while I'm downstairs in the kitchen making a sandwich.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.540]   And I don't, he has a jar full of cash
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.820]   and I don't even understand where he's getting it from.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.180]   You know, I'm probably gonna find out
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.300]   he's selling Oxy in ninth grade.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.860]   I have no idea what's going on.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.260]   He's really good with money though,
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.080]   'cause he doesn't want anything.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.420]   Like he spends money once a year.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.580]   He wants like to put money toward going to a Knicks game.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.380]   Like that's, and he literally,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.060]   he'll be like, "Here's $300."
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.580]   Dude, I didn't see $300 until I was like 22.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.300]   - See that's my-- - I don't know.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.780]   - My nine-year-old is a saver. - He's very good with money.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.340]   He does not sell anything.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.660]   - My daughter, if she gets money for a birthday
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.620]   or Christmas or Easter or whatever,
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.720]   she stocks it away in her thing and she's a saver.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.740]   That's kind of how I was when I was young too.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.180]   And when we forget to get money
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.780]   for the cleaning person that comes every two weeks--
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.260]   - Yeah, take the right out of the jar.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.020]   So, oh, so I forgot what I was trying to say.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.940]   So let me finish this.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.220]   So what's interesting is that
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.680]   I don't think I can tie chores to money for him.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.980]   Like for her, the babysitting,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.300]   and she'll complain, "Oh, I have no money.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.100]   "All my friends are doing this thing."
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.420]   It's like, all right, well, for the last two weeks in a row,
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.780]   you got an invite to babysit and you said no.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.380]   And then by the way, the parents in my town,
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.820]   they're paying like, I think they're paying like $20 an hour.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.740]   So you sit in someone's house for 80 bucks
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.180]   on a Friday night, like, do it.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.980]   My son, he'll be like, that's not--
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.860]   - That's where the inflation has doubled
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.460]   in the last five years.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.580]   - So I'm like, I'll give you $5.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.840]   Take out the garbage this week.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.540]   I'm like, I'm gonna do it with $5, Dad.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.180]   So it's interesting, it's like two very...
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.080]   And so we taught them, I think,
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.660]   the same values and whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.140]   But people are gonna be people.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.800]   So I don't think you should torture your kids
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.340]   with chores to teach them the value of a dollar.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.900]   I don't think it's gonna go anywhere.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.180]   - Also, you do run the risk of becoming the parents
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.540]   that all the other kids are afraid of
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.820]   because you're like really strict
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.380]   and you give your kids a list of chores
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.380]   they have to do every week.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.140]   And there's always that kid.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.420]   You don't wanna like be that.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.700]   - Hold on, it's Tom Whalen, delete that comment.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.740]   That's wild, don't tweet stuff like that.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.700]   All right, not that one, the other one.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.060]   So what was I gonna say?
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.460]   Oh, so yeah, I think, look,
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.980]   I think kids are gonna learn, unfortunately,
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.780]   they're gonna learn about money the hard way.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.580]   Like they're gonna do stupid stuff with money
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.860]   that either they get for their birthday or that they earn.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.340]   Like that's just the nature of life.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.940]   - Yeah, they're not gonna learn much yet.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.220]   - They're not gonna learn much.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.060]   - My daughter at nine has been asking me,
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.060]   kind of trying to figure out what I do for a living.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.060]   She's most impressed with the fact that we're on YouTube.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.300]   But she, trying to explain what the concept
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.860]   of money and investing to a young person
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.900]   is nearly impossible.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.140]   Well, you have this money, then you make it grow bigger,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.420]   but it's a concept that is so foreign
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.060]   that it's just, their eyes gloss over and they're done.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.660]   - You know what it's like,
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.620]   I don't wanna go down this road too far
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.820]   because we know like 100 people in real life
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.220]   that are gonna get really upset about this,
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.300]   but like, I kind of laugh to myself
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.660]   when I see people doing like financial literacy
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.620]   for 18-year-olds, like about retirement investing.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.300]   - What are you talking about?
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.780]   - Yeah, you have to wait till it actually matters.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.020]   - Nobody should be investing for retirement in their 20s.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.700]   - How about just exploring student loans first?
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.100]   Right, yeah, you have to wait till it's actually applicable.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.140]   - How about just go be 24 years old and don't save anything?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.140]   It's like the only, Ben, I know that's anathema
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:21.980]   from where you're coming from,
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.580]   but like just my personal opinion is the only time
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.580]   in your life you're ever gonna be 24.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.420]   What are you worried about retirement?
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.340]   - Yeah, you have no responsibilities, I agree.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.420]   - You could be dead next year, what are you doing, you know?
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.580]   - Enjoy yourself, yes.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.300]   - You have no dependence.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.100]   This theoretical retirement you're putting money away for,
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.420]   like I gotta save money for my future children's college?
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.780]   No, you don't, you have to go to Mexico.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.580]   That's what you have to do.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.100]   So I know that's like, you know,
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.620]   not like a Fintwit approved take, but that's the truth.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.500]   - I agree, all right.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.860]   Thank you to Josh Brown for making it.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.020]   We have to go now 'cause you have to go
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.540]   record "The Compound" in France probably.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.620]   - Yeah, like very soon.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.900]   - You guys kill it every week.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.500]   Thanks so much for doing the show
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.340]   and I know the listeners love it.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.060]   And thanks for having me.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.780]   - Yeah, thanks everyone for coming on live.
