[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   Here's an email from a podcast listener named Luke who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.600]   "Pastor John, how do we reconcile Ezekiel 18.32, 'For I have no pleasure in the death
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.740]   of anyone,' declares the Lord God, with Deuteronomy 28.63, 'And as the Lord took delight in doing
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.280]   you good and multiplying you, so the Lord will take delight in bringing ruin upon you
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.080]   and destroying you.'
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.040]   How do you handle this apparent contradiction in Scripture between Ezekiel 18.32 and Deuteronomy
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   28.63?"
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.600]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.280]   When I meet passages like this in the Bible, especially passages relating to the emotions
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:59.960]   of God, I am very slow to think that God cannot have these seemingly contradictory emotions.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.320]   One expressed in Ezekiel 18.32, "I do not have pleasure in the death of anyone," and
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.120]   the other expressed in Deuteronomy 28.63, "The Lord will take delight in bringing ruin
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.440]   upon you and destroying you."
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.160]   Instead, my assumption is that there is a true way that God takes pleasure in the just
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.280]   destruction of the wicked, and there is a true sense in which He does not delight in
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.920]   the death of anyone.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.920]   In other words, both are true, and our job is to discern as much as we can in what different
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.480]   ways or senses they may be true.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.400]   It may be, Tony, that since this is such a huge issue, I should point to a couple of
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.120]   places where I've written about it.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:59.600]   Desiring God, pages 38 to 40, and The Pleasures of God, pages 55 to 59, I tackle precisely
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.360]   those two texts that were mentioned.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.160]   It's as if they were reading what I wrote and wanted some clarity on it.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.320]   That's where I've written about it if you want to pull down the book off the shelf.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.640]   But let me try to give a brief answer here, not depend on people going there.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.520]   God's emotional life must be infinitely complex.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.800]   Who can comprehend that the Lord hears in one moment of time the prayers, for example,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.400]   of 10 million Christians around the world and sympathizes with each one personally and
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.120]   individually as a caring Father, as Hebrews 4.15 says He does, even though among these
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.280]   10 million prayers, some are brokenhearted and some are bursting with joy?
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.200]   How can God weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice when they are both
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.960]   coming to Him at the same time?
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.680]   In fact, they're always coming to Him with no break at all, day in and day out, century
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.780]   after century.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.120]   This is unfathomable for us how God in His infinite complexity of emotions can relate
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.940]   intimately, personally, in a present wonderful way to the brokenhearted and not be a spoiled
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.740]   sport at somebody's wedding at the same time while He's delighting in the joy that they
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.420]   are having.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.700]   So consider, maybe this would help.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.820]   It helped me anyway.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.620]   The most relevant analogy I could think of was whether or not God delighted in the death
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.500]   of Jesus.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.660]   Now clearly, God chose that His Son would be killed.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.780]   Isaiah 53.10, "It was the will of the Lord to crush Him or bruise Him.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.220]   He has put Him to grief."
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.380]   What's not clear is that the word "will," the Hebrew word "will," "hafeitz," is translated
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:11.500]   most often with delight or take pleasure or enjoy or be glad or be the good pleasure of.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.220]   In other words, nobody twisted God's arm to send His Son to die.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.780]   The death of the Son of God in one sense pleased God.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.780]   It was a good and right and hard thing to do.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.980]   In fact, Ephesians 5.2 says that Christ gave Himself, quote, "as a fragrant offering and
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.660]   sacrifice to God."
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.580]   You want to stop and say, "Fragrant offering?"
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.220]   Like to whom was it such a good smell?
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.300]   And the answer is God.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:59.020]   And yet Romans 8.32 says, "God did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all."
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.900]   Now that word "did not spare" is intended to communicate to us that this was not easy.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.620]   This was His only Son.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.020]   This was His much-loved Son.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.380]   This was emotionally difficult in one sense for God to do.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.020]   He loved His Son.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.380]   He did not relish the thought of the pain that would come to His Son, the darkness that
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.140]   would spread over His Son.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.340]   And yet, in another sense, He did.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.580]   So another analogy that has helped me with that and the other passages from Ezekiel and
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:45.620]   Deuteronomy is to suggest that God's infinite complexity is such that He can look at the
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.940]   world through two lenses.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.660]   He can look through a narrow lens or a wide-angle lens.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.740]   And when God looks at a painful or wicked event through a narrow lens, He sees the tragedy
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:07.380]   of sin for what it is in itself, and He's angered or He's grieved at what He sees.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.100]   I have no pleasure in the death of anyone when God looks at a painful or wicked event
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.220]   through His narrow lens.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.900]   But when He looks through His wide-angle lens, He sees the tragedy of sin in relation to
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.180]   everything leading up to it and everything flowing from it.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.060]   He sees it in relation to all the connections and all the effects that form a pattern or
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.500]   a mosaic stretching into eternity.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.460]   And that mosaic in all of its parts, good and evil, bring Him delight.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.220]   Psalm 135.6, whatever the Lord pleases, He does.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.860]   He's pleased by all that He does and all that He permits in the world.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.820]   He has His reasons for doing it in the wide-angle lens of things.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.540]   So that's my effort to stay faithful to the Scriptures and come to terms with the
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.220]   infinitely complex emotional life of God.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.120]   Through one lens, He does not delight in the death of anyone, and through another lens,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.840]   as He sees it as part of the whole, He does.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   That is brilliant balance.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.620]   Thank you, Pastor John, for tackling these important issues.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.840]   And Luke, thank you for the question.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.540]   Every weekday we answer questions like this, and we are now over 700 episodes in.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.340]   That is a lot of grace.

[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.420]   We have a guest joining us on Monday and Tuesday of next week, because I want to know, how
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:52.620]   is it that non-Christian novelists who suppress the truth in unrighteousness also know so
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.220]   much about the human condition?
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.200]   This is a doozy of a question, and we will call on theologian John Frame to step in and
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   help us out.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   I can't wait.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.600]   That's Monday and Tuesday of next week.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.880]   Have a great weekend, and we will see you here on Monday.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   Thank you.
