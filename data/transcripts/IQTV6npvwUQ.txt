[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.220]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.720]   with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.480]   Today we have a question from a listener named Chase.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.000]   Hello Pastor John, and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.700]   According to Arthur C. Brooks,
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.160]   the president of a public policy think tank
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.440]   in Washington, D.C.,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.360]   88% of our happiness is determined by two factors.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.200]   Events that occurred in our recent past, 40%,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.220]   and genetics, 48%.
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.600]   That leaves around 12% left to our day-by-day control,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.120]   which can be used to pursue four basic things.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.840]   Faith, family, community, and work.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.580]   The four surest ways to happiness, he says.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.640]   I'm curious how the idea of Christian hedonism
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.460]   either compliments or contradicts
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.420]   this research on happiness,
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.040]   the statistical breakdown, and where happiness
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.920]   is found to begin with.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.160]   - Two comments.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.920]   First, a comment about the notion that 88%
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.400]   of our happiness is determined,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   and 12% is left to our day-by-day control.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560]   Christians don't think that way.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.120]   And I'm leaving aside the whole issue
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.840]   that God controls it all.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.120]   Not just our past, but the 100%.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.080]   I'm not even talking about that.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.360]   The reason we don't think that way
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.140]   is that the last 12% of freedom that we have to adjust,
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.520]   if that were true,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.240]   the Christian says, "With this 12%,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.320]   "or with the tiny fraction of this 12%,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.020]   "I can embrace the gospel of Jesus,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.640]   "which has three stunning effects
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.400]   "regarding that 88% of my past
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   "that you say is unchangeably determining of my happiness."
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.980]   Here are the three effects.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.040]   Number one, through the gospel of Jesus,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.120]   all my past sins are forgiven,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.240]   and suddenly the whole load of guilt
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   that was crushing me from that 88% past is gone.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   Number two, through the gospel of Jesus,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   we are not only forgiven, but made forgiving,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   which means that the whole load of bitterness and anger
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.400]   that made our whole life toxic
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   and caused us to seethe about our past is taken away.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.480]   Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   So we lay it down,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   and the crushing weight of past wrongs against us is lifted.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   And so that 88% is dramatically changed.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.480]   And number three, through the gospel of Jesus,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.760]   we are given the Holy Spirit
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   who begins to transform our hearts and minds,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.640]   which the public policy polls said
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   were determined by the past.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   In other words, these kinds of statistics
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   and polls and predictions are naturalistic, God-less.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.520]   They don't reckon with the supernatural.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.280]   They don't reckon with God or Jesus
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.200]   or the massive effects of the death
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.160]   and resurrection of Christ
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.480]   or the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.400]   So that's my first comment.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   The other one is that Brooke's second claim could be true
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.080]   if he were speaking and thinking in a Christian way,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.680]   with Christian categories, not just a naturalistic one.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.040]   Here's what he says.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.760]   He says, "Choosing to pursue four basic things,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   faith, family, community, and work,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.360]   is the surest way to happiness."
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.520]   Hmm.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   So here's the Christian content
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   that would make that statement true.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.200]   One, pursuing faith means,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.240]   yes, that would get you happiness
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.840]   if faith means being satisfied
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.280]   in all that God is for us in Christ.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.840]   If that's what he means by pursuing faith,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.400]   that would do it.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.360]   Number two, he says,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.240]   "Pursuing family is the path to happiness."
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.240]   I say, yes, if he means with a happy submission
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.000]   to God's will as to whether we will ever have a family
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.140]   beyond our parents, whether we'll ever be married,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.120]   whether we'll ever have kids.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   And if he means pursuing the family we do have
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.440]   with conviction that there is a special joy to be found
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.460]   in seeking our joy in the joy
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.620]   of those God has put in our family.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.720]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.840]   That is the path to happiness.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.560]   But if we put our hope for happiness
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.140]   in the family we hope we'll be,
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.660]   that's almost a sure path to disillusionment.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.280]   Number three, pursuing community is the path to happiness.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.860]   Well, yes, if pursuing community means
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.780]   getting outside ourselves and for the glory of God
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.700]   in reliance upon the grace of God,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.180]   discovering in community it is more blessed
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.380]   to give than to receive.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   And fourth, he says pursuing work is the path to happiness.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.480]   And I say, yes, if we realize that according to Genesis 1,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   God made us in his image and sent us out
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.720]   to display his glory by being sub creators
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.400]   and sub managers as we work the world.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.980]   And if we realize that according to Ephesians 2.10,
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.980]   Jesus saved us by grace and created us for good works,
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.060]   that is to do good in our vocation and in every other way
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.140]   as a fruit and overflow of our newness in Christ.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.940]   So if Brooks were willing to modify
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.980]   his statistical determinism
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.100]   and his fourfold path to happiness in these ways,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.460]   I would give three cheers.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.460]   Amen.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.340]   Thank you for addressing this story, Pastor John.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.740]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.980]   a part of your day and commute.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.420]   It's an honor to tag along with you as part of your day.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.860]   And three times a week we publish
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.500]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.420]   and search our past episodes in our archive.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.500]   Even reach us by email with a question you may be facing
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.360]   about how we find joy.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.240]   Like this very good question today.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.580]   You can do all that through our online home
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.480]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.580]   Well, is God a megalomaniac?
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.300]   Someone consumed with his own power?
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.460]   It's a question we get a lot.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.900]   And this time it comes from a 15 year old
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.020]   who is wrestling with this very question.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.980]   He struggles and he thinks that God's expectation
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.260]   that we find our greatest happiness in worshiping him
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.260]   to be coercive and mean, manipulative, and even wrong.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.380]   So how does John Piper respond?
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.260]   We'll find out when we return on Wednesday, Lord willing.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.100]   I am your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.260]   (upbeat music)
