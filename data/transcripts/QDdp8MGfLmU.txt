[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   There's a number of different hormones associated with the different stages of sleep.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.040]   We know that melatonin is a hormone of nighttime that makes us sleepy.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.440]   What about growth hormone release?
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.920]   When does that occur during sleep?
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.480]   So growth hormone release happens all day long and all night long.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.800]   But the deep slow-wave sleep that you get, the very first sleep cycle is when you get
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.520]   a big bolus of growth hormone release.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.360]   And in men and women equally.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.000]   And if you miss that first deep slow-wave sleep period, you also miss that big bolus
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.880]   of growth hormone release.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.440]   And you might get ultimately across the day just as much overall growth hormone release.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.080]   But endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses do different things than a little
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.720]   bit eked out over time.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.160]   So that is when we know there's also a big push to synthesize proteins.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.480]   So that's when the protein synthesis part that builds memories, for example, in our
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.320]   brain happens in that first cycle of sleep.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.000]   So you don't want to miss that, especially if you've learned something really big and
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.580]   needs more synaptic space to encode it.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.800]   How would somebody miss that first 90 minutes?
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   Sleep-depriving themselves.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   So let's say I normally go to sleep at 10 p.m.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.960]   And then from 10 to 11.30 would be this first phase of sleep.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.720]   And that's when the big bolus of growth hormone would be released.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.360]   Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead at 11.30 or midnight, that I miss that first
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   phase of sleep?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.080]   Why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep just simply starting later?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.120]   It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body that knows when things should happen.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.800]   And every cell in our body has a clock.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.120]   And all of those clocks are normally synchronized.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.160]   And the circadian clocks are synchronized.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.440]   And so our cells are ready to respond to that growth hormone release at a particular time.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.800]   And if we miss it-- and it's a time in relation to melatonin also.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.600]   So if you miss it, yeah, you might get some growth hormone release.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.120]   But it's occurring at a time when your clock has already moved to the next phase.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.800]   And so it's just a clock thing.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.840]   I don't think we can overstate the importance of what you just described.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.200]   And to be honest, despite knowing a bit about the sleep research and circadian biology,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.840]   this is the very first time that I've ever heard this, that if you normally go to sleep
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.560]   at a particular time and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep, that
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.200]   you can't simply initiate your sleep bout later and expect to capture that first phase
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   of sleep.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.680]   So this is incredible and, I think, important and, as many listeners are probably realizing,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.800]   also highly actionable.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.240]   So what this means is that we should have fairly consistent bedtimes in addition to
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.800]   fairly consistent wake times.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   Is that right?
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Yes.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.840]   And in fact, one of the best markers of good neurological health when we get older is consistent
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.400]   bedtimes.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.920]   Wow.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.200]   OK.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.640]   I don't want to backtrack, but I did write down something that I think is important for
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.660]   me to resolve or for you to resolve.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.240]   So I'm going to ask this.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.520]   People that sleep nine hours or more, perhaps that reflecting an issue, some underlying
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.440]   issue, perhaps, is being a teenager or an adolescent and undergoing a stage of development
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.680]   where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth, an exception to that, because I don't recall
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.000]   sleeping a ton when I was a teenager.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.880]   I had a ton of energy, but I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.280]   Like they'll just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.840]   Should we let them sleep and sleep and sleep?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   OK.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Let them sleep.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   OK.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   So that's the one exception.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   What about us?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   Just like babies.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   OK.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   When you're developing something in your brain or the rest of your body, you really
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.040]   need sleep to help organize that.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.960]   I mean, sleep is doing really hard work in organizing our brains and making it develop
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   right.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.040]   And if we deprive ourselves of sleep, we will actually also just like I said, we have a
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   daily clock, we also have a developmental clock, and we can miss a developmental window
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.920]   if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.200]   What other things inhibit growth hormone release or other components of this first stage of
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   sleep?
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.680]   In other words, if I go to sleep religiously every night at 10 p.m., are there things that
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.560]   I perhaps do in the preceding hours of the preceding day, like ingest caffeine or alcohol
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   that can make that first stage of sleep less effective even if I'm going to sleep at the
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   same time?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160]   Alcohol definitely will do that because alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant, and it even suppresses
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.400]   some of that stage two transition to REM with those sleep spindles.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.360]   And those sleep spindles, we didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.760]   for moving memories to our cortex.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.400]   It's a unique time when our hippocampus, the sort of like the RAM of our brains, writes
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   it to a hard disk, which is the cortex.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.200]   And it's a unique time when they're connected.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.280]   So if you don't want to miss that, you don't want to miss REM sleep, which is also a part
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.600]   of the consolidation process and schema changing process.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.360]   And alcohol in there, you know, before we go to sleep will do that.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.400]   Until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies, it will affect our sleep
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   badly.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.440]   It's probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol within the four to six hours preceding
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.960]   sleep given the half-life, or it all would be better, but I know some people refuse to
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   go that way.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.600]   And maybe a little bit is okay.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.000]   I don't know what the dose response is, but there are studies out there you can look at.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Great.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.040]   So we're still in the first stage of sleep, and I apologize for slowing us down, but it
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.720]   sounds like it's an incredibly important first phase of sleep.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.680]   What about the second and third 90-minute blocks of sleep?
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.960]   Is there anything that makes those unique?
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.240]   What is their signature besides the fact that they come second and third in the night?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   There's more and more REM sleep the later, the night we get.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.520]   There's also a change in hormones, you know, the growth hormone and melatonin levels are
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.020]   starting to decline, but other hormones are picking up.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.840]   So it is a really different stage that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.720]   And I think that's the stage many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.480]   when the most creativity can happen.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.520]   That's when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   a new way, and our schema are built during that time.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.260]   So yeah, we can change our minds best during those phases of sleep.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
