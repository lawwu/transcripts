[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.220]   Well, we've addressed the challenges of being a Christian loner in APJs 109 and 212.
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.520]   A lot of helpful counsel can be found in that pair of episodes, APJs 109 and 212.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.660]   A listener named Brian heard them and writes in to us with a question that complements
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.120]   what has been addressed previously in those two episodes.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.080]   Brian writes this, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.320]   What would you say is the difference between being a loner who is a Christian and a loner
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.960]   who fails to love the brothers?"
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.480]   As John puts it in 1 John 3:14.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.740]   Is that the same thing?
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.320]   Is being a loner the same thing as being an unloving person?
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.320]   How would you work through this, Pastor John?
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.680]   Well, as often, let's start with a definition.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800]   We can't talk about what we don't know what we're talking about.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800]   So here's my definition.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.960]   I'm just going to choose one of loner.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.560]   A loner is a person who is quite comfortable being alone.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.800]   He's comfortable reading a book in the evening with nobody else in the apartment.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.440]   He's comfortable spending time on his woodworking in the garage with nobody else around.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.540]   She's comfortable working in the kitchen or on her handwork or hiking in the mountains
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.940]   without any friends around.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.640]   So that's what I mean by loner.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.680]   Whether because of genetics or upbringing or experiences later in life, a person now
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.240]   finds himself or herself to be quite comfortable being alone.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.860]   And so the question is, does being a loner mean that you are a person lacking in love
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.200]   for other people?
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.740]   For a long time, I've been fascinated by the fact that human beings are by nature so different
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.240]   from one another.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.920]   And what they're prone to do, what they're bent is so various because of their innate
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.280]   personality.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.240]   And I've been fascinated with what moral significance this has since it seems to be
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.920]   so rooted in our personality and doesn't seem to change essentially when we become
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.400]   Christians.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.980]   So let me give an illustration from the Bible of what I mean and how this fascinates me.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.820]   In Romans 12, verses 6 to 8, Paul gives some instructions about using your spiritual gifts.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.380]   And it's an unusual list.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.280]   Let me just give you the three unusual ones that provoke me and fascinate me and set me
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   to pondering about being a loner.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.820]   He says, "Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:12.240]   Give service in our serving, the one who contributes in generosity, the one who does acts of mercy
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.460]   with cheerfulness.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.460]   Service, giving, mercy."
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.340]   Now what's surprising about calling those spiritual gifts is that all Christians are
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.180]   supposed to serve.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.060]   All Christians are supposed to give.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.740]   All Christians are supposed to be merciful.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.220]   So what is Paul saying?
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.740]   I take Paul to mean that even though these three traits should characterize every Christian,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.740]   nevertheless some people are inclined to them in an unusual way.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.060]   It's just what they're like.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.340]   That's what they do.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.500]   It's just part of them.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   It's part of them.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   They're giving service.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   They're just giving to it.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.960]   Giving, giving, and mercy.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.940]   So here's the inference that I draw.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.100]   There are real differences between human beings, including Christians, in how naturally or
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:26.300]   how readily, dispositionally, we are given to or not given to behaviors that are real
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.340]   Christian duties for everybody.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.860]   And this fact that we are less given to certain good things is not necessarily sinful.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   It doesn't mean we're sinful, that we're committing sin when we don't do those good
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.060]   things to the same degree or with the same intensity with which other people do them.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:03.260]   So you could be more of a loner, or you could be more gregarious or more sociable, and in
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.660]   either case not necessarily be sinning.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.100]   That's what I infer.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:20.000]   And when I ask myself why God designed the world that way, there's an interesting part
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.140]   of the answer in the way Jesus spoke about himself and John the Baptist.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.860]   Here's what he said.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.040]   "To what then shall I compare this people or this generation?
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.780]   They are like children sitting in a marketplace and calling to one another.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.580]   We played the flute for you and you did not dance.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.620]   We sang a dirge and you did not weep."
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.660]   And then he explains, verse 33 of Luke 7.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.340]   "For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.020]   has a demon.'
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.420]   The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look at him, a glutton and
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.580]   a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.180]   Yet wisdom is justified by all her children."
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.940]   So here's the point.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:17.000]   This is an unbelieving generation, and God has exposed their hard-heartedness by showing
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.060]   them that whether a person like John or a person like Jesus speaks to them, they still
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.660]   won't believe.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.620]   John is one kind of person, a real loner, not a party person at all, likes the wilderness.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.180]   And he spoke the truth, and you didn't like it.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.260]   You didn't like the way he said it.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.900]   And then Jesus comes along, and he's very different from John.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.500]   He comes eating and drinking.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.220]   He's sociable, gregarious, attending parties, and you don't like the way he speaks about
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:57.260]   it either, which in God's wisdom shows you can't blame your unbelief on the speaker.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:04.320]   God's wisdom is seen in sending all kinds of different people into your life in order
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.420]   to show that your rejection of them is really owing to your rejection of the message, not
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.900]   the messenger, because he has sent so many different kinds of personalities to you.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:23.160]   You won't have the message, no matter what kind of personality brings it.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.940]   So I'm inferring that one of the reasons God has designed the world with loners and gregarious
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:38.980]   types, among many others, is to make sure the world hears the truth from different vessels,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.020]   different voices, different forms, different personalities, to make clear what the real
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.680]   issue is.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.860]   So my answer to the question whether being a loner means being unloving is thisâ€”not
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.640]   necessarily.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.160]   And I would say exactly the same thing about being a mingler or a gregarious or sociable
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   person.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.220]   Is that person loving?
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.000]   Not necessarily.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.280]   People can need other people for self-centered reasons, and people can love solitude for
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.020]   self-centered reasons.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:22.880]   So the question then finally is what makes the difference between a loner who is self-centered
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.760]   and a loner who is loving?
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.120]   And I would just say two things.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:36.960]   One, the loving loner seeks to purge himself of every form of fear of other people and
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.160]   every form of indifference to the good of other people.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.560]   Everywhere he sees the motive of fear, he seeks to put it to death by the Spirit, according
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.120]   to Romans 8.13.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.440]   Everywhere he sees indifference in his heart toward the good of other people, he seeks
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.520]   to put it to death by the Spirit, trusting God's promises.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.120]   He trusts the promise that God will take care of him, God will help him.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:10.840]   He doesn't need to be governed by any sinful motives like fear of man or indifference to
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.640]   people's good.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:21.160]   And one of the ways that we detect and put to death sinful dimensions of our personality
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:29.840]   like that is by regularly stretching our comfort zone and acting contrary to our natural bent.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:37.680]   Now, I don't mean we cease to be who we are or that we constantly live against the grain
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:45.920]   of being a loner or being gregarious, but I do mean we test ourselves from time to time
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.400]   as to whether we are merely justifying a sinful behavior by a natural inclination.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:59.680]   That's the first test of how we know we're a loving loner or a selfish loner.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Here's the second thing.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:11.440]   What distinguishes a self-centered loner from a loving loner is that the loving loner recognizes
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.520]   his natural inclinations, and instead of trying to totally be a person that he's not, he
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:27.560]   seeks with all his might and by means of all prayer and faith and creativity to make his
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.320]   loner personality a means of love.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.880]   Let me say that again.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.020]   To make his loner personality a means of love.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:47.480]   If he likes being in the garage doing woodworking all by himself, then let him dream and pray
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.200]   and work towards ways of turning his lonely woodworking into a ministry for the good of
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   others.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.640]   If she likes rummaging through historical archives in the library all by herself, let
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:06.400]   her dream of turning her lonely research into a ministry for the good of others.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:16.440]   In other words, you don't have to be paralyzed by the hopelessness of becoming a non-loner
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.520]   in order to be loving.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:26.280]   You just have to really care about turning your loner bent into love.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.720]   Make the loner personality a means of loving others.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   That's a great word.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.400]   And Brian, thank you for this excellent question.

[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.880]   Next week we return to address a sensitive Bible question, a controversial question,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.120]   namely, did Bathsheba sin with David?
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.720]   Was she complicit or was she taken advantage of?
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.400]   Does the Bible have any clues here on what happened?
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.080]   Pastor John says, yes, we have the clues in the text, and he will explain on the other
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.080]   side of the weekend.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
