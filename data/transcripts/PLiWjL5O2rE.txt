[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   - It sounds like friction is something
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.820]   you're very familiar with.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.020]   I just, it's a word just as I feel like it's like
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.960]   cast above us right now in bold face,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.580]   highlighted, underlined letters.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.420]   - Friction is growth.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.240]   - Friction.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.080]   - Yes.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.100]   - Like you're up in the morning
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.500]   and I imagine David Goggins going to the coffee maker,
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.380]   stretching out, good morning, sunshine.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.900]   And you're telling me from eyelids open, there's friction.
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.240]   - Yes, and that is the thing that people don't,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.340]   they don't fucking get.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.060]   The biggest misunderstanding about David Goggins of all time.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.560]   It's like, whether you believe in God or not, I do.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.180]   He put this lab rat, which is me, on this planet.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.180]   And said, let me fucking see what a beat up abused kid
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.480]   who has, who can barely learn, barely learn,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.060]   who has a twisted body, messed up, messed up genetics,
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.560]   sickle cell, this and that.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.880]   Let me give him everything that pretty much disqualifies you
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.080]   from the military.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.280]   But back then, it wasn't as stress,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.920]   and let's put him in this and see what comes out of it.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.200]   So to do that, friction, you don't wake up
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.360]   in the morning time and go to the coffee maker.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.780]   Matter of fact, sometimes you don't even sleep.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.720]   What it requires is when I'm at two o'clock,
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.780]   it's two o'clock in the morning,
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.560]   and my brain is thinking about a fucking drug.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560]   And I got to get up and look in my book
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.720]   to see what that drug is, how I remember it.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.400]   And this is every day of my fucking life.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.760]   That's why when I train a fighter or I train someone,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.320]   I'm like, you have no fucking idea how great you really are.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   Because you are using such minimal,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.920]   minimal of what you have.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.460]   And if people can learn to focus, this is what's possible.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.240]   While it may not be pretty,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.960]   like people want to do a documentary on me.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.240]   I go, no, I don't want you to do a documentary on me.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.780]   Because I will have normal everyday people
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.680]   picking me apart on his life is miserable.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   Who wants to live like that?
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640]   He looks, it's crazy how he's,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.780]   it's almost like he's sick, he's psychotic.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.960]   The most frustrating thing in the world for me
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.560]   is when normal people judge a man like myself
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.980]   It takes every bit of who you are.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.080]   If you choose that route, if you don't,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.640]   Merry Christmas, do what you got to do.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.500]   But yeah, all these things for me,
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.400]   like I told you, I'm going to keep it real.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.080]   I'm not coming here to talk about like,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.360]   you know, perform without purpose.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.620]   'Cause I go through, when I write these books,
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.120]   I go through and I try to dumb down David Goggins.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   How can I give normal people, and I'm normal,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   but I found something that most don't want to find.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.560]   How can I speak to people and give them something
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.040]   from this crazy psychotic brain that I've developed?
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.360]   How can I give them that?
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.400]   So I sit down with Jennifer for years
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.440]   and write down perform without purpose,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.640]   callous your mind, armor your mind,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   the cookie jar, the accountability mirror,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.300]   shit that people can fucking use in their lives.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.480]   No, no, I'm glad it helps you.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.960]   But the barbaric life that I live,
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.200]   that you have to live, the almost obsession
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.340]   that you must have to be great,
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.120]   you can't put that shit in a fucking book, bro.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.640]   You can't put in a book, you can't.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.880]   You can't write about it.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.720]   - It has to be experienced.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.320]   - It has to be experienced.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.020]   And you can't even, after you experience it,
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.280]   to write it in a book, it would seem like
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.080]   he needs to be locked up.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.320]   - Too gory.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.160]   - It's too gory, it doesn't make sense for a guy
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.480]   that everything, every second of the day,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.000]   he is trying to extract more from something.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.360]   He's constantly thinking, he's constantly disciplined,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.200]   never going off the path.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.560]   Whatever is injured on him, he figures away.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.760]   It's a conqueror's mindset.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.040]   And very few people, if any,
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.720]   can really understand what that is.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.840]   Like, I'm almost 50 and I've been this way
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.000]   for almost 30 years.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.600]   Like, what do you do for fun?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.400]   You would never, like these questions,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   I don't get 'em, I don't understand 'em, I don't.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.160]   So, yeah.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.240]   - I get asked that sometimes.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.060]   What do you do for fun?
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.840]   I start listing off all this stuff like podcasting,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.960]   reading, working out.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.040]   But, so some of that resonates,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.800]   but I think what's so truly unusual
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.920]   about what you're describing, your process,
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.680]   is that, you know, from go, it's hard.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.760]   And I have to ask, was being 300 pounds,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.080]   having, I'm using the words you've described,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.400]   you've said it before, you had a tendency
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.360]   at one point in your life, early on, tell lies,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.560]   try and get people's approval.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.240]   - Fly my ass off.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.640]   - Crazy haircuts, attention seeking,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.320]   and yet, all of that triggered something
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.600]   that now is, you know, is extraordinary.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.880]   - Right.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   - Do you think those hardships
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.760]   were necessary to flip the switch?
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.800]   - I don't know if they were necessary,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.260]   but it was something that made me feel,
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.100]   I didn't feel good, it was easy.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.400]   The brain that I was given as a child,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.720]   it was easy to go home and think about what,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.160]   how do I want to be a freak today?
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.840]   How do I want to show up to school today and be a freak?
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.040]   It didn't require me going home and opening a book up
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.720]   saying, it's going to take me all year
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   to learn this fucking page.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.200]   So instead of learning that page,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.440]   I learned how to become a character.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.800]   And maybe that character that I created,
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.880]   that 300 pound insecure guy that used to fake,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.840]   fake it 'til I make it type of guy,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.080]   you know, let me become your friend,
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.480]   let me lie to you until you like me type of guy,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.720]   when you have any kind of, any manhood, womanhood,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.400]   a human being, a soul, a spirit, any,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.360]   I had no, I must have just this much pride,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.840]   'cause that's exactly what opened the door for me.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.400]   'Cause every day you were a character,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.440]   every day you were a clown,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.160]   every day you opened that Spanish book
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.280]   or that science book or English book.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.120]   And you like, you looked at it,
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   it was like, it looked like a foreign language.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.040]   And you're saying, where do I start?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.960]   Well, who do I start?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.560]   And obviously it was necessary.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.080]   The more I talk about it, it was necessary.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   'Cause what happened is I became haunted
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.640]   by the mere fact that this is my existence.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.200]   And you gotta live with that.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.240]   I lived with it for a lot of years.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.560]   And so I sat back and said, okay, all right,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.640]   I know what this takes.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.840]   And when you sit back as fucked up as I was,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.240]   and I had a laundry list, a table like this
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.040]   of what I have to do to become just a human being
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.520]   that can make ends meet,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.680]   that can make a thousand dollars a month just to get there.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.120]   Was like, oh my God, dude.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   Like, I'm 16, 17, I can't read, I can't write.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.520]   And I, oh my God, I'm so behind the power curve.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.800]   And my brain is about being depressed.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.440]   And my dad beat, my mom's not home.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.840]   And kids are calling me nigger at school.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.560]   And I'm like, oh my God, man, what the fuck do I do?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.800]   And it wasn't like someone came around and said,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.100]   hey man, you can do this.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.080]   This is all me.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.280]   So people know, where's this cold man come from?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.580]   I'm not trying to be cold.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.720]   It's the reality of my life.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.360]   It's the reality of a lot of people's lives.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.120]   And so, yeah, that had to happen for me to be haunted,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.920]   to be haunted, to pull out, to extract the guy I am today.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.680]   That haunting is something that's still there today.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.480]   Because no matter how much you improve,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.360]   no matter how much you change who you are,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.180]   it's not permanent.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.800]   You'll just wake up and say, oh my God, man,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.360]   you're David Goggins.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.280]   You break records, you do this, you do that.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   People don't know, how are you able to just be so hard?
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.440]   'Cause I never turned the fucking thing off.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.920]   'Cause once it turns off,
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.180]   I go right back to the David Goggins that is.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.360]   And that's the guy that I'm constantly fighting every day.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.040]   And it's a choice.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.160]   And that choice makes you misunderstood.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.320]   It makes you crazy.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.520]   That's why I hate fucking social media.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.680]   In 2013, people wanted me to write my book.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.080]   I did it in 2018, took five years.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.840]   And the reason why I didn't do it,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.000]   I set a table and Jennifer was there.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.280]   This is before she started working for me,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.200]   I started dating her, whatever.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.900]   And all these people were there.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.600]   And they're like, man, you gotta go on social media.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.560]   And I was like, fuck you, man.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.280]   Like, I'm not, it's poison.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.400]   It's poison because I knew what I did to get where I am.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.800]   And I'm gonna have these people,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.400]   these normal everyday people, fat, lazy,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.040]   is exactly who I was, judging me.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.800]   'Cause I know it, 'cause I was once them.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.560]   All my hard work, all my dedication,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.520]   I'm gonna have some normal dude,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.040]   get his little brownies, little ding-dong, ho-ho Twinkie,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.720]   sit there with his coffee, picking me apart.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.960]   Oh, he must be unhappy.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.160]   He's just, do you know how hard it is
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.960]   to put these shoes on every damn morning?
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.880]   And I'm gonna have you pick me apart?
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   So yeah, there's so much that goes into this
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.480]   that I was like, fuck this.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.280]   I never want anything to do with it.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
