[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   Hello, everyone, and welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, podcast episode number one.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.240]   On this inaugural episode, we have a very special guest, John C. Bogle, founder of the
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.400]   Vanguard Group and creator of the World's First Index Fund.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.360]   [music]
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.640]   Hi, everyone. My name is Rick Ferry, and I am the host of Bogleheads on Investing. This
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.560]   podcast is made available by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3)
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.360]   foundation.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.040]   On each episode, we'll dive deep into the principles of low-fee investing and other
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.720]   financial topics of interest with a special guest. All episodes can be found on Bogleheads.org
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.840]   and the Bogleheads Wiki site. They will also be available on commercial sites such as iTunes
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560]   and SoundCloud.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, today I have with us none other than the man who started it all,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.760]   Mr. John C. Bogle. Let me read to you what Mel Lindauer said when he introduced Mr. Bogle
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.400]   a few years ago at our investing conference. While some mutual fund managers choose to
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.960]   make billions, Jack Bogle chose to make a difference. And I think that exemplifies more
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   than anything our guest today. Good morning, Mr. Bogle. How are you today?
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.080]   Rick, good morning. Please call me Jack.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:59.840]   Thank you. I had the unique opportunity to review your upcoming book, Stay the Course,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.520]   the story of Vanguard and the index revolution. We're going to be talking a lot about that
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.240]   book today. It's a great history of not only Vanguard but of your life as well. I highly
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.680]   recommend when it comes out in November that everyone read it because it's just extremely
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.720]   thorough and a great read for anyone who is interested in the history of Vanguard and
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.800]   in how you got to create this great company.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.320]   Let me read one of the quotes from the book to get this started. And this is from Warren
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.240]   Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, who at the 2017 annual shareholder meeting, which you and
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.840]   some of your family members attended, said this to the audience of 40,000, Jack Bogle
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   has probably done more for the American investor than any man in the country. Jack, could you
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.720]   stand up? And then what happened, Mr. Bogle, or Jack, what happened after that?
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.480]   Well, I'm a little embarrassed to say so. There was an explosion of applause. It seemed
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.640]   like everybody in the audience knew about me. And Warren had prefaced his remarks by
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.800]   saying there ought to be a statue for me. And there happens to be one here in Valley
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.920]   Forge. That's another point. But it was embarrassing and exciting and very uplifting.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.600]   Was that the first annual meeting you had been to?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.160]   Yes, it is. First annual meeting of Berkshire.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.080]   But Mr. Buffett is not new to indexing. In fact, back in 1996, he wrote in his annual
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.680]   report for Berkshire Hathaway, this quote, "Most investors, both institutional and individual,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.000]   will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.360]   minimal fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results after fees and
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.040]   expenses delivered by a great majority of investment professionals." So he was not
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.640]   new to indexing. He's been a fan of yours for a long, long time.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:15.600]   Well, that's 22 years ago, Rick. And I think he was a great profit, P-R-O-P-H-E-T, because
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.360]   the people that listened to him earned great profits, P-R-O-F-I-T.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.000]   There was a lot going on, though, in 1996 in your life and also at Vanguard. The first
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   time I ever heard you speak was in May of 1996. I was at the Atlanta CFA Institute annual
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.520]   conference. And at that time, I was a newly minted CFA for about a year and a half. And
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.000]   I was really having a difficult time with active management. I had done a lot of work
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   analyzing the performance of active managers. And it wasn't coming out the way, I guess,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.920]   CFAs were expecting it to come out, which was, if you're a CFA and you're picking stocks,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.960]   you're supposed to outperform. That's sort of what the CFA Institute was all about.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.920]   Anyway, I'm listening to all the different speakers talking about all the different ways
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.840]   we could outperform. And then you got up on stage. And I remember it quite clearly. You
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.360]   said that this was the first public appearance that you made after having your heart transplant.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   It was pretty exciting to be back on my feet again, Rick. My son, John Vogel, Jr., was
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.760]   the moderator. There were two people, an active manager, I think, and me. And the moderator
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:39.200]   was my son, John Vogel. That was pretty exciting. And if I can add a little family anecdote,
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.580]   my birthday took place, regular birthday, on May 8th, a few weeks later. And he gave
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.840]   me a present down there. We had a nice little family dinner together. He gave me a squash
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.720]   racket. And my wife almost fainted. She didn't think I should ever get back on the squash
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.200]   court. But two weeks later, I was back on the squash court.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   Wow, that's great.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:11.800]   And I don't do that anymore, but I had a couple of decades of playing squash. And it's been
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.200]   quite remarkable and fun and productive, I think, for me to be given an extra 21 years
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   of life.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.120]   And hopefully many more.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.120]   I hope so. But the old body is, the spirit is willing, Rick, but the flesh is weak.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.200]   Well, I could tell you, but the mind is still there. There's no doubt about that. Okay.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.640]   So what happened was, you got up there and you started talking to all of these CFAs,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.440]   who have all been trained to believe they can outperform the market if they work hard
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.680]   enough. And you got up there and you started giving us the facts. And it was pretty blunt,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.360]   very straightforward, not any different than what you have been saying ever since. And
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   basically straight out of your book, the first book that you wrote back in 1993 called Vogel
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.840]   on Mutual Funds, with probably a little bit more detail than even what was in that book.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.080]   And I was sitting there listening to this saying, I just went through this long CFA
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.160]   educational process where I've been trained to believe that if I work hard, I can beat
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.000]   the market. And he's telling me that I can't. And that's exactly what I'm seeing in my data
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.200]   as well, as I analyze money managers and mutual funds.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.640]   I've got to pick up a copy of his book and I've got to read this because there's probably
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.520]   something in it. And I did do that, by the way, I did it in October of 1996. So a few
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:39.000]   months later, I bought the book. And I can remember very clearly when I had my epiphany,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.280]   my big aha moment. It was at a House of Horrors event where my children were going through
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.080]   this House of Horrors right before Halloween. And there was this fake chainsaw in the background
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.480]   and lots of screaming and yelling. And I was sitting in the car waiting for them. And I
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.360]   had the light on and I was reading your book. And I came to some passages in that book which
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:06.880]   just absolutely blew my mind because you were saying in that book absolutely exactly what
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:14.040]   I was seeing in the data that I was analyzing on Mutual Funds. I mean, to the penny. And
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:22.160]   at that point, I realized, I had an epiphany. I realized that I was not alone. That in fact,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.880]   there was a lot of other people out there like me who just didn't believe, that knew
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.680]   that something was wrong and you were doing something about it. And that literally for
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   me, it changed my life. And it changed the direction that I went in my career. And for
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.480]   that, of course, I greatly thank you. And I just wanted to tell you that story that
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.320]   seeing you that first time after you had your change of heart, as you called it, caused
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.040]   me to take a path that actually changed my life.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:58.280]   I appreciate that, Rick. I do my best. And that book was an interesting book. Up to that
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.200]   time, I think it's fair to say there was not a single book on Mutual Funds or a single
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.760]   book that looked at them from those various directions. Certainly, that's true. And I
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.040]   was recommended as the writer by the head of the CFA and to a nice young woman named
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.640]   Amy Hollins who worked for Dow Jones Irwin Publishing, a big publishing house of the
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.560]   day. And she came to me a couple of years earlier and then again and then again asking
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.920]   me to write the book. She said, "Everybody says I'm the only one that can do it." She
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.680]   was being flattering. We men like that when women flatter us. But I said, "Look, I'm trying
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.940]   to run a business. My health is terrible. I just can't do it. I'd like to." But when
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:52.480]   she came in 1990, I think 1992, she'd come each autumn and came in 1992, and I said,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.880]   "I've decided I'm going to write the book. I'll have to work weekends so I don't disturb
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:04.720]   my business stuff. And I'm afraid that I may not live long enough to put it off any longer
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.680]   because I've had trouble with my heart since I was 30 years old when I had my first heart
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.360]   attack." So I did it. It was a tremendous success publication-wise. And it said what
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.560]   I wanted to say. And I look at it every once in a while, and I'm pretty happy with that
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.200]   book actually written. To be candid, I'm not sure I've ever written another book that is
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   that good.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, I would say that that book had the biggest impact. You've written some other books that
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.560]   have had a big impact, but the shockwave that that book sent out through the industry and
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.880]   outside the industry was tremendous. Like I said, it changed lives. But 1996 was also
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   a difficult year for you as well because starting to get into your book a little bit, that was
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.680]   a transition year for Vanguard.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.360]   Yes, it was.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.640]   That was the year that you actually had to step down as the CEO. And I have some question
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:09.120]   about that. You were 65 years old at the time, and you had heart issues. So you stepped down.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.520]   There's a rumor out there, and I just want to clear it up whether it's true or not. Did
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.040]   you actually have something in the bylaws at Vanguard that said that at 65, you had
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   to retire?
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   Absolutely not.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:27.200]   Well, for two reasons. First, my health was extremely uncertain. Many, many years before,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.000]   one doctor told me I would probably not live till I was 40. And I've struggled with it
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.800]   all those years in and out of hospitals, whether it's in Boston or Philadelphia or Bryn Mawr,
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.640]   Pennsylvania, wherever it might be. And I thought I owed it to the shareholders to make
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.480]   sure that there was a continuity of management. So that was the first thing I was dealing
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   with hard.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.640]   And second, you know, sometimes in this world, we get older, and we aren't quite aware of
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:05.720]   it, and we overrate what we can do. And the aging process, although I didn't feel it personally,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.000]   was something that was very much in my mind. I thought it was time for the old guys to
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.720]   make room for younger guys.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.960]   But by that time, Vanguard was the second largest mutual fund company behind Fidelity
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.880]   at the time. So you had really grown the company. And you had also, by that time, introduced
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   all of the basic broad market index funds, everything from the total market to a bond
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   fund. I think the REIT fund was introduced in '96, the total international index fund.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.920]   So you had the portfolio of index funds were in place at the time. The framework was in
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.560]   place at Vanguard to bring that company forward. Isn't that correct?
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.840]   Well, you're absolutely right. So you could say that another thing that was on my mind
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:05.240]   was the fact that I put together the basics, the index basics, for the entire enterprise
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:13.160]   in terms of centrality and acceptance. They were all there. So the die was cast, if you
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:20.440]   will. And those funds that you identify, total stock market, 500, total bond market, total
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.720]   international, all those funds that I started are our largest funds today.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.120]   Which is interesting, Rick, and that is we're talking over a decade ago, and we have had
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.440]   no innovation in any of those funds. They're the same as they were then. Try and tell that
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:45.480]   to Steve Jobs or the guys at Google, a company with no innovation in its basic product line
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.680]   for what would now be 12 years or 14 years.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.080]   No, and I'll have to tell you something else, too. It's something else I learned from you
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.040]   more recently than when I first had the epiphany and started converting all of my business
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   and such to indexing was that those funds, those core funds that we talked about, are
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.160]   all you need. As I get older, and I just turned 60 this year, my thinking has been shifting
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.720]   even more and more to the way you've been talking about, even though I've been a follower
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.360]   of yours for almost 22 years, 23 years, and I made the switch that long ago, I am only
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.400]   now beginning to see the true genius of what you've done as far as...
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.880]   Thank you.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:37.000]   As far as the simple, broad market index funds in the U.S. and the bond market, maybe international,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.520]   maybe some real estate, just very simple index fund portfolio is all you really need. And
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.200]   everything else is just icing on the cake or the flavor of the icing on the cake that
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:56.280]   probably costs you more money and in the end probably doesn't do anything more for you.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   You make a good point. Staying the course, the name of the book, or stay the course is
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.480]   all about buying something that's solid, well-diversified, and holding on to it forever. And to give the
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.360]   usual phrase that I do, Rick, that follows that, to enjoy the miracle of the compounding
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:20.560]   returns without it being eaten away by the tyranny of compounding investment costs.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.920]   If you want to think of anything, someone once said, "All this poor guy Vogel has going
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.680]   for him is an uncanny ability to recognize the obvious." And I think that's fair. They
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.560]   may have thought it was a criticism. I think it may well be a compliment.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.800]   Well, you call this the index revolution in your book, and I think that's what it was.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.920]   You also are trying to coin another phrase, and I want to bring that out so that we can
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.760]   all understand what that is. You've been working on coining a phrase called TIF, or Traditional
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:58.040]   Index Funds, and I want you to explain what you mean by that relative to all other index
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   funds.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.420]   Well, I'm delighted to do it because I've tried it about 10 times, 10 speeches, maybe
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:14.240]   in public appearances, and it has yet to be adopted. I wanted to contrast ETFs with TIS,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:23.000]   Exchange Traded Funds, with Traditional Index Funds. The basic difference, Rick, is Traditional
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:32.320]   Index Funds are passive funds held by passive investors, and Exchange Traded Funds are passive
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   funds held by active investors. Therein lies a world of difference.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.760]   What the statistical services do is talk about ETFs and then mutual funds, so they mix, in
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.480]   the other part of the equation, they mix index funds, Traditional Index Funds, with actively
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.360]   managed funds. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense. I tried, I wrote to all the leaders
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.560]   of the statistical thing about a year ago and said, "Here's what you have to do. Here's
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.100]   what the data look like," and I didn't even get a single answer to my letter.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.040]   They didn't answer you? Interesting.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.680]   But I haven't given up hope, you know me.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:18.280]   Okay, well, I have a thought on this, okay, because I did read into this a little bit.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:25.760]   When I first heard you say Traditional Index Funds, my mind said the Vanguard, say, Total
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.720]   Stock Market, or an S&P 500 that tracks a market index and only tries to achieve the
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.560]   return of the market index. I didn't differentiate in my mind whether it was a mutual fund or
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.400]   whether that was done in an exchange-traded fund because, to me, it was the strategy of
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.920]   the fund itself where you have traditional index funds and then you have all of these
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.520]   other factor funds and everything else that's trying to, active management that's trying
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   to make believe that it's an index for the purpose of confusing people.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:09.200]   So that was what I thought when I first read and first heard you talking about TIF. I think
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.480]   that might be some of the confusion there.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:18.280]   Well, I'm working on it, and I try to explain it a little more fully because it's not an
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:25.520]   oral black-and-white thing. Let me try this one. There are 1,000 ETFs that are concentrated
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:32.680]   in a special areas, buy short, long short, a single country and on, 1,000 out of 2,000.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:40.160]   This data is a little bit old. And 63% in diversified U.S. stocks. In the traditional
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:49.100]   index area, there are 69 diversified U.S. stocks and only 140 trading funds. So the
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:55.600]   distinction is quite clear. And when you look at the data, you see that ETFs, over half
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.280]   of their assets is in either factor funds or concentrated or speculative funds, where
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:10.960]   only 10% of the assets, maybe 12% of such funds, the factors, the smart betas, the concentrated
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.080]   and the speculative, 10% of the assets are in those kind of funds in traditional index
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   fund form.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.720]   So it's not a clean break, but it's an obvious break. And I'm going to keep after TIS until
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.340]   the day I die. So stand back, world.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.480]   Okay. We have been warned. All right. Well, let's go ahead and continue to get into your
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.360]   book. "Stay the Course. The Story of Vanguard and the Index Revolution." There were four
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.800]   parts to it. The history of Vanguard, the Vanguard funds themselves, which I found very
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:51.120]   interesting. Then looking ahead and a concluding memoir.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.440]   Now here is something that you wrote, which I find interesting, and I think it might typify
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:02.080]   your association with Vanguard, with the company Vanguard. You wrote in here that when you
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.200]   were writing this book, that you requested to review the corporate minutes of the Vanguard
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.080]   mutual funds during the long period which you served as a chairman, but that was denied
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   by Vanguard. You know, a lot of people think that you still run Vanguard in many ways.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.000]   I get letters from them every day.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.480]   From people who are asking you to fix things at Vanguard?
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.760]   All right. So maybe I can rephrase this to, you know, what is your current relationship
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.800]   with Vanguard? I mean, how does it work?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:38.160]   Well, and to be candid, I don't have much of a relationship with Vanguard because I'm
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.160]   out. I don't participate in the management at all. I think that's appropriate. I'm not
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.280]   complaining about it. I get no information. The shareholder writes me. I have no access
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.200]   to their records, but that's fine because I don't run the place anymore. I moved over
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.720]   to let other people run it, and they are running it. So they don't, I mean, I think if they
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.840]   ever want my advice, they know they can get it any time, but, you know, they think they
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.880]   know more because they're in the business currently on a daily basis. I have no doubt
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.040]   they think they know more than I do, and they certainly know more than I do about the current
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.800]   moments in the business, cash flows, things of that nature.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.000]   Oh, I must say, there's so much public information that I'm still very well informed about those
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.960]   areas, but look, when you retire from the, I don't even want to use the word retire because
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.200]   I'm anything but retired, but when you leave the position of chief executive, even if you're
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.960]   the founder of the firm, and that's an important distinction, the new guys want to take over,
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:49.600]   should take over, and the old guys should move out of the way. I didn't want to move
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.760]   out of the way because the founder, I think, is in a different position than a mere previous
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:02.320]   CEO, and it's certainly true, as you suggest, that I am still, for better or worse, the
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.520]   face of Vanguard to many, many people, many shareholders, the public, the media, and so
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.520]   on.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.320]   Well, that's a great answer. Thank you, Jack. I'm going to get back to your book and start
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.960]   talking about where it all began, which in your book, you start talking about Princeton
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:28.880]   and your 1951 essay, and you referenced that as the beginning of your introduction and
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.480]   analysis, and quite detailed analysis because I read the thesis a few years ago, of the
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:43.280]   mutual fund industry as it was back then, and in your thesis, you talk about one mutual
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   fund company. You talk about a lot of them, but one of them you talked about was Wellington,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:55.960]   and at the time, Walter Morgan, Mr. Morgan, was the president or the CEO, founder of Wellington.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.640]   CEO and founder.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:03.760]   Yes, and also, something I didn't know until I read your book, he is also a Princeton graduate,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.240]   class of 1920. That's going to be 1920. Well, I'm 100 years ahead.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:17.280]   1920. I met Mr. Morgan when he was 50 and knew him for 50 years. He died about three
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.660]   weeks after his 100th birthday. A great man.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.240]   Did you meet him while you were writing your thesis?
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.760]   It's possible that I did because I met him on the Princeton campus, but we didn't have
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.400]   any discussion about the nature of the business or anything like that until I sent him a copy
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.560]   of the thesis afterward.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.600]   There was a lot of analysis in your thesis about the mutual fund industry at the time,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.080]   and you must imagine that when you were writing that thesis, you went to these mutual fund
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.440]   companies, which at the time were different than they are now. Most of the mutual funds,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.480]   as you wrote in your book, mutual fund companies just basically had one fund. They were started
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.280]   to manage one fund as opposed to the way the fund industry now is where fund companies
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.640]   have multiple, multiple funds.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.320]   I didn't have an opportunity to visit people. I called them mostly on the phone. I did visit
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:16.200]   one fund manager for Calvin Bullock in New York because my uncle knew him, and we had
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:24.040]   lunch together up there in the New York Bankers Club, but I did not get a lot of input from
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:30.000]   the industry people themselves. I got what I could from the ICI, which was next to nothing,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.920]   and then I got a lot from the admittedly limited coverage in the media, but the whole history
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.840]   of the industry as told in the Investment Company Act of 1940 through the hearings that
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.680]   were held in 1939 and 1940, so I had a lot of input, a lot of facts, a lot of chances
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.840]   to make up my mind.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.600]   I also relied, I should add, I don't know if you'll remember this or not, but we used
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.200]   to have the Wiesenberger Annual Publication called Investment Companies.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   Yeah, I remember.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.200]   It came out every year.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.800]   I'm that old. Yes, I remember.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.720]   And it had the performance records of every fund year by year. In those days, performance
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.520]   was not something that was kind of right out there for everybody to look at. It was not
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.200]   a big deal, if you will.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.640]   At the time, 1951, what was the benchmark?
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.240]   The average that people looked at was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, right there,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.440]   and that's a very imperfect index, as you know. In the long run, of course, it gives
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.520]   returns similar to the S&P 500, but in the short run, it's very tricky, sometimes better,
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.440]   sometimes worse, and on a daily basis, it can be absolutely crazy because it's only
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.240]   got 30 stocks and they're weighted by price, so a high-priced stock does some big jumping
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:58.880]   around and it's changed a lot. It was a happy day when we picked the S&P 500 as the basis
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.960]   for our index fund.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.400]   I actually talked with people over at S&P when you negotiated that contract, and I think
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:16.280]   David Blitzer, who was the head of the S&P committee, I was speaking with him. I believe
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:23.120]   that he told me a story that you came in and said, "We'd like to license the S&P 500 and
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.320]   make a fund out of it," and they didn't know what to do because nobody had really come
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.120]   to them with that, and you had to try to negotiate how much they were going to charge you to
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:40.720]   do that, and I recall a number of about $25,000 a year they just threw out there, and you
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.520]   said, "Okay." Is that how it worked? Is that how it happened?
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:51.720]   It's pretty close, although as a sideline, David, and I think I'm quoting him accurately,
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.600]   and David said in retrospect what they were really thinking then was how much were we
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:02.060]   going to charge them for giving this new attention to the S&P 500?
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.060]   You have.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.400]   It's all changed now, but their fees are outrageous.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:11.320]   Yeah, well, it's become a big business, indexing now that index funds are licensing, fund companies
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.440]   are licensing indexes. Of course, that is their business now, so all the indexes that
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.600]   are created are created for the sole purpose of becoming a product as opposed to measuring
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.760]   something or something of economic value, so things have really changed in the indexing
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.440]   industry as well, which speaks to, by the way, the difference between, in my mind, a
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:35.040]   traditional index versus these other things, and that's what I was thinking, getting back
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.520]   to your traditional index fund concept.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.920]   Well, the traditional index funds, you're right, and I may have not done a good job
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:50.680]   in articulating the difference, but basically, the true traditional index funds, and we're
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.880]   trying to make a mix, it's not necessarily easy to make, but they're funds that are designed
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:04.240]   to be bought and held forever, and that means very large, broadly diversified funds, 500
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:11.000]   post-stock market, total international, maybe total emerging markets, and total bond market,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.980]   and now you can do reasonable variations on that, and one of the obvious ones is municipal
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.320]   bonds are not included in that bond market, and a lot of wealthy people, a lot of potential
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:27.480]   clients need municipal bond funds, and so you have to have a long and an intermediate
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:36.120]   in short, that's the concept we introduced here at Vanguard in 1974, I think, and making
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   the investor choose between long, intermediate, and short.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.200]   The muni-municipal bond industry doesn't really have a very good index, so it's an index fund
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.240]   without being a formal index fund.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.840]   It has an extremely high correlation with the index, as you see, but they're very hard
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.360]   to match because the municipal bond has so many different areas of so many little bonds
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.800]   and different call provisions and all that, and it's worked very, very well.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.400]   Our muni funds, long, intermediate, and short, and limited term, have a very high correlation,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:15.120]   certainly in the mid-90s, with the indexes as they exist, so they're quasi-index funds
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   or something like that.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.520]   Well, I can tell you a story about those funds, those three funds.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:26.680]   I used to manage several hundred million dollars of municipal bonds for clients of mine, and
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.860]   they were all basic bond ladders from one to 10 years, state-specific and all of that,
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:38.360]   and I was looking for a benchmark to determine how I should rate my performance as a manager
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.080]   of municipal bonds to the general municipal bond market.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   I could not find a municipal bond index that worked, so I used a combination of the Vanguard
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   Limited Term Municipal Bond Fund and Intermediate Term Municipal Bond Fund, which the duration,
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:05.560]   the average maturity, if you will, of those funds combined equaled what my portfolio looked
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:13.040]   like, and so I was able to benchmark my portfolio of municipal bonds to something that was a
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:19.640]   better index of municipal bonds than the indexes themselves, and by the way, because of that,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.400]   I stopped managing municipal bonds and went to all Vanguard bond funds.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.240]   Well, it's hard to beat the deal, because trading costs in the municipal bond business
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:37.200]   are very high, as you know, but we have become, through that idea of long, intermediate, and
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:43.400]   short gave us an important role, we were late entrant, as you read in the book, late entrant
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.960]   into the municipal bond area, and all of a sudden, we changed the way the bond industry,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.100]   bond fund industry worked.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.960]   Everybody went to long, intermediate, short, and it's so much smarter, so much better for
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:03.640]   the client, and so much greater clarity as to whether a fund is doing well or ill.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:10.120]   I have to add, Rick, that I was not unaware an index or whatever it might be in the segments,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.600]   like long, intermediate, and short, the more important low cost becomes.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:22.400]   Low cost is a very valuable differentiator in the total municipal bond market, but an
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.920]   invaluable, totally invaluable, extremely deterministic, really, when you break down
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   the market by maturities, holding quality constant.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   Well these things that we take for granted now, when we look back and see where they
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.120]   came from, a lot of the great innovations that are out there today that everyone is
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.760]   using have come from you and your work at Vanguard, which is amazing in itself, and
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.480]   as I read the book, all of this comes out, the first factor funds, you know, the value
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.280]   and growth, you were the first to come out with that.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:00.080]   Funny story, we have in this day a factor fund, which by and large I do not approve
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   of.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.600]   I don't think there are factors that are permanently good.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:10.920]   So why are we the starters, the creators of the first growth index fund and the first
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.080]   value index fund, both of which are the two largest factor funds in the field according
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.920]   to Morningstar, by far, and the reason I did it had nothing to do with one doing better
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   than the other.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.720]   And if you look at my annual reports written to the shareholders in those days, it said,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:33.080]   look, it's really designed to accumulate money on the growth side, in the growth index, and
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.000]   have a very low taxable tax rate.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.360]   And then when you retire, you can move over to the value side and have a little less volatility
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   and more income.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.880]   It was a financial planning kind of an idea.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.760]   And I said, don't try and pick one over the other for performance, because I'm going to
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.680]   tell you that the most likely event is that they will both have the same returns over
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.320]   the next 25 years, or I'm not sure I used 25 year period, same long run returns.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:09.200]   Well, 25 years later, they both had returns of 9%.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.180]   And the devil in the detail is that investors didn't do what I told them, traded them back
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:20.800]   and forth, and don't hold me to this exact number, but I think investors in the value
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.400]   fund had a return of about 5%, investors compared to the funds themselves, and investors in
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.800]   the growth fund had a return of about 7%.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:36.360]   That would be 4 percentage points and 2 percentage points less than the returns of the fund itself.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   And that's the problem with any fund that involves trading.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.640]   So they were started for the right reasons, I think, and maybe I was just too dumb to
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.680]   realize that people wouldn't take my advice about how to use them.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.220]   I am proud of my forecast, though, because I don't know how many people would have agreed
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:58.680]   with me that growth and value would do the same for 25 years, particularly 25 years ago
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.640]   when everybody thought value was going to do well forever.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.160]   Rick, nothing does well forever.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.520]   As you wrote in your book, it works until it doesn't.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   Exactly.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:18.560]   The reality is, value, I mean, you see the data, you see the annual returns, value is
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.240]   unquestionably the leader.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.880]   If you go back to the late 1920s is when these things began.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.680]   But if you go back 25 years, they're the same.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.920]   They come and go, and their returns over the last roughly 25 years are identical.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:42.400]   So the value advantage did not persist, persisted for a long time, and in my opinion, the reason
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   it didn't persist was everybody started to recognize it and act on it, which in theory
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:53.520]   at least means you bid up the price of value stocks and bid down the price of growth stocks,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.640]   and then they perform the same.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.600]   This is the market as a great arbitrageur between the past and the future.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.800]   But we are all susceptible to making mistakes and sort of getting on the bandwagon.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.520]   I'm going to go back to some earlier history.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:17.280]   You were hired by Mr. Morgan after you graduated from Princeton, and you worked there and you
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:25.960]   became his heir apparent pretty much by the beginning of, by the mid-60s if you will.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:34.080]   Actually, if I can correct you, Rick, in the mid-60s, that is to say in 1967, he called
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.840]   me into his office and said, "I want you to run the company from now on.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.520]   I don't want to do it anymore, it's a crazy business."
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.480]   So that was a little more than his heir apparent, that was his heir.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:52.840]   And you then said, "Well, this is the go-go era, if you will, and this is all in your
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:59.560]   book," and you've talked about it many times, how you made the decision that you needed
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.960]   to bring on a growth manager into the company.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.400]   And that is what you did.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.840]   You went out and you hunted down and looked for a growth manager who you ended up bringing
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.560]   on, partnered with, you know, it was a publicly traded company at that time, but they ended
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.840]   up having majority control.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:26.400]   And that, as you said, worked for a while until it didn't, and that ultimately caused
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   you to get fired, which started the restart.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.800]   And you go into this in a lot of detail in the book, so I don't want to take too much
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:44.600]   time about it, but my point was that you learned the hard way that there's a cycle or a wave
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.800]   between growth and value, and it really cost you, at least at the time, it seemed like
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:55.280]   it was costing you, it almost cost you your entire career, because you got on the bandwagon.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.400]   Let me just correct you ever so slightly.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:04.120]   We had a balance fund, the most conservative balance fund, and since there was a few of
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   them, we were often the industry leader in cash flow.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   It's amazing.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.960]   The Wellington Fund was our only fund up until 1958.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:19.840]   When the balance fund share of industry cash flow dropped from 40% to 1%, it doesn't make
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.480]   a genius to figure we better do something about that.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:31.520]   And the original idea was to bring in or join forces with a firm that was strong in equities.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.560]   So the firms I looked at were the firms you would recognize today.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:46.120]   American funds would be the most obvious out of Los Angeles, the Capital Group.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.440]   They were not interested.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:55.200]   I talked to a fund called Incorporated Investors, a stand-alone pioneer from Boston stock fund,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.980]   and they were not interested.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:02.560]   I talked to a little tiny group of funds, mostly equity funds, in New York City who
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:11.280]   had I think it's $24 million worth of assets, tiny, tiny, in five funds or six funds, and
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   they were not interested.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Well, that was Franklin.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.480]   Charlie Johnson said, "You know, I don't know if there's ever going to be a match to anything,
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.960]   but it's a family thing, and I think I'd just as soon stay independent and see what happens."
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.540]   He was smart.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:31.620]   So finally I came up, the only thing I could do, which was okay in a way, was to bring
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:38.960]   in a company that had four professional managers, four professional investors, and turned out
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.440]   a go-go fund, which was called Ives Fund.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:48.260]   So that was my best opportunity, but not my most desirable opportunity.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:53.380]   I wanted to do something with a more middle-of-the-road fund, and if you can't do it, you do the second
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.940]   best, because we had to act.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   We were dying.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.340]   We were going into an era where there were 83 consecutive months of redemption.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.820]   Well, you brought them on, and that worked for a while.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:10.700]   It seemed like you caught the second half of the go-go era, and things were going well
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.980]   for a while, although for Wellington, it still didn't stop the hemorrhaging of money because
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.020]   people just weren't interested in those funds anymore.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.940]   I mean, the whole world was going go-go in a way.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.540]   Well, let me come back to that.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.420]   They said when the merger came along, my new partners, "We can't wait to get" -- I think
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.100]   this is in the book -- "can't wait to get our hands on a Wellington fund," and when
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.260]   they did, they ruined it.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.340]   It had the worst 10-year record under their direction of any balanced fund in the industry,
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.340]   the worst.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:47.420]   It's just hard to be last, Rick, in this world, it has to be first, so they ruined it because
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:52.700]   they turned it into go-go a fund, and the portfolio manager wouldn't listen to me when
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.700]   I told him it was too aggressive.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.980]   It's all in the book.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   I made a mistake.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.940]   There's no question about that, and maybe I should have looked for yet another merger
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.940]   partner.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.740]   Well, we're all very glad you made that mistake, Jack, quite frankly, because what happened
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.780]   as a result of that was nothing less than absolutely phenomenal.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:21.780]   When you eventually got fired by the Wellington board, you still retained your position as
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:29.620]   the fund chairman of the funds, and I want you to explain to the people who are listening
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:37.300]   the difference between being the CEO, the chairman of an asset manager who is making
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.260]   the investment decisions in funds and the fund itself.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.300]   There's actually two different boards.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.220]   You were fired from one, but you did not get fired from the other.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.220]   Could you explain that?
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.220]   Yes, I can.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:54.620]   First, the funds, the mutual funds, the mutual funds of the group, are pretty much no more
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.460]   than corporate shells.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.700]   They hire a manager to do everything that they need to stay in existence.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:09.420]   They hire an outside manager to manage the portfolio, an outside manager to do the financials
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:15.020]   and shareholder record-keeping, an outside manager to do the marketing and distribution.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:21.620]   All the same firm, so the fund and the firm are pretty much wrapped up and bound together
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.300]   in the industry, and nothing like this had ever happened before.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:32.200]   Generally speaking, when the manager, which is the controlling firm, fired, when the manager
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.980]   fired its president, the fund fired its.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.980]   They were in lockstep.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.460]   Why didn't that happen here?
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.100]   Because we still had directors from the old Wellington Management Company that I had run
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.940]   on the board, and they were barely a majority, and I tell that story in there, how close
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:57.660]   they came to being a non-majority, but they believed in me, and they didn't want me thrown
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:03.100]   out by these managers who had done, in fact, a terrible job, and why they kept them around
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.300]   to manage the money, I'll leave to wiser heads than mine.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:13.000]   So, the fund, all of a sudden, became something, in effect, that had never become before.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.440]   An operating firm, the chief executive who did something, who had no conflicts of interest,
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.880]   and a small staff, 28 for us, to do mostly accounting, because we couldn't do marketing,
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.160]   we were not allowed to get into marketing, we were not allowed to get into investment
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   management.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.660]   All we could do was administration and shareholder record keeping, which is essentially the third
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.100]   leg of the mutual fund stool.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.660]   I knew, as I explain in the book, that we would get nowhere if we're just running this
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.760]   old skeleton of an administrative company.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:52.600]   So, we had to take over investment management, and we had to take over marketing, both of
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.320]   which we were pledged not to do, but we did anyway.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:01.980]   Well, it took a while, but you were able to convince the board, the other board members,
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:09.520]   in the fund itself, and the book is very detailed about how this happened, to allow you to take
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:15.340]   over, and one of the ways in which that occurred was through your idea, or your invention,
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.560]   if you will, of an index mutual fund.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.760]   The very first one, by the way, there had been a few attempts, as you talk about in
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:31.460]   the book, of doing an index, S&P type index, investment pool in various places like Wells
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:36.400]   Fargo, but no one had attempted to do it within a mutual fund that was going to be available
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.520]   to the general public.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:44.040]   So, you came up with the idea of doing that at Vanguard, and you said to the board, if
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:50.560]   I recall, "We're not managing, we're not picking the stock, so we're not the manager, so we're
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:58.440]   within the charter," and then you were able to convince them to allow you to start a S&P
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.440]   500 fund.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.120]   If I might jump ahead one point, you originally tried to sell this fund through the broker-dealer
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.640]   industry with a commission, true?
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.200]   That is true.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.080]   Well, you have to get some money in the fund, and in those days, you didn't just put out
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.880]   a shingle and say, "Please send your money in," we put together an underwriting group,
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.200]   and they thought we could do $250 million, and they did 11.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.920]   It was a complete failure.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.080]   It was the worst underwriting probably in the history of Wall Street.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.880]   So, how did they fail?
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.280]   I guess they failed because it was a really lousy idea, Rick.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:44.440]   Well, no, if I recall, the commission that was being charged was lower than the commission
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.520]   of, say, selling an American fund.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.920]   Wasn't the commission maybe 5% or 4% versus 8%?
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.200]   It was 5%, and in those days, the normal commission was 7.5% to 8%.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.880]   So knowing the mentality of brokers, which I was one for 10 years, why on earth would
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:09.380]   I, as a broker, want to put my client's money in a fund that only pays me a 5% commission,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.520]   in an untested product, by the way, when I could put my client's money in something like
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:20.280]   an American funds or some other fund that paid me 8.5%?
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:26.840]   And the fact that the actively managed funds do this payola.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:32.720]   They do their brokerage trading with the firms that sell their shares, sometimes directly,
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.440]   sometimes what was called a give up in those days.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.480]   You do the business with a firm like maybe Goldman Sachs, and they give up half of the
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.160]   commission to the firm that's selling to you.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:48.440]   Don't ask me how that's legitimate, and it proved not to be legitimate eventually.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.000]   But in any event, here's a fund that's not going to do any trading at all.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.560]   And it was not a broker's product, but we had to get some money in at the beginning.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.440]   And we tried and tried and tried.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:08.600]   I don't know how many pairs of shoe leathers I wore out, trying to find first an underwriter
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:15.420]   and then trying to travel the country with these sales meetings and introduction meetings.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.600]   And it all came to basically a failure.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.640]   But we had the first index fund.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.660]   And you also did manage to bring in, what was it, $11 million?
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:31.280]   I know you were trying to get about $150 million, but you did manage to get $11 million.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.560]   And there's where the leap of faith occurred when you said to the board that you wanted
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.440]   to go ahead and launch the fund anyway, and they, in their wisdom, agreed to go ahead
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   and do it.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.600]   Yeah, there was no issue about that.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:52.520]   The issue starting, we started, we formed the fund in September of 1975, which was only
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   a few months, five months after we began operations in May '75, four months.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.000]   And so we did it almost immediately.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.080]   It was the first strategic thing we did at Vanguard.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.240]   And we did it fast.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:13.200]   The underwriting took place less than a year later, August of '76.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:19.080]   It was, it's amazing what a struggle we had.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.280]   And yet it's also amazing when you look at there, there's a lot of funny stuff going
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.960]   on out there about starting the first income account and this and that.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.920]   And you look at all the people that did it, and there are five or six or seven or eight
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.400]   claimed to be first in indexing.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.800]   None of them exist anymore.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.400]   None of them exist anymore.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:44.840]   And that one first index mutual fund is now one of the two largest funds in the world.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.920]   So first or not, we're certainly first now.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.640]   But when you took in the $11 million, there was a decision that needed to be made.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.200]   So you did the underwriting.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   You wanted to bring in $150 million.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   It was a dismal failure.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.120]   You only brought in about $11 or $11.5 million.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.680]   How do you launch an S&P 500 fund with $11.5 million?
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.640]   You can't even buy all 500 stocks.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   So what did you do?
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:12.480]   Well, you can't buy all 500 stocks in round lots, and you don't want to buy non-round
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.120]   lots because it's too expensive.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.120]   So we did a sampling.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:20.900]   And I think the original portfolio was around 275 stocks.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.440]   And if you sample by having a certain run amount in each industry, for example, you're
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.120]   going to come very close to the returns.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.880]   I mean, first, stocks had a lot of commonality in their performance, stocks as a group.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.320]   And when you get the industry, that's an even more greater commonality.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.480]   In other words, if you have six airline stocks at 6% of the index, and you own only one of
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:47.280]   them, or maybe two, you're going to track that just as well as if you own all of them.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280]   And we did.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.560]   The tracking was not as precise as we do today.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   Couldn't be.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:58.520]   It was actually run by a part-time young woman who had her full-time job was in her husband's
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.920]   furniture store in Wilmington, Delaware.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   But she did fine.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.320]   It wasn't sophisticated like it is today.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.720]   That was your portfolio manager.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.520]   It was a woman who worked for you who, it was a part-time job.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:15.680]   She was managing the first S&P 500 Index Fund portfolio part-time while she also worked
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.520]   in her husband's furniture shop full-time.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.520]   Right.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   It's just unbelievable.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   Well, I'm going to skip ahead a little bit because it is-
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:32.120]   Yeah, because I'm often found to say, "You can't make this stuff up."
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:38.400]   I'm going to move ahead a little bit because I know we've spent some time, considerable
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.440]   time so far, and this could go on for a long time because I started printing out all the
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.640]   things I wanted to talk about from your book and I ended up, I got 50 pages printed and
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.580]   I just stopped because there's so much stuff to talk about.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.880]   But there's one thing I do want to talk about.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:58.600]   When you turned the S&P 500 fund from a load fund where it was sold through brokers into
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:04.620]   a no-load, and that was a new concept, and you also merged one of the Wellington funds
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:10.920]   into the S&P 500, and that gave you enough money to finally buy all 500 stocks, and you
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.120]   were no-load, and you at that time, you got permission to do your own marketing, so now
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.920]   you were a full-fledged, Vanguard became a full-fledged company with all three legs.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.200]   I mean, you were able to do the administration, you were able to do the marketing, and you
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.520]   were able to do the management.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.880]   We were ready to compete in the full line mutual fund field, and stand back everybody,
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   here comes Vanguard.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:39.080]   And here you came, but very, very slowly because if I recall, it took you something like 10
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:45.160]   or 11 or 12 years for the Vanguard S&P 500 fund to actually get its first billion dollars.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.400]   It wasn't like it just, it didn't explode.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:57.880]   It was so slow, it was awful, and yet you had to keep running the company as if it would
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:05.960]   come sooner or later, and it did, and we started in 1974 with a billion five, by 1990, we were
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:15.200]   at 55 billion, but less than 10% of our assets were in index funds, less than five billion.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:22.320]   Then the boom comes, we're now 78% of our assets in index funds, even in the 2000s,
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:30.880]   2010, we were 60%, so the momentum of indexing and the Vanguard way, the mutuality, and they
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:36.760]   go together, by the way, Rick, if you're not mutual, you really don't want to be in the
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   index business.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:43.480]   As I've often said, all the damn money goes to the clients, and managers don't like that.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.200]   They want all the money to go to them, and they compromise and give half of the money
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   to the clients.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   That's a little hyperbole.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.320]   I wanted to talk about a story where you went to the SEC and you asked them, you submitted
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:01.400]   a filing to do the first bond index fund, and you got a lot of pushback on that, where
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.240]   they said, "No, you can't call it an index fund because you're not buying all of the
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.560]   bonds in the index," so you had to call it something else originally.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:19.520]   An interesting sidelight is when we work with the SEC, I travel alone, no lawyers, no retinue,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.080]   and nobody at my side to tell me what to do, and nobody to consult with.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.000]   I'm confident to do it myself, and I think it looks better to the SEC.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.440]   They always have a room full of people, and they wonder who this funny non-lawyer is,
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:39.720]   so we get down to present this, and they are hardly expert on the name.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.960]   They wanted to talk about the name, and they said, "Look, we're just not going to let you
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:51.000]   call it Vanguard Bond Index Fund," and I said, "Okay, we'll call it Vanguard Bond Market
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Fund."
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.640]   They said, "That's fine," and then I said, "But we'll refer to it as the Vanguard Bond
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.880]   Market Index Fund."
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.280]   They said, "That's fine, just as long as you don't put it in the name," so it was fun to
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   do.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:10.320]   What I didn't realize when I was reading your book was that Vanguard manages something like
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:17.560]   25% now of all fixed income assets in mutual funds.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:23.680]   It's a phenomenal amount of money that Vanguard manages in bonds, most of which are in bond
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.120]   index funds, so this has been an incredible growth area.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   Once you finally got it...
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:34.920]   Yeah, but we also manage about 25% of all the money in equity funds.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:41.600]   Our total market share is 25%, and bonds are actually a little below that, and stocks are
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.280]   a little bit higher than that.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.120]   I'm going to go back to active management, though, because I found something in your
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.440]   book which I found very interesting.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   I hadn't read it before, but you put in your book what you call Vanguard's four P's in
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:54:01.980]   evaluating fund managers, and you're talking about active managers, because Vanguard traditionally,
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.320]   like you said, until 1990, 95% of the assets into Vanguard were actively managed, so you
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:16.000]   had to create some sort of a system or methodology for choosing the active managers who you were
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.680]   going to hire to manage the funds that you had, like the prime cap and such.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.440]   What I read in your book, which is the first place I think I've read it before, was you
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:34.320]   actually had laid out here a system that you used for determining which active managers
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.840]   that you were going to hire.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   Yeah, it was actually less of a system, and maybe a series of checkpoints.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:47.160]   I don't mean to belabor that, but it wasn't as if we did ratings all up and down those
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:52.120]   numbers and gave managers scores from 1 to 10.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.320]   We looked at the way they made the basic performance standard, performance being the last thing
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.420]   we looked at, but we looked at philosophy, we looked at people.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.000]   Without those kind of things, we looked at the portfolio to make sure it carried them
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.480]   out, and then finally, we looked at the performance.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:18.560]   Performance is so deceptive because it doesn't repeat, and it's cost investors I'm sure hundreds
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:23.120]   of billions of dollars who just jumping back and forth from a fund because they think they
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:29.760]   buy it for the performance, and then they don't get the performance, so they sell it.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:35.140]   There's no better example, and I don't mean to be catty, than Magellan Fund, who did very
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:41.200]   well for quite a number of years and got to be at $110 billion and had never done well
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.480]   since and is now about $11 billion in assets.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.160]   It's a loss of $100 billion.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.600]   Investors have withdrawn or the market has taken away.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:59.740]   >> In 1996, when you turned over CEO, what percentage of the assets at Vanguard were
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.660]   index funds and what percentage was active?
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   Do you recall?
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.660]   >> Sure.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   We were 31% index.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.660]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:14.340]   So, you had really jumped even over a five-year period of time, say 1991 to 1996.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:21.860]   I have a little bit in the book about momentum, and that index momentum, you know, we went
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:33.260]   from, let's say, 10% in 1990, so let's say 7% in 1989 to 50% in 1999, so the growth rate
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:39.620]   has really slowed down, believe it or not, to 75%, 78% in 2018.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:47.900]   In other words, it went up five times, I guess that's right, and after that, it's going up
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.900]   about 50%.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:57.740]   >> By 1996, all the pieces were in place for the huge growth of indexing and traditional
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:03.740]   index funds, and that has been the area that has really taken off at Vanguard, and most
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:09.780]   of the assets have gone into those traditional index funds that you created in 1996 or prior,
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:15.980]   or they were on the board at least by 1996, and that really is what Vanguard indexing
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:20.800]   is about, is those core funds, the ones that you had created.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:26.740]   But for the last 22 years, you've been very influential in the industry and very much
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:32.220]   a part of the industry and educating investors, and not only educating investors, but also
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:38.020]   trying to educate the industry and educate regulators on where the industry needs to
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.700]   go.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:44.880]   And part three of your book is all about the future of investment management, where you
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:54.260]   look at where we are now and give your views, basically three ideas, of where the company
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.380]   is going or should go in the future.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:03.900]   And the very first one that you talk about is the mutualization of major firms.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:11.380]   And what I read about this is that you believe that other major mutual fund companies eventually
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:17.380]   must mutualize, like Vanguard started out doing, if they're going to survive.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.380]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   Well, it's pretty easy to elaborate on, and that is the difference between a mutual
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:31.100]   company and a traditional company outside external manager is that the mutual company
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:35.220]   basically gives all those huge management company profits that they would otherwise
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.740]   earn back to the shareholders, and the external manager does not.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:45.940]   This is a particular problem when the external manager is a subsidiary of a big conglomerate,
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:51.180]   because the big conglomerate buys the mutual company, this is the way corporations work.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:56.180]   They buy the mutual company and they want a 15% return or a 20% return on their capital,
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.860]   and if they don't get it, they will hire somebody who will get it.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:06.700]   That's the business, to make money by getting into it on the ground floor of an industry.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:14.300]   So in my book I think I point out that of the 50 largest mutual fund companies, 40 of
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:22.060]   them, maybe 41, are externally managed by financial conglomerates.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:27.580]   They're publicly held, I'm sorry I misstated that, they're publicly held about half by
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:34.900]   financial conglomerates and half by public investors, and those investors want money.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.380]   They want growth.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   They want dividends.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:42.780]   These are the shareholders of the management company, so it's a direct conflict of interest,
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:49.820]   and that is the one major reason why mutual funds don't outperform the market indexes.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.700]   There are a whole lot of other reasons, but that comes right in there.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:59.780]   So how are you going to get your fees, I mean if you got your fees so low that you made
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.620]   no money, I don't know what your owner would say.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:10.340]   So they can't compete on cost, and people have started to realize that cost is almost
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.220]   everything.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.300]   Cost comes and goes.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:21.340]   Costs go on forever, and if people accompany their interest in cost, we're seeing what
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:28.580]   a tremendous burden it is over the long term, and I think I have data in the book that shows
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:37.420]   that if the market yields 7%, you end up over 25 years, I guess, with $30 for each dollar
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:43.980]   invested initially, then maybe 50 years, let's say 50 years, $30 for a dollar, and if you
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.300]   get 5%, a dollar grows to $10.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:54.900]   That means 2/3 of your long term return has been consumed by cost.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:01.180]   It makes no sense, and as people get aware of that, they're going to have to get their
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:07.180]   cost down, as their clients get aware of it, and when the clients wake up, the industry
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.180]   will wake up.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:12.260]   I see somewhere in your book, you wrote, you came up with the number of how much money
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:19.540]   Vanguard has saved investors, and it was somewhere in the order of $217 billion is what you estimated
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:25.580]   Vanguard has saved investors because of the continued pressure of pushing down fees.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.100]   So you have a lot of data in there about that, and there was one thing, too, I want to point
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:35.140]   out about what you just said about the cost, is that it's always been my belief that costs
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.940]   matter, that's been your mantra, costs matter.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.460]   You're taking my motto.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:42.780]   No, that's your motto, that's what I'm saying, it's not mine, it's yours.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.780]   Costs matter.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:50.100]   The reason why index funds outperform most active management, the bottom line is cost.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:55.260]   It's not because we have dumb managers out there, because in aggregate, all the managers
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:01.060]   put together are the market, so we're just talking about cost, correct?
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.220]   For cost, the average manager is average.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:09.460]   I'm talking about if the market's total return is 7%, all the investors in the market earn
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.780]   gross 7%.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:19.420]   Now this is not nuclear science, this is not brain surgery, this is the relentless rules
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.780]   of humble arithmetic.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:30.740]   As William Sharpe said, your last argument is about the antiquated laws, the legislation
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:35.440]   that we have from the Investment Company Act of 1940.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.340]   You say that there needs to be a complete rewrite of the Investment Company Act, which
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:47.140]   is the law that governs mutual fund companies and investment companies, and you talk about
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:57.180]   the Financial Institutions Act of 2030 to replace the Investment Company Act of 1940.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:01.780]   You make the argument that that Act of 1940 existed when there was only a few companies
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:07.560]   around and they all looked a lot like Wellington, if you will, with one fund, and it spent too
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.900]   many patches and the whole thing needs to be redone.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.100]   Well that's right.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:19.300]   It was also, if you read the Act with Care, which I did a long, long, long time ago, the
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:26.300]   reality is it was written mainly to curb the abuses of closed-end companies, which sprang
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:31.140]   up in the late 1920s and vanished in the 1930s.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.620]   So it was a closed-end company act by and large.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.140]   It also regulates funds.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:45.320]   Each fund, no fund, for example, can own more than 10% of the voting stock of any security.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.740]   Where today we don't have a mutual fund industry as such, we have a mutual fund complex industry.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.900]   So if each fund can only have 10%, does that mean if you have 20 funds you can have 200%?
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.780]   I don't think so.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:04.980]   One of the areas that to me has really helped propel your message and your vision has been
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.180]   social media.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:14.380]   The Bogleheads, for example, which was originally established on the Morningstar Forum and then
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:22.220]   we moved off to a separate independent website called bogleheads.org, has done, I think,
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:30.500]   just a tremendous job of helping to spread your message and low fees, fees matter, and
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:35.340]   all of the good investment ideas that you have been putting out there for many, many,
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.340]   many years.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:44.340]   I see social media as helping to really expand the knowledge of the individual investor out
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:50.080]   there and really has helped people to understand and embrace the concept, to have that epiphany
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.100]   or that aha moment about why index funds work.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.700]   You've never really talked about getting the word out and I haven't read anywhere where
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.740]   you've really gotten to your comments about social media and how it might have helped
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.920]   you and helped Vanguard grow.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.900]   Can you comment on that?
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.940]   Sure.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.260]   I have not written a lot about social media generally, but I have written including a
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:18.540]   couple of forwards about a particular social media called the Bogleheads and they have
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:26.260]   been an enormous asset to Vanguard, a staggeringly large asset and not only do they get heard
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:32.340]   when they have a complaint and a complaint from them is as good as gold.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:37.060]   If we get a complaint from someone that we know, it turns out we'll see how many people
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.880]   are affected by it, how many shareholders, and fix it.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.620]   You want people who criticize you up to a point and the Bogleheads have not only helped
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:52.260]   one another, as everybody knows, I mean it's been a fantastic website with participation
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:58.940]   that's beyond belief, I think by far the most popular financial website that's out there,
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:04.580]   but it's independent, it has nothing to do with us, they have nothing to sell, but good
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.900]   grace and good advice.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:15.180]   So the Bogleheads stand alone in being a huge asset to Vanguard and a huge asset to indexing.
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:19.700]   I should add without taking anything away from the Bogleheads at all, another great
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:27.820]   source of our strength is academia, few business school courses in investment do not talk the
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:36.540]   index as book, if you will, the Bogle message, it's academic community, Andy Lowe at MIT,
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:44.780]   Bill Sharpe, Bert Malkiel at Princeton, they're all there and he's not quite an academic,
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:53.300]   but David Swenson at Yale, the money managers of the colleges which are very much indexing,
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.660]   so it's not just the man on the street, if you will, or woman on the street, the Bogleheads
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:06.180]   worthy of help and worthy of honor, but it's the man off the street in the ivory tower
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:17.940]   of education, financial education and sophisticated concepts that have also been a great asset.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:22.440]   Rest assured that the Bogleheads will ensure that you have a legacy.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:28.500]   With that, we thank you very, very much for everything that you've done for the industry,
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:34.980]   everything you've done for millions of investors in the U.S. and internationally, and your
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:40.340]   work will go on for many, many years after all of us are gone.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.380]   So thank you for this interview, we greatly appreciate it.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.380]   Thank you, Rick.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.980]   Good to talk to you, and good luck to the Bogleheads.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:55.380]   This concludes the first episode of Bogleheads on Investing.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.220]   Join us each month as we have a new special guest.
