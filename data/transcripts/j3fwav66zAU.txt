[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.160]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 6. And let me read the first four verses.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.920]   The first four verses in the sixth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.760]   And in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.880]   the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.600]   Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said, "It is not reason
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.280]   that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.920]   you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.960]   over this business. But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.480]   of the word." Now I want this evening to deal particularly with that fourth verse.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.360]   But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word. Those
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.120]   who attend here regularly will know that we are examining this chapter and this first
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.880]   part of the chapter in particular for the fourth Sunday evening. And we have come to
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.160]   it because we are working our way slowly through these early chapters of the book of the Acts
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.920]   of the Apostles and have been doing so for some eighteen months or so. We've been working
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.560]   our way and we've come to this particular statement.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   Now we are doing this of course in order that we may discover exactly what Christianity
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.000]   is, what the Church is, what her business is, what her message is. And we are doing
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.640]   this because of the state of the world. The world is bankrupt. It's tried everything,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   but nothing avails it. Here is the only hope for this world. This is this Christian message,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.960]   the message that the Church has been presenting to the world when she has been truly functioning
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.640]   as the Church from her very foundation and origin. This is the only thing that can avail.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.800]   But the tragedy is that there is such terrible confusion with regard to all this, as to what
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.640]   the Church is, as to what regards what her message is and how she should deliver it and
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.480]   so on. That's our reason for doing all this. The times are desperate. The times are cruel.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.080]   And it is our business to make certain of these things.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.280]   Well now here, at this particular point in the story of the early Church, we find the
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.520]   Church facing a very crucial decision. It arose, as you see, because of some dispute
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.680]   between the Greek-speaking Jews who had become Christians and the Hebrew-speaking Jews who
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.000]   had become Christians. They'd shared their goods, we had told earlier on, and there were
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.760]   widows and people without means of livelihood and of support, and as Christians they felt
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.280]   that they should be helping such people. But apparently the Greeks felt that their widows
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.320]   were being neglected. And so this dispute arose and they brought it to the apostles,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.440]   obviously with the suggestion that the apostles should give themselves to this question. The
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.840]   number of the disciples, we are told, had multiplied greatly, and it was obviously a
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.600]   whole time task if the apostles had decided to undertake it. But we are told here that
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.840]   the apostles, led by the Spirit of God, came to a most vital and important decision. And
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.200]   it's put in that second verse. "It is not reason that we should leave the Word of God
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.320]   and serve tables." The Church is not a political nor a social institution. There are others
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.520]   who can do that. That's not to condemn such work. That work is all right. It is good work
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.600]   to relieve widows, but it is not the primary task of the Church. The primary task of the
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.840]   Church is to minister this Word, to preach this Gospel. Now, the apostles were led to
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.000]   see that, and they acted on it. And the Church was saved as the result of their action. This
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.960]   is the primary task of the Church. Not to make people more comfortable, not to give
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.920]   them money, not to give them food, or many other things. The Church has done all this
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.520]   and it's a part of her work, but it's not the primary task of the Church. The primary
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   task of the Church is to preach this Word, this Gospel, and we give the reasons for that,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.440]   why that has always been and must always be the primary task of the Church. The souls
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.600]   of men are more important than their bodies. What should it profit a man though he gain
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.120]   the whole world and lose his own soul? And here is the only message in the universe tonight
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.040]   that can deal with the souls of men. It must have priority in the Church over everything
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.680]   else. Then that has led us on, of course, to consider the nature of this Word, the content,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.920]   if you like, of the message. It is the Word of God, not the words of men. It is a definite
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.120]   and a definable Word. There's no difficulty in discovering what it is if you believe the
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.200]   New Testament and regard it as your authority. And we have also been considering what indeed
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:40.600]   is the message. It is about God and what God has done about us men and our salvation. That's
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.960]   what it's about. This is the only message that starts with God. The cults and all similar
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.440]   messages start with men and his need. This starts with the glory of God and tells us
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:01.320]   about God's great scheme and plan of redemption, which he had worked out in his eternal mind
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.960]   and counsel even before the very foundation of the world. And we have seen that it centers
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:16.520]   particularly in Jesus Christ and him crucified. God hath made him as God has exalted him with
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.680]   his right hand to be a prince and a savior, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:32.520]   of sins. Jesus Christ and him crucified is the heart and center of the message. And the
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   decision the apostles came to was this, that they were going to give themselves to this.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.440]   Not even looking after the needs of widows, there's no more deserving cause than that.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:52.240]   But even that must take primary position or usurp this function. We will give ourselves
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.480]   to the ministry of the word. And we've seen the importance of our knowing exactly what
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.880]   that word is. But tonight I want to emphasize this other thing that they say. We will give
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:16.480]   ourselves continually to prayer, to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. Now why do
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.360]   they put this in also, and why indeed do they put it before the ministry of the word? I've
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.560]   deliberately taken them in the other order because I want to emphasize this. Sometimes
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.800]   that's the best way of emphasizing something. Prayer and the ministry of the word. Why did
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   they do this? Why do they give such prominence to this whole matter of prayer? Well now here
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.440]   again we come across an aspect of this whole matter that is of the most extreme and vital
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.400]   importance for us. As we look at it we shall be reminded further of the character of the
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.600]   word, of the message, of the gospel itself. And at the same time we shall be reminded
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.280]   of something that is equally important, namely how it is to be preached and how it is to
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:12.480]   be presented. Now I say that this is a very vital matter for us. The message must always
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.840]   be right. If the message isn't true, nothing else is of any value. We must be orthodox.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   We must know what the gospel is. A church which doesn't know what the gospel is, is
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:31.480]   a travesty, she's not a church. We must be orthodox. We must know exactly what the message
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.960]   is. But the thing that is emphasized here this evening is this, that while orthodoxy
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:48.000]   is absolutely essential, even orthodoxy is not sufficient. Even orthodoxy alone is not
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.120]   enough. Even orthodoxy cannot do the work if it is left in isolation. We will give ourselves
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:08.720]   continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word. This gospel cannot be preached
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.760]   properly and truly except it be in an atmosphere of prayer.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.360]   Well now this is something I say again that is of the most urgent importance for us at
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.680]   the present time. This is misunderstood as much probably as any other aspect of the work
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.040]   of the church and the preaching of the gospel. How is it misunderstood today? Well let me
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   put it to you. We are hearing a great deal and have been now for some time about what
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.480]   is called the problem of communication. What does that mean? Well what they mean by that
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.080]   is they say well here's the message that the world needs, but the problem is how can you
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:54.160]   get it over? How can you get people to listen to it? How can you get people to accept it?
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.880]   Problem of communication, new title but an old problem isn't it? You see there's nothing
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.680]   new about this. This has always been a problem throughout the whole history of the Christian
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.440]   church. But we are told that today it is the problem of problems. Why? Well the answer
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:16.400]   that's given is because of the new conditions in which we find ourselves. We are told that
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.480]   we are confronted by a situation such as the church has never known before. Why? Well because
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:31.000]   we are living in this atomic age, this scientific age, which makes all previous ages well look
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.280]   rather childish and immature. Man has been so ignorant in the past but now you see we've
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.960]   been able to conquer the force of gravity, split the atom, release these tremendous powers.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.600]   Man, science particularly, is so developed and advanced that we are told that there is
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.280]   an entirely new situation confronting the church. That man is no longer what he has
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.840]   been. We are told that in the past men believed in some sort of three-tier universe, but that
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   the modern scientific man can't possibly believe in that. He cannot believe in the supernatural
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.240]   and the miraculous. He knows that in the past so many things were regarded as miraculous
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.720]   which he can now explain quite easily. So that the whole category of the supernatural
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.600]   and the miraculous has just gone out. And we are told that if you were to appeal to
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.240]   the modern man, well you've just got to stop talking in those categories. That's
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:30.960]   what we are being told. This new situation as the result of our new knowledge, and especially
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.560]   scientific knowledge, has changed the whole position so that the church today is confronted
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:47.080]   by an entirely new problem of communication. Now, there are two main reactions to that
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:54.200]   kind of thinking, or two ways, and I'm going to put the two extremes before you.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.960]   There are many in between them. But there are two main teachings and emphases in the
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.440]   church today as to how this new situation is to be dealt with. You see what we are being
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.600]   told is this. Let me put it still more simply. We are told we are in this post-war world.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.960]   We are in a world in which the old categories no longer count. That's why you see they
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.200]   agitated and got so excited a few years back about a new translation of the Bible that's
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.520]   called the New English Bible. At last they said, we've got a Bible that the people
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.800]   can understand. Tom, Dick and Harry, these poor boys who don't understand about justification,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.960]   sanctification and glorification, they've got it now in a language they can understand
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.120]   and they're now going to believe it. This is it. This is the thing that's needed.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.200]   Problem of communication. Bringing over the truth to people who are ignorant of our very
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   phraseology and terminology. How do we react to this? Two main reactions, I say. The first
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:59.080]   is this. It's a very well-known one and well-advertised one in this country. These
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.880]   seem to be the people of which the controllers of the various television corporations are
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.800]   most enamored. These are the people who say that you must approach this situation now
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.240]   in a more intelligent manner. You must approach it along the lines of the mind.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:23.160]   You're familiar with some of the notorious books that have been published in the last
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.240]   few years that have been attempting to do this honest to God, down to earth and
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.640]   all various others. I was reading one of them, I quoted him fortnight tonight,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.920]   in this category, who says that the modern man has got certain built-in convictions,
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.520]   which are always scientific, of course, and if you don't recognize them and if you just come to him
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.400]   and preach the Bible, you'll make no contact with him and your evangelism will be a complete and an
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:56.680]   entire failure. They say that the modern man has got to be approached along the lines of the mind
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:03.160]   and the understanding. Now this is not new again. This whole tendency in the church has been going
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.720]   on for over a century. There was a great change that took place, you know, about the middle of
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:14.600]   the last century. A great change in the church herself. The church which had felt the power and
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.920]   the fervor and the zeal of the evangelical awakening of the 18th century began to say,
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.720]   "Well now, of course, men are being educated and you mustn't preach to them in that old way. You
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.520]   must have men who are cultured and who can speak to them in a cultured manner." So they put more
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.040]   and more emphasis upon what? Well, not upon whether the preacher was filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.600]   but whether he was filled with a knowledge of philosophy and of learning and of science,
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.720]   so that he could speak to men on their own level and reason with them and argue with them in terms
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.480]   that they could follow and comprehend and which were acceptable to them. So more and more,
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.520]   the church has said, "What you need as preachers is men who've been well trained in philosophy and
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.040]   psychology." Psychology has become increasingly important, an understanding of how man's mind
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.160]   works and so on. "And you must also give them a knowledge of sociology and all these various
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.360]   other matters. And so they'll be able to speak to men in his own jargon and the modern men will
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.560]   listen. This is the way to evangelize him and to get at him." Some of them have gone so far as to
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:24.520]   say that you need a new message. That obviously this book which we call the Bible is a dated book,
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.360]   that it's written in the jargon and the terminology of its own age, the pre-scientific era,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.200]   and that therefore you've got to modify this drastically if there is to be any hope for the
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:43.080]   modern men to listen to it, leave alone to believe it. Now there's one reaction which says,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.280]   "Cultivate the mind, approach them directly in terms of mind and thought and reason and logic
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.840]   and understanding." But you know there is the exact opposite reaction also, and I want to hold
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:03.720]   that before you. Because side by side with this intellectual emphasis and approach on the one
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   hand, there is the other which is almost as I say the exact opposite, which says, "Don't be
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.800]   interested in the mind, that doesn't matter, it's the heart that matters." Or some say, "It is the
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:22.600]   will that matters." So put your emphasis upon the heart and the will. In any case, the argument is
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.720]   you've got to meet people as they are. Well now let me give you a very perfect example of this
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:35.080]   kind of thing I'm calling. It may be an extreme example, but it covers everything that thinks and
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:41.320]   argues in this way. Now this is a newspaper cutting which I have here about a program that
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:48.680]   was shown for the first time last Sunday evening at 6.35 p.m. on the independent television network.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:57.720]   This is what I read, "Identicate pictures of God and the devil are to be shown in a new type of
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:05.480]   religious program, Heavens Above, over the whole independent television network on Sunday at 6.35.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:13.080]   The pictures were drawn with others of heaven and hell by Peter Cocker from descriptions by
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:22.280]   youths and girls of how in childhood they imagined God and the devil. One girl described God as,
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:30.040]   quote, "Rather a cross between Father Christmas and my mother, a sort of friendly jovial character
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:36.760]   with massive great hands." End of quotation. The program produced by Southern Television
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:43.960]   and introduced by Kenneth Horn, the comedian, is described as an almost revolutionary breakaway
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:52.840]   approach to, note, religious broadcasting. This is religious broadcasting. George Egan, the director,
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:01.000]   said yesterday, quote, "We are really producing a 25-minute religious variety show with comedy
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:13.160]   and musical and novelty spots." Now, there you see is another approach. Now let's be fair,
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.520]   these people are quite honest. These people are perfectly sincere.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:25.480]   They say that they're anxious to get the message over to men and women, over to boys and girls.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.560]   That it's no use preaching in the old way out of the Bible and expounding doctrine. They can't
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   understand it. They can't follow it. You've got to come down to their level. You've got to give
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.200]   them something they do know and understand and can appreciate. You've got to bring in, you see,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.720]   this element of entertainment. And here is the term. It's a very interesting term to me. "We are
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:55.480]   really producing a 25-minute religious variety show with comedy and musical and novelty spots."
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:02.040]   One item comes on, goes back. The other item comes on. A religious variety show. A religious
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   entertainment. Here it is in its blatant and extreme form. But I say that I'm anxious to deal
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.920]   with the principle behind that, which always doesn't do it in such a blatant form,
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:21.080]   but which rarely uses always the same reasoning, the same argument. That you've got to deal with
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.560]   people as they are. And you've got to come down to their level in order to interest them and to
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.520]   attract them and to entice them. Let me say again, I'm not concerned about the honesty of these
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:40.280]   people. I'll grant them full honesty and sincerity. But what I am here to do is to just do this.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:48.200]   To show you that it is a complete and an entire departure from the method of the apostles.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:55.960]   A complete departure from it. And my dear friends, until we come back to this apostolic
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.440]   method and pattern, there is literally no hope. Of course you can do things with your other method,
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:09.720]   but the question is, are they the work of the Spirit of God? Look at these apostles. How do
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.560]   they approach their problem? They have exactly the same problem. This is their answer. We will
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:28.960]   give ourselves continually to prayer. Prayer. And to the ministry of the word. Not your variety show,
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.640]   not your entertainment. Not wheedling to the people, not pandering, not descending, not reducing.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:41.560]   We will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word. Now here's the
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:49.320]   question. Why did they do this? Why do they emphasize the all-importance of prayer? Why did
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:55.960]   these people pray continuously? Well the answers are here before us. We've already come across them
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.600]   in the earlier chapters. Let's look at these great principles again. Is there anything that is more
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:08.680]   urgently needed than this at this very moment? Every time there has been a revival of religion,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:16.200]   men have returned to this apostolic method and pattern. It is God's own way and there is no other.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.920]   Why do they put this emphasis on prayer? One, the first answer is,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.960]   because of their realization of their own impotence and their absolute need of the power
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:37.000]   of God. Let me remind you again, the Sanhedrin, you remember, described these men accurately in
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.360]   these terms. They said they are unlearned and ignorant men. And they were. They had no knowledge,
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.280]   they had no understanding, they had no innate powers, and if they'd exerted them to the maximum
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.400]   they'd have been quite useless. And they knew that. They knew that there was only one hope,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.960]   and that was that they were filled with the power of God. So they give themselves continually to
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   prayer. These are the men, remember, who'd been filled on the day of Pentecost with the Holy
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.440]   Ghost. They'd been baptized with the Holy Ghost. They'd been filled till they were overflowing.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.840]   They'd had a similar filling then as it is described in the fourth chapter, when they
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.480]   were praying together in that upper room and the very building was shaken, filled again with the
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.640]   Spirit. But this is the interesting thing, that these men so filled with the Spirit find prayer
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:32.200]   an absolute imperative, an utter necessity. And they give themselves continually to prayer and
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.840]   to the ministry of the world. And we've already seen how at every crisis this is exactly what
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:43.560]   they do. You remember when Peter and John had been arrested? And they'd been set at liberty
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.960]   for the time being, but they'd been threatened very plainly and very clearly that if they went
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.280]   on preaching and teaching in the name of this Jesus, they'd not only be arrested again, they'd
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.880]   be put to death. What did they do? We told, being let go, they went to their own company and reported
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.960]   all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. And when they heard that, what did
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.480]   they do? Did they have a conference? Did they say, "How shall we change our methods? We seem to have
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.240]   been failing. We're not so successful. We've been too blunt. We've been too direct. Let's start
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.880]   again. Let's modify our methods. Let's go more slowly. Let's use diplomacy." Nonsense. When they
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:25.080]   heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, "They prayed." The first thing
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.360]   they did all of us was to pray. Indeed, we've already been told about these people. In the
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.400]   second chapter, they continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching of doctrine and fellowship,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:42.680]   and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. People filled with the Spirit. And prayer is absolutely
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:48.840]   essential. Why? Well, because, you see, you're not given the Holy Spirit in one kind of block
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:56.120]   installment and never anymore. No, no. You constantly need to keep in touch. You constantly
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.880]   need to be in attitude and condition of prayer. You constantly need to be receiving fresh supplies.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.960]   And these men, they knew that. They saw the problem confronting them. And they realized that
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.800]   they needed more knowledge and understanding of the gospel and the truth that had been committed
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.080]   to them. Here they are, these ignorant and unlettered men. Suddenly they're sent out with
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.120]   this great commission. And they know that they're inadequate. They say, "Oh God, teach us and give
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.320]   us understanding. Enlighten the eyes of our understanding. Open. Give us the Spirit. Give
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.360]   us the unction, this blessed unction and anointing that will make the Word plain and clear to us.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.760]   We don't understand and we don't want to go wrong. Lord, give it us." So they prayed. They needed
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:48.280]   understanding, so they asked for it. They needed power to preach. They were not trained orators.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:55.560]   They were not rhetoricians like the Greek philosophers and others. Simple men, fishermen,
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.840]   artisans and others. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not condemning teaching of knowledge or culture.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.520]   That's not what I'm doing. What I'm condemning is reliance upon it. Putting your faith in it or in
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.160]   any other of your expedients. I don't care what they are. Whether they're this knowledge and
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.760]   culture on the one hand or whether it's this new variety religious program, whatever it calls
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.400]   itself, on the other. Putting faith in these methods of men. That's the thing I'm condemning.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.920]   The apostles didn't do that. Their faith was in the living God. And that is why they prayed.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:33.240]   And they needed power to preach. And they needed authority. Now, I needn't keep you with this. Let
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:41.880]   me take you to the great and most perfect example and illustration of it all. I read it to you at
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:50.760]   the beginning. Look at this mighty man, the apostle Paul. Here's a man of ability. Here's a
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:58.440]   man of knowledge. Here's a man of culture. Here's one of the great geniuses of all the centuries.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.560]   Did you notice what he said about himself and his condition when he went to preach in Corinth?
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:15.080]   "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." What? The apostle Paul?
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.000]   He didn't bounce into the pulpit or onto a platform in supreme self-control.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.560]   Weakness, fear, much trembling. How do you explain this? What is this? Oh,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:36.360]   there's no difficulty about the explanation. This colossus, this mighty genius,
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.960]   was aware of the terrible responsibility that rested upon him.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.360]   That's why he was conscious of weakness. That's why he was fearful. That is why he was trembling.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.040]   What is it? Oh, it's the responsibility of standing between God and men.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:27:03.240]   It's the responsibility of realizing that these are never-dying souls that may be going to an
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:09.400]   eternity of misery. Oh, a man who realizes that can't be light and trivial and jocular.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:16.040]   He's a man who's filled with a sense of inadequacy, of weakness, fear, much trembling.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:21.000]   What a desperately serious thing it is. What did you think of a surgeon who came to you when you're
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.480]   desperately ill and was advising you in operation and who cracked jokes about it? The thing is
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:32.040]   unthinkable. No surgeon would dream of doing such a thing. But here is a man dealing with the souls
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.440]   of men and women. It's not a question of a temporary improvement or of life for just another
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:42.600]   few years. It's everlasting and eternal destiny. And he is in this middle position between them.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:49.320]   He's overwhelmed by the thought of it. He was afraid of misrepresenting the message,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:57.400]   afraid of standing between people and the truth, afraid of being a hindrance to these souls.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:03.640]   The apostle keeps on saying this sort of thing. He says it perhaps still more plainly in the second
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.760]   epistle to the Corinthians and in the second chapter. Here's a description of the preacher,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.120]   you see. And that's why the apostle was with weakness, fear, and much trembling. He says,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:20.360]   "No, thanks be unto God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ and make it manifest the
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:27.880]   savour of his knowledge by us in every place." Listen, "We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:36.520]   in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death,
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:42.040]   and to the other the savour of life unto life." And he asks his question,
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:50.600]   "Who is sufficient for these things?" My dear friends, have you ever known what it is to be
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:58.040]   conscious that you're in the presence of the living God? And we are in his presence this evening.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.920]   This is a religious service. It isn't made sacred by the building. It's the same if you're in the
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.880]   open air or anywhere else. It isn't buildings that determine your form of worship. There are people,
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   you know, who in certain circumstances and with stained glass windows, insist upon a certain type
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.400]   of service, put the same people in another kind of building, and they behave entirely differently.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.920]   They are not governed by the presence of God. They are governed by buildings.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:30.680]   Who is sufficient for these things? We are in the presence of the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:37.240]   He is looking down upon us, and our whole eternal future is here. It's being decided by our reaction
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:43.880]   to this gospel. Now that was the thing that made the apostle feel this fear and weakness,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:50.280]   and he was literally trembling. He was terrified, he tells us in that second chapter of 1 Corinthians,
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.880]   that the people might believe in him and not in his gospel. He says that your faith might not
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:02.040]   stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. He deliberately eschews all this. He says
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.480]   in the next chapter that he's become a fool for Christ's sake. He doesn't care what they think
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.040]   about him. He's made himself a fool. He's determined not to know anything among them,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.160]   save Jesus Christ and him crucified, and he's not going to use any expedience or methods or
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.840]   anything. He relies upon the Spirit of the living God, that your faith may not stand in the wisdom
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:30.520]   of men, but in the power of God, and that the glory might be his and might be his alone.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.320]   That's why these men gave themselves continually to prayer.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.560]   They needed this power, they needed this authority, they needed this unction,
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:49.320]   they needed this which alone can demonstrate God and his glory and his eternity and his
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:55.560]   mighty power unto salvation. Nothing else could bring to men and women such a realization.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:04.200]   And so they gave themselves continually to prayer, to waiting upon him, to pleading for this unction
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:10.360]   and authority and power. And this has been the characteristic of all men whom God has used so
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.920]   signally and mightily throughout the running ages. Do you remember the story of Robert Murray
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:22.040]   MacChain, that saintly Scottish preacher of the 1840s? We are told this about him, that very often
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.720]   on Sunday mornings when he entered his pulpit, the moment he entered, people began to weep
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:35.320]   at the mere sight of him. Why? Oh, he'd come from the presence of God, and there was something of
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.040]   the radiance of God upon his very face, his whole department, everything about the men.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:47.640]   Oh, the seriousness, the solemnity, the majesty of it all, an emissary from God, an ambassador
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.160]   of Christ, he's come from the presence, and he carries it with him. And men and women knew
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:59.560]   that they were face to face with the living God, and not mere men. Demonstration of the spirit and
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:10.920]   of power that is only obtained in prayer, and in continual prayer. Well, there's one reason.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:19.240]   Let's move on to a second reason. They gave themselves to prayer and the desire for this
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:28.600]   power because they realized the state and the condition of all mankind by nature.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:37.480]   In other words, they had a true understanding of the problem of evangelism, the task of evangelism,
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   or if you like your modern jargon, the problem of communication. Here's the gospel,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:49.320]   there's mankind. What is the problem? Is it the problem of the 20th century? No, no.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:55.720]   Is it the problem of new knowledge, science, learning, philosophy? No, no. The problem
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.880]   doesn't change, it's always been there. It was as difficult to preach the gospel in the first century
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.440]   as it is in the 20th century. It's no more difficult now than it was then. It's never
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:12.040]   been an easy thing to preach this gospel. Why not? Well, here's the answer. And that is where all
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.320]   these modifications of message and of method are a denial ultimately of the nature of the gospel.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:27.000]   The pathetic program on the wireless, religious variety show, one after another,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:38.200]   one singing, one doing this, variety show, man's wisdom. No, no. These men gave themselves
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:44.680]   continually to prayer because they knew the problem of evangelism and of communication.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.320]   What is it? Well, there are many ways in which this can be put. Here is one thing.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.560]   They realized, as the apostle Paul has again put it authoritatively and finally once and for all,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:02.760]   we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Our problem is not human nature even.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.920]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.800]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.920]   or in heavenly places. That's the problem. We are fighting not men, we are fighting the devil.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.080]   We are fighting hell. We are fighting spiritual forces second only to the power of God himself.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.960]   We are fighting a power that has defeated every man, defeated even Adam in a state of perfection,
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.280]   defeated all the patriarchs and all the prophets and the psalmists. He's defeated them all. He's
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.560]   got them all down. Who are these ignorant and unlettered men? Though they've got a new message,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.200]   as it were, who are they to deal with such powers? It's impossible. It can't be done.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:57.960]   You need a divine power to meet devilish power. And all your cleverness, whether it's manifested
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:04.520]   in the realm of the mind or on the heart of the will, it's of no value. It's inadequate.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:10.280]   But not only are you fighting these powers that are at the back of the problem, you are dealing
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:17.160]   with mankind as the result of the nefarious influences of these terrible powers. Now again,
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:23.320]   let me, in order to hurry on, give you a description of what mankind is like by nature,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   as the result of the fall, as the result of sin, as against men, as the result of man's original
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:35.720]   rebellion against God. Here is the result. Listen. "This I say, therefore," says Paul in Ephesians 4,
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:43.880]   17, "and testify in the Lord, that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk," listen,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:50.760]   "in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:57.000]   the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.560]   who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:10.440]   greediness." That was Paul's description of the Gentile world in the first century. And it is a
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:18.040]   most perfect description of London this night, June the 26th, 1966. There is no difference
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.920]   whatsoever. Don't talk to me about splitting the atom and all these other marvelous, wonderful
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:29.400]   things that I'm aware of as well as you are. Here is mankind. This is the problem. Mind darkened.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:38.360]   Understanding darkened. Being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them,
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.560]   because of the blindness of their heart, who being past feeling have given themselves over
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:50.280]   unto lasciviousness, to walk all uncleanness with greediness. You read the second half of the first
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.760]   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and there you'll get an account of life as it's being lived
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:00.120]   in London tonight, and New York, and Washington, perhaps America even worse than this country.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:07.800]   Here it is, man the slave of devil and of hell, sin and lasciviousness, sexual immorality,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:14.040]   sexual perversions, the whole gamut of it. It's all described there perfectly. The world is exactly
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:23.400]   what it's always been. There is the problem of evangelism. Man is dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:32.120]   The natural mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:38.760]   The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. They were saying that a thousand years before
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:45.000]   Christ was born, Psalm 14 1, the fool hath said in his heart there is no God. And modern men thinks
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.440]   he's clever when he says the same thing. Hallmark of modernity, oh how old-fashioned unbelief is.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:56.040]   Blind, ignorant, spiritually dead, haters of God denying him.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:05.000]   And the gospel, what is it? Well, Paul has told us, the natural man receiveth not the things of
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.200]   the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him. Rubbish, nonsense. They said that in the
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.360]   first century. They're still saying it. There's nothing new. It isn't because of new knowledge
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.320]   that they're saying the gospel is foolishness. The natural man has always said it. He does not
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.600]   believe in God. He doesn't believe in Christ as the Son of God. He doesn't believe in two natures
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.640]   in one person. It's utterly unreasonable to him. He rejects the miraculous and the supernatural.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.120]   He's always done it. There's nothing new in this.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:42.520]   So you see, these men realized that no argument or demonstration could persuade people.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:51.880]   If this gospel can be reasoned, if a man can be reasoned to salvation, well why is it that all
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:58.680]   reasonable and learned men have not been reasoned to salvation? But it can't be done. It isn't so.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.920]   What's the value of reason in these matters? There's a great question. I suppose in many
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.720]   ways it is the most urgent and acute problem of all at the present time. What is the place
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:17.080]   and the value of reason in this realm and with these things? And there is no difficulty about
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:23.480]   discovering the answer in the Bible. It is this. The value of reason at its best is only general.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:29.320]   It has its value, but it's mainly negative and it's mainly
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.240]   condemnatory. Paul again has put this so perfectly in Romans 1. He puts it like this.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:43.560]   "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.200]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.960]   the things that are made, even his eternal power unguarded, so that they are without excuse."
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:02.520]   That's it. They're without excuse. "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.200]   neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened,
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:14.760]   professing themselves to be wise." Still doing it. "They became fools and changed the glory of the
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.680]   uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible men and to birds and four-footed
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:28.600]   beasts and creeping things." What all that means is this. The evidence of God is round and about
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:37.320]   us in nature and creation. And man is without an excuse. Reason can bring us to that. Reason
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.880]   is of value as far as it goes, but the tragedy is that it can never go far enough. It can show us
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:51.000]   the wrongness of not believing in God. It can show us the futility of trusting to men and his wisdom
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.680]   and his understanding. The modern world is showing us all this. It can show us the reasonableness of
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:04.520]   believing the gospel, but it can't persuade us. You can demonstrate this to a man. You can show
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.080]   it him, the reasonableness of it all, the unreasonableness of unbelief, but you don't touch
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.120]   him. You leave him exactly where he is. Why? Well, our Lord has given the answer to that.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:29.080]   This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, that men loved darkness rather than
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:37.400]   light because their deeds were evil. And they love darkness. The light has come, more than
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.920]   sufficient, but they won't have it. They reject it. Why? They love darkness rather than light
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:49.960]   because their deeds were evil. Their natures are rotten. They're perverted. They're blinded by sin.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:58.040]   They're ignorant of God and they hate him. Their hearts are opposed to him. So you see, you can
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:04.360]   modify your message and you can put it in philosophic terms. You won't save a single soul.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.160]   You can, on the other hand, bring in your jazz music and your bands and all your tomfoolery of
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:15.560]   this new program, and you won't save a single soul. Nothing that you can do will ever save a soul.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   The Spirit alone can do this work. It is his. There is nothing and no one that can convict a man of sin
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:29.320]   save the Holy Spirit. I can prove you wrong in many respects, but I can't convict you of sin.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:35.160]   I can make you miserable, perhaps, or make you happy. I can't convict you of sin.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:43.720]   And what every man born, the son of Adam, needs is to be broken down, to be convicted of sin,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:50.200]   to realize the state of his heart, to realize that it's an enmity against God, to realize that he's
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.840]   hateful and hating one another, to realize that there's no good in him, to say with the Apostle
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:00.440]   Paul, "In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing, that I'm vile, I'm rotten, vile,
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:09.480]   and full of sin I am." Nothing but the Spirit of God can do that. Nothing but the Spirit of God can
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:19.000]   enlighten a man's mind with regard to God, just and holy as thy name. Only the Spirit of God can
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:28.840]   lead a man to say that, "I am all unrighteousness, vile and full of sin I am, thou art full of truth
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:36.360]   and grace." There is no power in the universe tonight that can bring a man's mind to see that
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:43.000]   except the power of the Holy Ghost. Nothing else can do it, nothing whatsoever. So why give your
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.640]   time and attention to them? Why bother with your mind or your modern methods? Nothing can do it,
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:54.120]   nothing can avail. It's beyond the reach of man and all his ingenuity in every realm and department.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:01.560]   The Spirit of God alone can do it, nothing else. And he alone can give faith.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:10.680]   "God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:18.600]   things of God. Now we have received not the Spirit that is of the world." And you know, the hallmark
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.880]   of these things is that they're totally unlike the world. There's nothing here belonging to the world,
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.600]   there's nothing like the world in it. It's the Spirit of God we have received, not the Spirit
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:40.280]   that is of the world in any shape or form. But the Spirit that is of God. "In order that we might know
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:50.200]   the things that are freely given to us by God." He alone can do it. And therefore we must pray to him.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:59.720]   And like the apostles, we must give ourselves continually to prayer as well as to the ministry
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   of the Word. But that brings me to my third and my last reason why these men prayed, and it was this.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:14.040]   They not only realized their own weakness and impotence, inadequacy and unworthiness.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:22.440]   They not only had a realization of the state and the condition of men and women by nature,
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:36.040]   but they realized also the nature of this great salvation. What is it? What is this salvation?
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.640]   What is it that we are given by the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:48.200]   Well, my dear friends, I hope to tell you more about this on a subsequent occasion,
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:55.160]   but let me say this this evening. For here is the very heart and center of this matter.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:00.920]   It is not merely help. It is not merely assistance.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:11.160]   It is not merely comfort. It is not merely happiness and joy. What does he give us? What do we need?
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:21.640]   What is the real need of men this evening? And there is only one answer.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:34.840]   Regeneration. Nothing less. Here is the very thing that is stated by our blessed Lord himself
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.960]   in his famous interview with Nicodemus, you remember?
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:50.200]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again,
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:47:00.600]   he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:07.000]   of water and of the Spirit, he cannot see it, cannot enter it, have nothing to do with it.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:18.680]   He must be born again." That is the very essence of this Christian message.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:26.440]   And that is what differentiates it from all your cults and all your religions.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:39.480]   It isn't help, it isn't aid. It is to be born again, to be born of the Spirit, born from above.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:46.200]   Well, this is put to us endlessly. Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it, again to the Ephesians,
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:55.080]   "Ye who hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, but God for his great
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:00.920]   love were with thee loved us even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:07.640]   Christ and hath raised us together by him. By grace are ye saved." And on he goes. You see what
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:17.720]   it means. Or again, come back to our Lord in his words to Nicodemus, "The wind bloweth where it
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:26.680]   listeth. Thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:38.120]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again,
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:57.880]   Don't marvel. It's a miracle, it's a mystery. Man can't do this. It's God, it's the Spirit of God,
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   born of the Spirit, born of water, born from above, the mighty action of God. If any man be in
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:12.120]   Christ, what is he? He's a new creature, a new creation. He's not merely a man who's taken a
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:23.400]   decision. No, no, God has acted on him. God has made him anew and afresh. God who commended the
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:30.760]   light to shine out of darkness, that's creation at the beginning, has shined in our hearts to
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:37.560]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It's God's action.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:44.200]   It is God who made us, in making us anew, recreating us, regenerating us, making us from
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:51.160]   the very depths, giving us a new life, a new nature, a new disposition, not improving us,
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:57.560]   not doing this or that, nothing that men can do, what God alone can do, implanting in us a seed of
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:06.920]   divine nature, putting a principle and a disposition of the life of God into our very beings.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:16.920]   That is the need of mankind, is to be born again, is to undergo that regeneration.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:24.360]   And can't you see, my dear friend, if that is the need, and it has been the need ever since the fall?
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:30.840]   It doesn't change. Twentieth century makes no difference, and your modern methods and your new
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:44.440]   gospels are valueless. Thou must save, and thou alone. And so these apostles, you see, realizing
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:57.800]   these things, they said, "We shall give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:06.440]   Word, the Word that alone can give life and a knowledge of salvation, the Word that alone is
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:17.560]   truth, the Word concerning God's only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, the meaning of his death upon
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:26.280]   the cross and his glorious resurrection, but the Word that can give life and life anew,
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:40.440]   the Word that leads to renovation, recreation, the Word that makes a man a new man.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things are passed away.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:52:03.480]   Behold, all things are become new. Thou must save, and thou alone.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:09.640]   They can't, they know they can't. They've seen the depths of the problem.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:23.080]   God alone can do it, and God can do it. And the supreme need of the preacher is to be filled with
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:33.000]   the Spirit of God. And he obtains that by waiting upon him, by spending his time in prayer,
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.760]   by opening out his mind and his heart and the whole of his being,
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:46.360]   and pleading with God to fill him, to energize him, to put this dynamic energy into him,
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:56.440]   which alone can save souls, which alone can bring men and women to a new birth. Indeed,
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:03.960]   it comes back to this. The Apostle Paul said it all in one phrase in writing to the Thessalonians.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   "Our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost,
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:25.800]   and in much assurance." Oh, here it is again. "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:31.560]   words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. I'm told that Teddy
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:37.400]   Boy, the ruler, rocker, whatever he is, he doesn't understand the terminology. I know,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.200]   it doesn't matter, but the Holy Spirit can make him understand. The Holy Spirit of God
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:47.640]   can enlighten blind minds. He can give understanding to the ignorant. He can give
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:54.120]   insight to those who are utterly bereft. It is his power, and with him nothing is impossible.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.800]   So the need is not the need of a new message or new methods.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:13.880]   It is still the old need of the mighty Spirit of God in revival, the Spirit of God in every one of
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:19.560]   us, in every little preacher like myself, so that men see not men, but the power of God,
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.880]   and they stand not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:33.960]   And they henceforth live only unto him and to his glory." God willing,
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.000]   we shall go on next Sunday night to look at this new man in Christ Jesus,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.360]   and we shall see yet more and more clearly why these men said nothing will do but his power.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:51.800]   Let's wake upon him. They dare not go and face the people in themselves and with their own powers.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:59.160]   They must have him. "And they gave themselves therefore continually to prayer,
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:07.960]   that being filled with the Spirit they might become channels and vehicles of God's miraculous,
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:18.760]   supernatural, new creating power through Jesus Christ his Son." Have you known this power?
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:26.600]   I don't ask you what you've done. I'm asking you have you known the power of God upon your life,
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:36.120]   smashing you, making you nothing, then making you anew? Do you know that you've been made anew in
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:42.600]   Christ Jesus? Have you felt the hands of God dealing with you, the Spirit of God making you
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.400]   anew? Have you known the power? If you haven't, you're not a Christian, whatever you've done.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:56:00.040]   This is Christianity. "You hath he quickened who were dead." But now you've been made anew
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:07.240]   after the pattern and the image of God's dear Son. My friend, if you don't know this power,
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:14.120]   plead with him, wait upon him, ask him, crave it from him, and don't give yourself rest nor peace
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:23.000]   until you have known the power of God making you anew, and you know that you're a new man
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:31.720]   or a new woman in Christ Jesus. Now let us sing our closing hymn that sums up all this,
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:40.600]   hymn number 378. "Lord, I was blind, I could not see in thy mad visage any grace,
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:50.040]   but now the beauty of thy face in radiant vision dawns on me." 378.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:57:06.840]   [organ music]
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:25.640]   [choir singing]
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:31.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
