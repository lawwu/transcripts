[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.360]   - Megan, one of our podcast listeners,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.680]   writes in to ask this.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.880]   "Pastor John, I have a confession.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.100]   "I love stuff and I am very materialistic.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.280]   "I buy things online and get a thrill in buying,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.920]   "as well as getting things in the mail.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.060]   "I know I need to stop this and I wanna stop this,
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.280]   "but how do I?
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.160]   "And why do I do this in the first place?"
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.560]   What would you say to Megan?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.560]   - I have tasted enough of what Megan is talking about
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.680]   that I think I can speak with some sense of empathy.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.200]   Even though for me,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   the temptation is almost entirely restricted to books.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.120]   As you can imagine.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.080]   I love to look at Amazon.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.280]   I mean, I love to click immediately on some new,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.600]   like Doug Sweeney, Jonathan Edwards,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.560]   the ex-Sajit, oh, hasten the day, right?
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.800]   - And I just love to click, one click,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.840]   be here in two days, 'cause I'm an Amazon Prime guy.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.360]   And when the doorbell rings
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.400]   and the FedEx guy is walking down the sidewalk,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.840]   there rises up in me a kind of euphoria
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.040]   that I'm gonna get to open a box
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   and in it's gonna be a book.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.360]   I mean, I think I know what she's talking about.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.720]   I mean, for her, it may be clothing.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.000]   I don't know what it is for her,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.680]   but she likes stuff and books are stuff.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.720]   They're more than stuff, but they're stuff.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.840]   And so I feel the issue here.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   And we are swimming in treacherous waters.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.360]   Why is it that we get this kind of pleasure
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.600]   from ordering things, things that we can hold in our hands?
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.480]   And why is it that our pleasure rises
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   when those things come in the mail?
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   And as I've tried to analyze my own heart,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   as well as read about the experience of others
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.200]   and look in the Bible
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   and look at the way people market things to us,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.120]   it seems to me that the pleasure rises
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.000]   mainly from the elusive sense
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   that buying and receiving things is life-giving.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.720]   It feels life-giving,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720]   or it feels like I get a sense of empowerment here.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.840]   When this book arrives, for example,
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   there's a kind of this amorphous, euphoric sense
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.600]   that life is gonna be better for me now.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.440]   My knowledge is gonna be larger.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.360]   My influence is gonna be greater.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.440]   Some of my weaknesses and limitations of ignorance
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   and looking foolish 'cause I've never heard of this book
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.040]   are gonna be overcome.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.480]   In other words, there's a sense
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.560]   that somehow my life will go better
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.040]   and I will be stronger, more capable person.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.480]   And of course, for someone else, it may not be books.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.720]   It may be clothing or tools or gadgets
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.200]   or the newest device.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   And in their case, the life-giving empowerment
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240]   wouldn't be necessarily like mine.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   It might be you're gonna look better,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.480]   you're gonna be more productive,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   you're gonna be more cool with your latest data device
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.840]   and so on.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.880]   And we should admit, I suppose, in passing here,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720]   that to some degree, there's truth in that.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.600]   Maybe, maybe.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.680]   We may indeed be enhanced in some way
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.400]   to be more productive or fruitful in a good way,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.560]   not just a bad way.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.440]   But if we're honest, and it seems to me
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.160]   that Megan is really being honest,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   the pleasures that we feel are not often totally noble.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.760]   They're not coming primarily from the fact
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.840]   that we are being equipped as better servants of Christ
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   because we just clicked and got it in two days
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.040]   and could open the box.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.840]   So we need to hear the words of Jesus.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   Take care and be on your guard against all covetousness
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.800]   for one's life does not consist
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   in the abundance of his possessions.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.880]   It seems to me that strikes right
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.760]   at the heart of the matter.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   Life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.320]   That feeling, that arrival of the package in the mail,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   that feeling is an illusion.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.600]   The euphoria is short-lived, it's shallow.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   It keeps us from deeper pleasures that we were made for.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.680]   And another reason why I think we're so hungry
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.600]   for this kind of elusive, life-giving, empowering pleasure
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   is because there's a void in our hearts,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.520]   some measure of emptiness that Jesus intends
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   to satisfy by himself, his fellowship, his ministry.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.160]   Paul says in Philippians 4
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.960]   that he learned the secret of contentment
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.320]   so that he could have little and stay contentment.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.680]   No doorbell ringing this week, no packages showing up,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   totally content, door ringing three, four times,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.880]   totally content.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.440]   And the reason he gave is chapter three,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.240]   I count everything as lost because of the surpassing value
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.280]   of knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.760]   Jesus Christ was such an overwhelming value
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   and a precious treasure for Paul
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.280]   that the ups and downs of having much
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.600]   or having little, doorbell ringing, doorbell not ringing,
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   clicking or not clicking, did not destroy his contentment.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.880]   His craving heart was satisfied on Jesus.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   So Megan and I need to devote ourselves
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   to feeding our hearts on Christ and his word,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.800]   but not just his word and his fellowship are satisfying.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   I think, I'm thinking now of Acts 20, verse 30
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.720]   that says, Jesus is quoted,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.600]   "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   The fact that Megan or I would get more pleasure
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.280]   out of receiving than giving shows
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.080]   that something's gone wrong in our hearts.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.640]   We were designed as followers of Christ
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   to experience even greater euphoria in giving
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.440]   than in the doorbell ringing and a new package coming.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.240]   And perhaps this pleasure has fallen
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   into disuse for Megan maybe, and she needs to recover it.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.960]   And that very pleasure of giving would, I think,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   dampen the pleasures of material possession.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.680]   I would mention perhaps just two other things real quick.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.520]   One is that Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.200]   he didn't want to be enslaved or mastered by anything.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.840]   We're free in Jesus.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.520]   Megan, as a Christian, is free in Jesus.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.040]   And she and I should be on the lookout
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.280]   for anything that has an enslaving force in our lives.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.160]   And when we spot it, we should wave the flag
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.960]   of Christian liberty in front of it
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.640]   and say, "You will not enslave me.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.440]   I'm a free woman or I'm a free man.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.800]   You material thing will not control me
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.680]   and renounce it in the name of our freedom."
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.480]   And maybe just one more, the best thing I could say,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.520]   because it's so breathtaking, it's so influential
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.360]   and powerful when it grips us, is this.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.480]   1 Corinthians 3, 21.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.640]   Megan, listen carefully.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   "Let no one boast in men," or I would say in things,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:18.120]   "for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.800]   or Cephas or the world or life or death
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.560]   or the present or the future.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.040]   All things are yours and you are Christ and Christ is God."
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.920]   Megan, if you are a Christian,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.320]   you already possess all material things.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.540]   You really do.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.280]   Your Father created and owns everything,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.180]   everything in the universe.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.440]   And as His child, you will inherit it
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.720]   and it will be at your disposal in the age to come
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.760]   on the new earth, in the new heavens,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.960]   and you will be able to do with it as you please.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.480]   This is why Jesus said,
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.760]   "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.800]   but in heaven."
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.720]   In heaven, we will have them forever.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.600]   We won't lose them, no rust, no thief.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.200]   And we will be able for the very first time
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.460]   to use them with joy, without any greed,
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.440]   without any covetousness, without any idolatry.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   So in a sense, abundance of material things can wait.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.840]   We have more important things to do right now.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   Love God, love people,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.860]   and find the greatest pleasure in giving.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.700]   Yeah, amen.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.060]   And with that, the week comes to an end.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.920]   If you missed any of the episodes from the week,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.440]   you can catch up with the daily
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.080]   Ask Pastor John podcast apps,
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.280]   and you can go online to our online home
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.800]   And you can keep up with all of the episodes there as well.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.160]   On Monday, we tackle that age old question
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.840]   of how do I know what God is calling me to do?
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.600]   Who or what should we follow
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.840]   as we seek to follow God's plan for our lives?
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.420]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:16.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
