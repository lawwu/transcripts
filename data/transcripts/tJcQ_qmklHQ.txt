[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   Bible memorization is hard. It requires time, willpower, concentration, and that means we
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.860]   need good motivations for doing it in the first place, which is exactly what John Piper
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.160]   offers us in his sermon titled "If My Words Abide in You," which he preached on January
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.040]   4th, 2009. Here's a clip of what he said.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:37.800]   The reason I began this message by reciting Psalm 1, Psalm 16, Psalm 103, Romans 5, 1-8,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.240]   Romans 8, Matthew 6, 1, 25-34, 1 Corinthians 13, is in the hope and the desperate prayer
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.360]   that God would do for you what He did for me 31 years ago. I was 31 years old and I
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.520]   walked into the gym at Bethel College for chapel. I was teaching and I sat down and
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:10.800]   R. Lewis stood up, the Old Testament professor, and he recited Matthew 6, 25-34. That's all.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.900]   He just looked at us and recited it. I was stunned. I was 31 years old and had never
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:30.920]   seen anybody in church recite the Scriptures. It blew me away. It set me on a trajectory
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.600]   of Bible memory. And all I want to do in this simple message is to give my testimony and
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   mingle it with Jesus' testimony of the value of memorizing Scripture. I'm pleading with
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   you. So here's my testimony. I can give it to you in eight sentences without exposition.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.220]   Number one, memorizing Scripture makes meditation possible at times when you can't be reading
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.600]   the Bible and meditation is the pathway to deeper understanding. So if you're going to
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.040]   meditate on the law of the Lord day and night, you need to have some of it in your head.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.720]   Number two, memorizing Scripture strengthens my faith because faith comes from hearing
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.600]   and hearing by the Word of God. And that happens when I am hearing the Word in my head.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.160]   Number three, memorizing Scripture shapes the way I view the world by conforming my
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.280]   mind to God's viewpoint on everything.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.160]   Number four, memorizing Scripture makes God's Word more readily accessible in overcoming
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.460]   temptation to sin because God's warnings and promises are the way we conquer the lies,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.640]   the deceitful lies of the devil.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:01.020]   Number five, memorizing Scripture guards my mind, making it easier for me to detect error.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.460]   And the world is filled with error because the God of this world is a liar.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.120]   Number six, memorizing Scripture enables me to hit the devil in the face with a force
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.220]   he cannot resist to protect myself and my family from his assaults.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:30.620]   What are you hitting him with? He is millions of times stronger than you. And he hates you
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.820]   and your family and your marriage and this church and God.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:44.040]   How anybody walks through this devil-ruled world without a sword in their hand is beyond
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.560]   me.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.240]   Memorizing Scripture provides the strongest and sweetest words for ministering to others
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   in need.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.040]   Have you ever been caught off guard with somebody in need? You don't need to be caught
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.320]   off guard.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.600]   And finally, number eight, memorizing Scripture provides the matrix for fellowship with Jesus
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:20.720]   because He talks to me here and nowhere else but oh, sweetly, powerfully, authentically,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.680]   speaks to me here.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.840]   And then I speak back to Him in prayer. And if this is here, we can talk anywhere. And
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.440]   it's sweet. It is very sweet.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.240]   So good. That was taken from a sermon titled "If My Words Abide in You," which was
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.680]   preached on January 4th, 2009.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.480]   Thank you to podcast listener Josh Grass, who found this little gem and sent it in to

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.020]   Stuck in sin.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.220]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
