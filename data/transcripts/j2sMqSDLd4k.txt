[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.740]   given to studies of mental health, physical health,
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.940]   and human performance.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900]   If you'd like to subscribe

[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.220]   So without further ado,
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.720]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.860]   The first question is about fluoride.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.940]   And the specific question is,
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.660]   why is fluoride in our water and how much is it harming us?
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.180]   Okay, well, that might seem like a short question,
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.960]   but there's actually a lot to that question.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.540]   And I want to be very clear by posing the question,
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.240]   how much is it harming us?
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.320]   It implies that fluoride is harming us.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.140]   And I want to be very clear,
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.300]   the degree to which fluoride can harm you or not harm you
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.640]   depends on how much of it happens to be in the water
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.760]   or toothpaste or some other thing that you're consuming.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.340]   Okay, so this is very important.
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.620]   I don't want the question to seem like a leading question
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.240]   to imply that fluoride is necessarily harming us
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.360]   because as I'm about to tell you,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.500]   there are clear benefits of fluoride for tooth strength
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.560]   and for warding off cavities.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.860]   But if you get too much fluoride into your system,
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.540]   it is dangerous.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.980]   It is a poison at certain levels.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.420]   So as you've probably heard before,
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.940]   the dose makes the poison.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.440]   So let's take this seemingly simple question
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.540]   and dissect it in two.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.260]   The first part of the question was,
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.100]   why is fluoride in our water?
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.800]   And believe it or not, even that is hard to answer directly
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   because here's what's happening right now in 2024.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.780]   There is a major lawsuit in the state of California
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.980]   to try and get fluoride removed from the drinking water.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620]   The outcome of that case is still yet to be determined,
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.340]   but the case was filed by a group of individuals
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.800]   who strongly believe that fluoride at any concentration
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.940]   in the drinking water is bad.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.180]   Why would they say that and what is their evidence
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.440]   and how strong is that evidence?
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.580]   Well, there is some evidence that if levels of fluoride
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.360]   in drinking water exceed a certain threshold,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   it can cause problems with thyroid hormone function
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.460]   and perhaps even certain aspects of brain function.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.180]   Again, if the levels exceed a certain threshold.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.720]   So in the state of California, there is a major lawsuit
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.460]   to try and get fluoride removed from the drinking water.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.660]   Now at the same time, meaning right now,
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.020]   there is also a major lawsuit in the United States,
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.420]   this one taking place in Buffalo, New York,
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.660]   whereby citizens are suing the city
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.220]   because they insist that there is not enough fluoride
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.060]   in the water and they are suing for damages
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.740]   based on the dental health needs of their children
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.720]   that did not, in their opinion,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.760]   get enough fluoride in the drinking water.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.080]   So I'm telling you about all of this
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.660]   because the question again was,
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.640]   why is fluoride in our drinking water?
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.680]   And believe it or not,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.300]   there are certain states in the United States,
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.060]   certain areas of the United States where the fluoride levels
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.720]   in the drinking water are low, are zero, perhaps.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.160]   That's what the lawsuit in Buffalo is about.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   And by the way, the city of Buffalo may have now corrected
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.780]   the amount of fluoride in the water,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.240]   taking it from zero to something.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.520]   Whether or not it was actually zero is still debatable,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.140]   but I think you're starting to get the point
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.960]   that there is a wide, wide divergence
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.020]   in terms of how safe people feel
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.320]   about having fluoride in drinking water.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.620]   Some people want it and are suing cities
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.340]   because they feel there wasn't enough of it
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.860]   in their drinking water,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.160]   and others don't want any fluoride in their drinking water,
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.940]   and they're suing cities because of that, okay?
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.220]   So this is a really barbed wire topic, as I like to say.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.780]   It's one that no matter how close you get to it,
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.100]   whatever angle you look at it,
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.460]   you're likely to get stuck a little bit
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.120]   it's going to be a little bit painful.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.900]   Okay, why is fluoride in some drinking water at all?
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.220]   Okay, let's set aside the levels
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.540]   and just answer that question.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.180]   Well, in an upcoming episode of the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.380]   about oral health, I'll get into this in a lot more detail,
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.980]   but fluoride is a really interesting compound
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.880]   with respect to oral health, and here's why.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.420]   Your teeth, believe it or not, are always in a state
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.420]   of either demineralization or remineralization.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.720]   Those are tricky words to say.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.620]   Go ahead and try and say it.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.740]   Demineralization, remineralization.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.900]   So I'm going to refer to them as demin for demineralization
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.080]   and remin for remineralization.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.300]   Okay, your teeth are always in one state or the other,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.700]   where one state predominates versus the other.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.740]   Now, a cavity in your mouth occurs when bacteria,
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.140]   in particular, Streptococcus mutans,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.660]   sometimes called strep mutans,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.100]   feeds on sugars in your mouth,
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.660]   and then as a byproduct of that feeding,
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.960]   creates acids that then erode the enamel
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.140]   and deeper layers of your teeth.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.580]   In other words, it demineralizes the tooth.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.540]   Now, I just told you that your teeth can be in a state
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.520]   of demin or remin at any moment.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.680]   The way that your teeth remin, the way they remineralize
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.120]   and can potentially fill in little cavities
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.380]   that have not yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.300]   is through a process that involves the construction
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.380]   of crystals from minerals.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.440]   Okay, that's why it's called remineralization.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.740]   And get this, this is really wild.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.220]   These minerals actually stack together
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.300]   in very organized little sequences,
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.900]   kind of like Lego blocks.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.780]   And the critical element within those blocks
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.220]   is something called hydroxyapatite.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.680]   I love that it has the word apatite in it
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.900]   'cause we're talking about oral health.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.140]   That's the normal process.
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.300]   Fluoride was discovered not because it's a vitamin,
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.000]   not because it's an essential nutrient.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.520]   In fact, at high concentrations, it's actually a poison.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.560]   I'll tell you a story about that in a moment
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.400]   where I was actually poisoned by fluoride
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.960]   at the dentist when I was a kid,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.580]   in large part due to my own error.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.020]   Fluoride, it was discovered,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.840]   can actually get inside of those Lego chain-like crystals,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.200]   the building of those, and form bonds between them
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.920]   that are actually stronger than the hydroxyapatite bonds
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.260]   that would normally form.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.880]   In other words, if you consume fluoridated water
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.560]   or use toothpaste with fluoride,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.700]   especially if you do this when you're a kid,
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.000]   what ends up happening is that the crystals
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.240]   and the mineralization structure of the teeth
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.920]   becomes ultra strong, meaning super physiologically strong,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.280]   which then limits the ability for that strep mutans
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.620]   and the acid strep mutans produces when it eats sugar
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.200]   to erode the enamel of your teeth,
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.720]   causing what we refer to as cavities.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   Okay, so I went and asked several dentists
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.800]   and a periodontist about why is fluoride in drinking water?
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.680]   Why is fluoride in toothpaste?
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.820]   And they, of course, gave me the explanation
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.440]   that I just gave you,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.520]   which is a chemical mechanical explanation or rationale.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.360]   However, most of the things for our health,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.520]   such as the foods we eat, the amount of exercise that we do,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   are not naturally put into our environment, right?
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.960]   But tap water, which goes out to everyone
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   who consumes it from the tap,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.800]   is basically a government
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.900]   or local government supplied resource.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.720]   And basically the rationale was,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.040]   and I believe this took place first in the 1950s,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.920]   was, okay, given the potential for fluoride
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.500]   to make super physiologically strong teeth,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.440]   what can we do to reduce the cavities and tooth decay
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.200]   that would occur in children and adult populations?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.540]   Let's put fluoride in the drinking water.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.800]   So that's what they did.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.920]   They did not do this, I was told,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.040]   because it was necessarily the best way
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.240]   to take care of teeth and avoid cavities.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.820]   It turns out there are a bunch of other things
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.180]   that you can do.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.320]   Even if you consume no fluoridated water or toothpaste,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.340]   there are things that you can do
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.900]   to enhance the mineralization state of your teeth,
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.160]   even fill in cavities, provided those cavities
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.280]   haven't made it into the deeper so-called
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.740]   dentine layers of the teeth.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.120]   I'll get into all of this in that future episode.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.980]   But what the US and other governments decided,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.400]   this of course varies across the world
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.580]   to the extent to which there's fluoride
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.700]   in the drinking water or not,
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.000]   was that by putting fluoride in the drinking water,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.560]   they could prevent a large amount of tooth decay
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.520]   and cavities that would otherwise occur, okay?
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.740]   It was a, and remains, a fairly low cost approach
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.300]   for these cities to introduce fluoride
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   to the drinking water.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.900]   And that's why fluoride is in drinking water.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.800]   It is to try and create super physiologically strong teeth.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.020]   And indeed, every single dentist I spoke to,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.200]   including functional dentists, I spoke to periodontists,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.400]   I spoke to several dentists ranging from,
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.240]   let's call them more traditionally trained dentists
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.160]   to more, let's call them alternative dentists,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.660]   all of them agree that at a chemical, mechanical level,
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.340]   fluoride creates stronger teeth.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.120]   However, every single one of them also acknowledged
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.460]   that the bonds that are created
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.260]   in those mineralization chains, as I'm referring to,
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.780]   I realize that's not the technical term,
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.780]   is not the normal hydroxyapatite bonds that would form.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.860]   They are stronger than the bonds that would normally form.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.300]   They are structurally different.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.740]   If you look at them down what's called
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.660]   an electron microscope,
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.100]   you'll see that they're structurally different.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.940]   And some, not all of the dentists I spoke to,
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.900]   said, yeah, you know,
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.420]   it would be best to remineralize the teeth
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.820]   to fill in any cavities that initially have formed,
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.120]   again, not down to the deep layers,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.900]   but they could still be filled in naturally
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.540]   through the building up
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.380]   of those hydroxyapatite natural bonds.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.660]   But they acknowledged that many people,
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.540]   perhaps most people, don't take adequate care
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.540]   of their mouths and their teeth.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.620]   So they understood the rationale
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.540]   of putting fluoride into drinking water.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.180]   And of course, that's also why fluoride
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.580]   is in many, not all toothpaste.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.060]   Okay, so I'm hoping that clearly answers for you
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.980]   the question of why there is fluoride
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.660]   in our drinking water at all.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.980]   At least in most American cities,
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.540]   there is fluoride in the drinking water.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.620]   Although this lawsuit in Buffalo,
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.740]   I guess soon to be determined,
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.700]   will probably tell us whether or not indeed
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.320]   there was a total lack or a partial lack of fluoride
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.260]   in the drinking water there.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.600]   I'm presuming that the accusation is true,
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.060]   but I don't actually know that to be true.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.760]   I just know that there's a lawsuit that exists.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.600]   If you Google that,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.900]   you can see some YouTube videos about it.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.060]   There's information about this happening.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.460]   There are a bunch of angry parents
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.700]   and I'm sure there are angry parents on the other side.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.220]   And I don't know what the kids are saying,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.680]   but hopefully no matter what,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.620]   they're saying them through healthy teeth.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.640]   Okay, now the second half of the question was,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.420]   how much is the fluoride in drinking water harming us?
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.180]   Okay, I'm going to answer this question very specifically.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.100]   The person asks, how much is the fluoride
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.320]   in our drinking water harming us?
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.740]   Well, I already told you ways in which
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.920]   it is helping the strength of your teeth, right?
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.520]   That's not debated.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.340]   Okay, again, there might be some dentists that say,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.280]   oh, you know, the bonds that are formed by fluoride
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.960]   are different than the ones that are naturally created
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.920]   with no fluoride.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.580]   And so there might be some debate about that,
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.900]   but all of them acknowledge that those bonds
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.260]   and the mineralization of the teeth
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.160]   is stronger with fluoride.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.420]   They understand and agree with the rationale,
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.980]   even if they don't necessarily agree with the practice
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.340]   as the best practice.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.760]   How much is fluoride in drinking water harming you?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.960]   Well, there are two things you need to ask.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.260]   One is how much fluoride are you actually drinking?
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.600]   Because it turns out there's a tremendous range
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.900]   of fluoride concentrations in tap water,
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.660]   depending on what city you live in.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.060]   Now, I did an entire episode
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.900]   of the Huberman Lab podcast about water.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.340]   We talked about distilled water versus spring water.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.560]   We talked about hydrogenated water.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.660]   We talked about alkaline water.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.120]   We talked about all of those things.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.620]   And we did talk about fluoride.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.000]   And one of the key takeaways
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.180]   when you're thinking about fluoride in drinking water
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.940]   is to know that if fluoride concentrations
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.640]   in drinking water are too high,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.720]   or, and this is a very important or,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.640]   or you're consuming a lot of a particular water
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.040]   that contains even low levels of fluoride,
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.240]   well, there's the potential.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.220]   And again, I want to highlight the word potential here.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.340]   I don't want to cause alarm.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.600]   That the fluoride is causing disruptions
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.200]   to thyroid hormone output or on the receptor end,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.360]   in other words, disruptions to thyroid hormone metabolism
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.980]   and usage in the body.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.380]   Okay, I want to be really clear here.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.460]   I don't want people to think,
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.920]   oh, fluoride destroys your thyroid hormone.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.860]   It's the dose that makes the poison.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.240]   It depends on how much.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.800]   Now, the Center for Disease Control
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   have set a recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per liter,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.200]   0.7 milligrams per liter of fluoride in drinking water
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.440]   as the level, and here I'm paraphrasing,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.920]   that can help prevent tooth decay
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.460]   and promote good oral health and that they have deemed safe.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.840]   But if you want to know how much fluoride
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.220]   is in your drinking water,
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.820]   whether or not it is above, at, or below that value,
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.100]   you need to get your tap water tested.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.660]   Now, fortunately, there are websites that can tell you
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.920]   how much fluoride is in your drinking water.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.060]   And if you trust the data on those websites,
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.680]   you can simply put the city you live in
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.520]   into one of those websites
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.720]   and you'll get the information back.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.080]   I'll provide a few links to those different websites
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.800]   in the show note captions for this episode.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.580]   We also provided those links in the show note captions
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.320]   for the episode on water.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.160]   And then you can see,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.640]   are you adjusting the level of fluoride
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.880]   in your drinking water that's deemed safe,
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.320]   less than that value, or more than that value?
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.960]   But keep in mind that if you drink a little bit,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.520]   a moderate amount, or a lot of fluoridated drinking water,
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.320]   you're going to be consuming either more or less fluoride.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.560]   Just because there's a concentration that's been deemed safe
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.960]   by the Center for Disease Control
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.600]   does not actually tell you whether or not,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.840]   okay, if you're drinking half a gallon of tap water a day
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.340]   versus a gallon versus just a couple cups,
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.520]   whether or not you are in that safe zone.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.760]   And of course, this is going to vary by body weight, right?
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.200]   If you're a small child,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.420]   those lower levels of fluoride are going to equate
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.000]   to a larger total amount of fluoride
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.400]   as seen by the volume of the body, right?
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.440]   If you think about this, right?
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.120]   Everything's by body weight volume.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.980]   This is why drug dosages are most typically calculated
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.320]   as a function of pounds or kilograms of body weight, right?
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.020]   Not everybody gets the same dose of every drug.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.320]   And if you're a very large person,
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.480]   maybe you can tolerate more fluoride.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.720]   As I mentioned before,
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.320]   high levels of fluoride have been shown
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.480]   to disrupt thyroid metabolism.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.480]   It has also been hypothesized,
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.160]   again, this is still highly debated,
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.740]   hypothesized to be neurotoxic under certain conditions,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.480]   that is toxic to neurons that can kill neurons
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.880]   at certain concentrations,
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.720]   not necessarily the concentrations present
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.420]   in your drinking water.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.500]   A lot of the evidence that fluoride is neurotoxic
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.320]   is from so-called in vitro studies.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.020]   So studies done effectively in a dish,
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.860]   although there is some in vivo evidence
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.620]   that it can cause neurotoxicity, AKA neurodegeneration.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.500]   So I think when it comes to the topic of fluoride,
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.980]   people tend to bin out into not concerned
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.540]   and simply want fluoride to strengthen their teeth.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.880]   Mildly concerned, you know,
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.380]   kind of keeping an eye on this stuff.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.340]   You know, okay, fluoride doesn't sound great for me,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.840]   but you know, as long as the concentrations aren't too high,
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   you know, as people will say,
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.240]   I've been drinking tap water my whole life
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.980]   and I feel great, you know, my teeth are strong
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.500]   and my brain works and my thyroid seems fine.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.240]   Okay, and then people who are very, very concerned
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.440]   about fluoride at any concentration in their drinking water,
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.500]   hence the lawsuit in California
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.900]   and other lawsuits around the country.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.700]   So I believe that when we're talking about fluoride,
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.360]   you really need to think about the dosages
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.720]   and you need to ask yourself
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.460]   which one of those three categories you fall into.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.460]   Now, if you are concerned about fluoride,
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.220]   it does not necessarily mean that you can't drink tap water.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.900]   The suggestion simply would be to filter that tap water.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.380]   And during the episode I did on water,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.020]   I talked about a number of different filtration approaches.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.260]   Many of those filters will filter out fluoride
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.620]   and you can simply look up, you know,
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.260]   water filters that eliminate or reduce fluoride.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.160]   And then some people have enough disposable income
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.700]   and/or are concerned enough about fluoride
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.680]   in their drinking water that they will purchase
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.660]   or create very extensive, very thorough filtration systems
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.300]   to completely eliminate fluoride from their drinking water.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.540]   Okay, so you'll find different ranges of concern.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.820]   Again, aside from the data of high fluoride levels
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.860]   being disruptive to thyroid hormone pathways
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.020]   and possibly neurotoxic,
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.020]   I personally am somebody who filters the drinking water
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.080]   I consume out of the tap.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.780]   Unless that is, I'm going to boil water with it
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.840]   for making things like loose leaf yerba mate,
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.400]   which is one of my favorite drinks.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.840]   Although lately I drink this cold brew Matina yerba mate,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.740]   which by the way is made with purified water, no fluoride,
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.940]   and so on and so forth.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.080]   But if I'm making rice or I'm making pasta
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.840]   or I'm making oatmeal and I need to use tap water,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.280]   I don't worry about removing the fluoride from that water.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.880]   However, if I'm going to drink water,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.800]   if I'm going to mix, you know,
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.040]   an element electrolyte pack in
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.640]   or just drinks a glass of water
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.040]   or go out on a hike and take some water with me,
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.940]   I do use a water filter,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.160]   either a filter that fills from the top and then seeps down
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.720]   and the ones you put in the refrigerator,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.140]   or I recently purchased a whole house filter
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.480]   for the drinking water taps in my house
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.280]   so that it does remove all the fluoride
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.980]   and remove some other contaminants as well.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.000]   So it's going to depend on your level of concern
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.160]   and it's going to depend on your disposable income
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.400]   and any number of other things.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.080]   And I must say that every once in a while,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.420]   I'll drink a little bit of tap water out of the tap
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.320]   without any concern about filtering the fluoride.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.500]   I'm not somebody who gets hyper concerned about these things
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.460]   but I do understand why some people do get hyper concerned
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.300]   about these things,
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.680]   especially people who've read up on fluoride
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.800]   and some of the health concerns
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.220]   of consuming too much fluoride,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.580]   because I also find it very logical and understandable
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.220]   that as people learn more about how a particular substance
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.000]   might be harming their brain or bodily health,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.600]   that they would become more concerned
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.800]   about consuming that substance.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.500]   It just stands to reason.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500]   So what am I suggesting?
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.200]   I suggest that you figure out how much fluoride
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.240]   is in your tap water.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.180]   I suggest that you then make a decision
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.240]   as to whether or not to filter that water or not
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.140]   before drinking it.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.920]   And then of course, you have to make a decision
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   about what sort of financial investment
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   you're willing to make to filter that water.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.960]   You can find a list of different price ranges
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.680]   of water filters in the show note captions
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.540]   in the water episode.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.000]   You may also want to watch that episode
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.580]   and go to that timestamp.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.520]   And there's an enormous range there.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.440]   I want to be very clear.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.820]   I don't have a financial relationship
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.440]   to any of those filtration mechanisms.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.880]   Again, some people have $0 to devote to that process
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.780]   of taking the fluoride out of their water
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.840]   and other contaminants.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.080]   Some people have many, many tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.140]   So it really just depends on your disposable income
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.320]   and your level of concern.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   But if you were to ask me, I would say, yeah, I think,
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.360]   given that the cost of most of the filters
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.640]   that can remove most of the fluoride is low,
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.360]   and given that there is some health concern
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.320]   of consuming too much fluoride,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.740]   why not just remove fluoride from the drinking water?
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.420]   And then if you say, well, won't that weaken my teeth?
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.880]   Then I would say, well, watch the episode
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.340]   that's soon to come out on oral health,
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.180]   because it's going to explain a lot of approaches,
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.080]   including fluoride containing toothpaste,
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.540]   but some other non fluoride containing toothpaste
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.800]   and other things that one can do
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.380]   that the community of professionally trained dentists
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.600]   all agree can really help improve
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.420]   the mineralization state of your teeth.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.960]   And indeed can fill in cavities that have begun to form,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.440]   but haven't yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.920]   and on and on.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.760]   Now, I do have a brief story about fluoride
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.800]   that I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you,
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.920]   which essentially shows that fluoride is designed
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.380]   to strengthen teeth, but is also indeed a poison.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.260]   So when I was a kid, I had a lot of dental issues.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.900]   I didn't consume much sugar.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.640]   My mother fortunately was good
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.360]   about not letting us consume too much sugar,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.200]   but for whatever reason, my mouth was kind of a mess.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.140]   I'd brush, I'd floss, I would do all these things,
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.240]   but I actually had my adult teeth
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.760]   coming behind my baby teeth.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.720]   So it didn't push out my baby teeth.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.960]   So not only did I not collect from the tooth fairy,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.040]   which I only recently discovered isn't real,
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.680]   but how would I know?
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.840]   'Cause the tooth fairy never showed up
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   because all of my adult teeth came in behind my baby teeth.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.920]   So I had to have all of my baby teeth pulled on the top.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.300]   So I did not have a good relationship to the dentist
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.800]   as a location or a person.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.080]   In fact, they had to tell me not to bite the dentist.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.760]   By the way, I haven't bitten a dentist in a long time.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.340]   So hopefully my dentist, if watching this,
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.740]   is not too concerned.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.120]   I do get twice a year cleanings.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.580]   Every dentist agrees that's a good thing to do.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.100]   Some people may need less, some people may need more,
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.940]   but how do you know?
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.560]   You need to go to a dentist to find out.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.640]   Back to the story about fluoride.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.600]   I started going to the dentist quite a bit
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.640]   because of all these dental issues that I had as a kid.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.740]   And what they used to do,
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.720]   I don't know if they do this anymore,
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.640]   but what they used to do is they give you these little trays
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.160]   which are kind of like mouth guards
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.860]   that you would use for boxing or hockey
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.120]   so your teeth don't get knocked out.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.040]   And they would fill those trays with this jelly-like stuff
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.120]   that contained fluoride.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.320]   And they put it on the top and on the bottom.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.380]   And the stuff just, little bits of it would seep
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.620]   onto your tongue and your throat.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.640]   And it was so sour, it was so awful.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.120]   And they'd seat me in this little wicker chair
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.360]   in front of a television and turn on cartoons
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.880]   as if that was supposed to make me forget
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.520]   how awful the whole experience was.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.920]   If anything, it probably just created
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.560]   a Pavlovian condition response to hate cartoons,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   which I suppose did not work 'cause I liked cartoons then.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.600]   I don't watch them now, truly, I don't watch them now.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.700]   So I sit down in this wicker chair,
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.200]   I've got the fluoride in my teeth with these two trays,
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.140]   and I'm just hating this whole process.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.000]   I think I must've been about five or six years old.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.140]   So I decide in my infinite wisdom
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.300]   to just swallow all the fluoride pace.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.380]   So I start shucking it down through these mouth guards.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.320]   I can feel it going back into my throat
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.200]   and it's sour and it's stinging, it's awful,
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.040]   but I'm thinking, okay, I'm just going to like, you know,
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.080]   do this and I'm going to sit there.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.660]   I'm basically going to, I'm going to beat the test.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.600]   And so I drink all this fluoride paste.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.160]   And then of course I got immensely sick
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   within about three minutes.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.560]   I stood up, I turned around
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.040]   and puked all over the wicker chair.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.240]   I think that was deliberate.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   Actually looking back, it was deliberate.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.520]   And puke all over the wicker chair.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.500]   My mom comes running in, what happened?
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.480]   What'd you do to him?
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.540]   You know, she was very protective of me, thanks mom.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.380]   What'd you do to him?
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.880]   And then I said, you know, I just swallowed the stuff.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.820]   They wanted to do it again.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.060]   And I stopped doing the fluoride treatment at that point.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.540]   Why did I vomit?
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.500]   Well, I vomited because fluoride is indeed a poison
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.100]   at high concentrations.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.300]   Now, do I tell you that story to make you afraid
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.480]   of giving your kids fluoridated toothpaste
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.320]   or fluoridated water?
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.900]   No, by all means, do what you think is best for you
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.060]   and for your children.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.300]   For me, however, I've made some effort
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.740]   to avoid fluoride toothpaste.
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.240]   I do go to the dentist, as I mentioned, about once a year.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.420]   I confessed during the pandemic, it was probably less
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.940]   as they were, you know, busy
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.580]   and it was hard to schedule, et cetera.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.100]   I've had very, very few cavities in my adult life,
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.260]   hardly any.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.380]   And my gum health is very strong, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.860]   largely through taking on protocols
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.060]   that I'm going to describe in the oral health episode
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.900]   and that were recommended to me by friends
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.220]   who are both dentists and other friends who are periodontists
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.820]   because again, there are a lot of things that we can do
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.300]   to strengthen our teeth in natural ways
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.940]   by building up those hydroxyapatite bonds,
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.520]   which are the natural bonds that teeth form.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.740]   And yes, believe it or not,
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.420]   being able to reverse some early formed cavities
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.380]   as long as they haven't made it deep into the tooth.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.240]   Also things like using a soft toothbrush,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   because if you brush too hard, you know,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.080]   if you take that approach,
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.140]   you're going to brush your teeth really hard,
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.140]   get them really, really clean.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.280]   Yes, you'll scrape off all the biofilm,
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.460]   you'll avoid tartar buildup,
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.060]   but you can really cause some tenting of the gum tissue
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.900]   above the teeth.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.580]   And those little recesses back in there
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.620]   are where bacteria get in.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.620]   And there's now a lot of really strong evidence
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.420]   showing that some of that bacteria
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.920]   can translate into cardiac disease,
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.660]   can translate into metabolic disease,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.900]   and maybe even into some neurologic disease.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.860]   So it's serious stuff.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.300]   Oral health is one of the most important areas of health,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.940]   and it's one of the most overlooked areas of oral health.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.660]   And I think people generally fall into two categories,
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.960]   and I'll use these two categories
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.620]   to frame up the episode on oral health that's coming.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.260]   One category of person seems really bullish
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.100]   on their oral health.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.620]   They're like, "Keep my teeth white and clean,"
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.860]   and they floss and brush twice a day, every day,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.940]   and they use tooth whiteners and mouthwash
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.780]   and all those things.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.220]   And the other category is kind of blase about it.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.920]   "Yeah, brush my teeth in the morning
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.260]   so that my breath doesn't kill every person
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.740]   I get into an interaction with," and so on and so forth.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.000]   But in reality, both the group of people
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.980]   that are doing an immense number of things
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.420]   to try and keep their teeth white and their breath fresh
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.220]   are, yes, doing things that are good for their oral health,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.800]   but also no doubt damaging their oral health,
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.980]   in particular, the oral microbiome,
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.460]   which is absolutely critical.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.540]   And then, of course, the other category of people
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.740]   that are neglecting their oral hygiene
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.700]   and are not taking mouthwashes and things like that
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.600]   are also damaging their oral health, but in different ways.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.160]   So during the episode on oral health,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.940]   I'll spell out all the things that you can do,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.780]   most of which, by the way, are completely zero cost.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.740]   Many of them actually will save you money,
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.580]   both in the short and long-term,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.740]   and can really help you improve your oral microbiome,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.700]   the strength of your teeth,
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.680]   and reduce the number of cavities,
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.800]   maybe even reverse cavities that have begun to form
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.320]   and are not too deep into the tooth yet.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.800]   And in a really nice way,
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.240]   all of that independent of your stance on fluoride.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.080]   Thank you for joining
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.760]   for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.120]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.720]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.000]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.240]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.240]   please go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.440]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.640]   the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.520]   It's really twofold.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.440]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.920]   for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel,
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.180]   which of course will still be continued
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.640]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.040]   We are not going to change the format
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.620]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.060]   And to fund research,
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.120]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.160]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.960]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.160]   that we are most interested in.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.800]   that is in toward developing further protocols
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.840]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.740]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.160]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.000]   but through all channels,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.160]   Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.720]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.920]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.100]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.840]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   in the first place.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.200]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.160]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.520]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.440]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.040]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.000]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.060]   to further support research for science
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.840]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   physical health, and performance.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.200]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.960]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.040]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.800]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.140]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.020]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.620]   and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.000]   that other people ask as well.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.940]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.740]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.660]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.880]   of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.200]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.560]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.960]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.640]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.520]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.380]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.540]   (upbeat music)
