[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   like Jordan Peterson, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.080]   Like how do public intellectuals make themselves focal points?
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.060]   Well, by doing something noteworthy, right?
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.000]   So it can be an idea, but it can also be a form of performance art.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.040]   A lot of the IDW people have very clear peaks, which now lie in the past, and I suspect will
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.240]   have fairly rapid declines.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.240]   What do you think?
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   What's the explanation for why they peak so early?
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.680]   I don't know if early is the word.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.600]   Like Jordan Peterson was at it for a long time, but they made extreme bets on very particular
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.000]   ideas, and maybe different people will disagree about those ideas, but I think a lot of them
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.360]   are losing ideas, even if they might be correct in some ways.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.640]   I've done much less to bet on a single idea.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.400]   You can say kind of market-based economics, but it's not so radical.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.560]   Maybe it's not peak fashion now, but it's fine to be doing that.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.600]   They were over leveraged and they got margin called.
