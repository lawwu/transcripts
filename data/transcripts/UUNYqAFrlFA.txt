[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Especially if there's no retirement plan for Putin.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.280]   Well, one of the things that's interesting from your book, there's
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.320]   things that are seen by one side as you're deterring the other side, often
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.240]   seen as the other side as a provocation, where the embargoes from the U.S. are
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.200]   seen as Japan as a deadline to attack people who are less sympathetic to the
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.320]   Ukrainian cause, I've said.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240]   Extending NATO, which we thought would be deterrence, was actually a
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.360]   provocation for Putin.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.120]   First of all, I think you should look at the people living in the countries in
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.760]   question.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.120]   So before we decide that we're the important people in the world, Americans
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840]   or we're in Britain now or Britons, and therefore anyone in between doesn't
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480]   count, I believe that's wrong.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.920]   So all of the countries that joined NATO desperately wanted to join NATO, right?
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.560]   And they've had a whole history of Russians doing terrible things to them.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.280]   I'm not making it up.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.320]   This is what Russia's been up to.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.080]   They have been correct that Russia is going to do more terrible things.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.640]   They were correct doing everything they could to get into NATO.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.840]   It's incredible in my lifetime, I'm remembering what the standards of living
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520]   of people in Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union had dominated and what it
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.400]   is now, since they have been freed of Soviet domination, it's been massive
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.440]   compounding of standards of living.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.680]   It's allowed people your age to travel the world, have a lot of aspirations in
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.880]   their lives, right?
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.240]   There's no podcasting.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.560]   But if when you talk about, oh, should we deny these things because we got some
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   egos in Russia that want to maintain a continental empire?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.040]   I cannot or you cannot change how Russians think about things, right?
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.840]   Russians have to, how they think about the things, that's their decision.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.640]   But if you look at Europe as a peninsula, you're better off with more
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.120]   insulation from Russia than not.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   But isn't this another case of not thinking in terms of both halves of the
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   court in tennis, where compared to the possibility of nuclear war, just nudging
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.280]   that number up and down matters far more than whether another country in Eastern
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800]   Europe gets to be part of NATO or not.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.280]   Well, I think what was hoped and hope has been said not to be a strategy.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.600]   The hope was that trying to get Russia to join the party, so trying to integrate
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.840]   their energy supplies into Europe, paying them good money for it, have them make
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.040]   lots of money on that, hoping that they would invest this into their road system,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.360]   which is lamentable, and hoping that they would invest this to cleaning out their
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.040]   business laws, which are, it's horrendous trying to run a business there.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.720]   As you watched right now, as different things get nationalized and taken over
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.920]   and different business leaders who are successful wind up unaccountably dropping
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.800]   at a sixth floor windows and things, or old people always seem to fall downstairs.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.160]   I think that's a special way of offing people.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.960]   That was the hope, is join the party because you will become wealthy too.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.320]   Russian standards of living have been stagnating for quite a while.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.920]   That Putin's model of basically taking over your neighbor's stuff and then
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   whatever, you have a bomb flat bringing home, it's not an efficient way to make
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.800]   wealth and you're killing so many people.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.320]   So I don't believe that we in the West have this denying people of Eastern
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.680]   Europe, saying, "Hey, well, actually, because the Russians have such an
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.040]   attitude, you get to be their serfs forever."
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.840]   I guess it's not that it's just, but there are broader considerations for the
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.600]   same reason that you were talking about earlier, that would not have made sense
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   for Americans, it would have not been plausible that we would have kept
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.720]   fighting further to prevent Eastern Europe at the time from succumbing to the
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.240]   Red Army.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.200]   The Ukrainians are doing the fighting right now.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.560]   Supplied by tremendous amounts of Western aid.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.600]   Yeah, they are.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.960]   But that's pennies on the dollar.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.240]   It's they're willing to fight for their country.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.680]   It's not about the cost to the United, it's not like the 40 billion or
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.120]   whatever, it's the, how does this nudge the nuclear war problem?
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.200]   Well, what's the nuclear war going to do, Putin?
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.560]   The Ukrainian forces are dispersed.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.240]   What's the target?
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.800]   It's going to be Kiev, I suppose?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.320]   Or, I don't know, he thinks that he's out of options.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.160]   So let's go bomb NATO headquarters or something.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.520]   I think the Chinese have whispered in his ear, and this is pure speculation,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.240]   is, "Buddy, if you do this, everybody on the planet is going to get nuclear
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.520]   weapons, and all of a sudden we aren't going to have this little small club of
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.200]   people with nuclear weapons, and the consequences are going to be rather
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.640]   horrendous."
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.160]   And also look at China, it has more nuclear armed neighbors than
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.120]   anyone on the planet.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.040]   And some of them are totally nuts.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.960]   Putin himself, right?
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.640]   I would think, "Oh, well, let's try North Korea for the country that's
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.560]   got starvation in the 21st century.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.800]   How did you do it?"
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.280]   Although on this point, another thing your books have emphasized is how often
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.520]   leaders make mistakes that make no strategic, make very little strategic
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.720]   sense and are very stupid.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.280]   You could imagine, even though it would be very stupid for Putin to escalate,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.240]   especially if he personally is going to be, you know, there's no retirement
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.800]   plan, I could imagine him doing very stupid things.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.560]   Well, let's put "stupid" out of it, because it's not explanatory by saying,
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.440]   "Well, someone's stupid," because it means you write off understanding their
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.960]   reasoning.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.120]   So a lot of Westerners, when they think of governments, think about governments
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   operating in the interest of their population.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.400]   So when their decisions don't improve standards of living, security, and
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.160]   things, then we say, "Those aren't good decisions."
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.520]   All right, but that's not the game.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.040]   In China, for instance, it's all about maintaining the monopoly of the Chinese
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.880]   Communist Party to rule.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.280]   And if that conflicts with having higher living standards, you better believe
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.680]   they're choosing Communist Party.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.640]   So you're watching those kinds of decisions going on right now where their
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.280]   most talented entrepreneurs are being relieved of their enterprises.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.280]   Or Putin, as you've said, he's made a pivotal error.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.240]   He has no back down plan.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.280]   He only has a double down plan.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.120]   Expect him to double down forever.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.440]   And then the question is whether all the oligarchs want to keep doubling down with
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.840]   him and his generals, or whether they, I don't know, give him something extra in
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.120]   his Cheerios some morning.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.680]   Who knows?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.560]   So I feel like this is one of the lessons you were actually talking about earlier,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.720]   where you don't want somebody to feel like they're up against the wall, where
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.320]   even if it would be an unjust sort of resolution, some sort of ceasefire, or
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.080]   Putin can stay face, I wonder if your sort of historical lessons would bring you to
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.720]   that conclusion.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   Oh, and Putin, he will be back for more and understand that that's just the case.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.280]   But then what is the solution?
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.960]   We can't have unconditional surrender.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.440]   No, no, no one's marching into Moscow.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.760]   Right.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   The United States has done this for many years, is you don't recognize the
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.120]   territories that he's taken, which means the Russians are stuck with a sanction
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.760]   regime of some type forever.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.400]   And you go, "Oh, well, that'll weaken.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.600]   Certain people won't adhere to it."
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.160]   It will depress Russian growth forever, which goes back to an earlier part of this
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.440]   conversation of it's really powerful.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   And it was some Russians who themselves, at the very beginning, said, "Oh, no, we
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.840]   are going to be like North Korea."
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.880]   Yeah, you will be.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.320]   That's exactly where he's heading them.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.720]   We don't control when the Russians reassess.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.000]   We can't even predict when or whether they'll reassess.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.280]   We can't predict whether there'll be some kind of incipient civil war in Russia,
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.960]   right, which would be, well, destabilizing by definition.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.520]   Who knows how that, who knows how that goes?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.240]   One of the things you asked me in email about is whether superior finances wins
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.200]   wars or something.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.000]   It's superior alliance systems that win wars.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.680]   And it's interesting that the Europeans, particularly the Eastern Europeans, are
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.880]   the leaders of all this.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.120]   And isn't it fascinating that the Finns and the Swedes, who forever were neutral,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.280]   are now all over this.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.120]   And they know.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.640]   So what is it?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.920]   The enemy gets a vote.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.440]   The Russians have a vote.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.360]   As long as the Russians are playing this game, our best bet is to support Ukrainians.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.800]   Because unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, where the locals did not do the bulk of the
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.480]   fighting, this is when the locals are.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.200]   And that's key on whether you also were emailing me and asking me about successful
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.440]   versus unsuccessful interventions.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:54.720]   When the locals do all the fighting, that's when your best starts are of helping them.
