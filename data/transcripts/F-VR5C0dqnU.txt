[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   I feel like I have two different personalities, one who's very productive and intentional,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   another who wants to be a slob, scroll social media, play video games and watch TV all day.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.600]   How do I stop falling into the slob state?
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.280]   Well, Fahad, it's a good question. It's not a original question. And I mean that in the
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.360]   good sense of your issue is not unusual. Your issue is not something very specific to you.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.160]   And in particular, your issue here has nothing to do with some sort of intrinsic character flaw
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.080]   that has been overcome. I think we often miss when we talk about tales of people who diligently and
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.720]   disciplinedly work through big accomplishments, we often miss the subtlety that goes into
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.680]   setting up a lifestyle or work environment in which you actually are able to maintain motivation
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.320]   and accomplish something big. That is a lot more subtle than we give credit to. It's not just about
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.200]   some people are able to white knuckle it and some people are weak. It's much more complicated than
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.960]   that. There's a couple of things I want to focus on here as being important. One has to do with
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.720]   how you choose what you work on. One has to do with how you build a lifestyle or approach actually
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.400]   working on it. So let's start with the choice question. And then the second piece will cover
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.440]   more. That's going to overlap more with the central theme of today's episode about cultivating
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.760]   discipline as a mindset. But let's start first with the choice of project. Oftentimes, especially
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.680]   for young people and for how you say here, you're 21 years old. So that that counts as you, you're
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.040]   half Jesse and I's age, which is its own psychological issue for Jesse and I to deal with.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.880]   But don't worry about that. For someone who's young like you, you have to be very careful in
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.480]   what you choose to work on. So there's a couple of things that is going to potentially short circuit
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.120]   your motivation. One is you just set too much stuff on your plate. Yeah, I'm going to do this
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.960]   and this and this because I can't wait to get started and I want to work on all these things.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   And I just want to get really motivated and go for it. And your mind gets exhausted and says,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.960]   we can't be starting a business and AC in our classes and writing a book and training to be
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.800]   in really good shape. It's just too many things. The energy involved in trying to keep up with
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.080]   these things is too much. And it just seems intractable and forget it. Motivation is gone.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920]   The other type of issue that happens here is that your mind, you maybe have one or two things. It's
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.000]   not the quantity, but your mind doesn't trust your plan for execution. You're like, yeah,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.480]   I want to look like Thor, but all you're doing is sort of just randomly going to the gym and
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.560]   sort of lifting weights. And your mind's like, you don't know what this is not going to lead
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.480]   the Thor. We're not going to look, we're just doing random stuff. Or you say, I want to be a
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.000]   famous writer and you're sort of writing every day. And your mind says, this is not how this works.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.320]   Just you're writing kind of random stuff or with no guidance, no structure.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.400]   What's going to happen with this? We're not going to become a famous writer doing this. So
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.560]   once your initial, just general excitement about being a writer dies off, we're going to withhold
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.280]   motivation. And then you're going to find yourself falling off. So being careful about how you choose
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.160]   what you work on a reasonable load, and then study what you work on and make sure that your plan for
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.080]   approaching it is evidence-based and logical that your mind will trust. Yeah, we're going to get
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.920]   results with what we're doing. And to get there, especially if you're young, might mean bringing
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   your ambition down and aiming at a much closer milestone. So it's not, I want the Pulitzer
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.040]   Prize. It's, I want to be a regular contributor to the college magazine. So you bring it down to a
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.000]   more proximate goal. You have a plan to get there that your mind trusts. So the choice of things
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.120]   matter if you want to have your motivation be sustained. All right. The second big category
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.320]   here comes to that mindset we talked about earlier during the deep dive earlier in the show.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   Does your mind think of yourself as someone who is able to handle and stick with internally
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.480]   motivated goals? It sounds like right now, no. So when I hear I get going, I'm reading you here,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.160]   I'm very productive and intentional. And then it sort of falls off and I become a slob.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.920]   If I had to guess this productivity and intentionality might be aimed in part at
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.240]   externally powered goals. You're working because you're very motivated about some particular
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.320]   outcome. You got yourself excited about it, watching YouTube videos or reading something,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.200]   and something got captured you and got your attention going. And that's what's motivating
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.000]   you to do the work, to return to the books, to return to putting in effort. And when that
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.040]   external power begins to dissipate, then social media TV comes back. So seeing yourself instead
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.200]   as someone who finds pride in sticking with internally powered goals, you're going to have
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.600]   less ups and downs. How do you do that? I'd go back to the deep life stack. I would start with
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.280]   the discipline layer. I would choose two to three daily disciplines covering a couple of different
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.200]   areas in your life that are non-trivial, but are also tractable and start marking on a sheet,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.480]   on a time block planner, on a calendar, on your wall, wherever you want to do it.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.440]   Did I do each of these each day? And really do that for a whole semester. Then return to,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.040]   okay, what's my more ambitious goals for what I'm gonna do with my time? You will find that
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.800]   it's easier to stick with it. Your mind is much more comfortable with, we believe in this,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.520]   these are carefully chosen. We stick with things even when they're hard. That is what Fahad does.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.640]   That is who we are. You change your self-conception by training your mind to think about what you're
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:26.320]   doing differently. All right. So there's nothing wrong about you Fahad. What's wrong is some of
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.240]   the details of your approach towards your very admirable goal of doing intentional,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.520]   remarkable things with your time. So choose carefully and spend some time developing
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.000]   a mindset of discipline, a comfort with internally powered goals. And I think you're going to find
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.560]   that this up and down whip sign between I'm working 10 hours a day and I'm on social media
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.000]   all day, that's going to start to even out. All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.480]   Okay. Next question is from Jacob, a 20 year old from Colorado. I seem to have contracted a case
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.840]   of what I call seasonal discipline, where I'll be very actively disciplined on following my habits
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.720]   and systems for a few months at a time, and then fall off really hard for a few months in an endless
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.920]   agonizing loop. I'm wondering if you have any tips for cultivating a more consistent commitment
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.800]   to discipline. You got a lot of young people today, Jesse.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   I know, I was thinking the same thing. Makes us feel old.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.400]   You know, when you were doing the Henson Reed, I was thinking, you know, you haven't shaved in two
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   days and I was like, mine, I go back and forth a lot, but mine's white now.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.520]   Oh, mine is too. Yeah.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.440]   Yeah. I don't mind it. I don't mind it, but my beard is, well, it's salt and pepper.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   But it's definitely white and I can see it at my sideburns as well. Yeah. My hair is still
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.920]   mainly brown, but, oh, that's coming. That's coming. We need to balance these 20 year old
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.360]   questions. I'm telling you, Jesse, next we'll get, I don't know, a 41 year old question is going to be
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.040]   like a combination of wanting to know about tax filing. You know, I'm doing my schedule C
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.400]   deductions and wondering if this is the right line item to put that deduction, some mixture of talking
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.720]   about, yeah, tax filings. And then also, I don't know what else to-
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.920]   Potential hair surgery.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.080]   And like, yeah, hair surgery. I'm thinking about getting like this hair surgery for
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.840]   that hair surgery. And I would kind of a tax question and also I'm tired all the time.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.240]   And I need to, should I get like testosterone treatment? Yeah. Meanwhile, these young kids
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.920]   are, yeah. I was up 12 hours, 20 hours straight working on my screenplay and we're like, I only
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.400]   get two hours of working in the morning before I fall asleep and take a nap. All right, Jacob,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.120]   I'm sorry. Let's get back to your question. Seasonal discipline. You, some periods do well,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.920]   some periods you do not so well. All right. Very similar to Fahad. So I'm going to have,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.080]   again, two solutions here where this is going to overlap with what I talked about with Fahad
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.600]   is just the mindset training piece. So the very same thing I recommended Fahad that I recommended
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.120]   at the beginning of the show, I'm going to recommend as a starting point for you as well,
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.600]   that discipline layer, that very first layer of the deep life stack. Two to three,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   non-trivial and tractable, non-trivial, but tractable daily disciplines covering multiple
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.360]   areas of your life that you track every single day and put most of your productivity, intentionality,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.680]   focus, all that willpower on just doing those every day, not breaking the chain. You want to
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.560]   mark it every day on a calendar. It's a good tune up just to get your mind back in shape as
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.480]   I don't need external power to do things. I don't need to be in a season where I'm excited or things
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.120]   are going well to make progress on important things. I can also make progress in the hard
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.760]   seasons, in the proverbial winters when other things are going on or the work itself is not
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.320]   going so well. So there's a mindset tune up and I think that returning to that discipline layer
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.160]   can help with that. And then just like with Fahad, but with slight differences in specifics here,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.800]   I would say, let's also think about what this, what you're calling here, habits and systems,
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.040]   what these habits and systems are. So even if you have the right internal conception of yourself,
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:14.080]   it is still the case that if the particular habits or systems you've put in place,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.120]   if those particular habits and systems aren't sustainable, or if they have a lot of friction,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.560]   they work, but they have overhead that don't need to be there and your mind senses that,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:31.200]   you are going to accumulate stress fractures, right? You're going to accumulate over time,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.040]   this friction and grinding of the system's not quite right. It's too big, it's too hard.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.160]   It has steps we don't need to do. It's like the system's going to start building up these
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   stretch fractures until the whole thing eventually breaks apart. And that's maybe why you can only
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.640]   make a few months. This is very common in the world of productivity systems, that if the system
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.160]   is not compatible with your life and streamlined and believable, you can last with it for a while.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.200]   But after, it gets this clunky, I'm typing these notes and it goes into this note system that then
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.720]   automatically populates these types of systems. And every day I have a generative AI bot take
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.040]   these and generate a schedule. And then I use that schedule to sort of schedule my hours.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.560]   These types of high overhead, high friction systems, they begin to just accumulate too much
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.400]   wear and tear until all of the gears get jammed. And then you just say enough with this and you
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.600]   fall back to doing nothing until doing nothing after a while gets you so stressed out or
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   overwhelmed by being disorganized that you go and build a new system. And that starts generating
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.760]   friction until its gears mesh. And then that could also be the source of what you're seeing here.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.240]   One season up, one season down, one season up, one season down. So you also want to really check
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.360]   out your systems here, streamline them. The simplest possible thing that actually helps you
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.880]   get your work done sometimes is the right thing to do. Get rid of unnecessary things, have a core
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.440]   document where you keep track of here's what I do and how I do it. So you're not just trying to keep
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.200]   track of things in your mind and you can see where there's overlap or redundancies or your systems
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.080]   are sort of out of control. You want something that fits very naturally into your life. So if
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.720]   you're starting from scratch here, I would say something like multi-scale planning. You have
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.120]   a strategic plan, a weekly plan and do some sort of daily time block plan during work days, but not
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.320]   the weekends. Have some sort of good system for capture of your tasks so that you don't have to
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.800]   keep track of those things in your head. Put those two things together, maybe mixed in with some sort
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.000]   of fixed schedule productivity mindset of this is my work hours and everything else has to fit into
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.600]   it. That's a good start for organizing all the professional things in your life. Use very simple
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.680]   tech tools for implementing this. I'm talking, you know, you have a paper time block planner
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.960]   and then a couple of Google Docs to keep track of strategic plans and weekly plans. You could
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.280]   use Trello to keep track of tasks or even just a long text file where you're typing things.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   Simple technologies that are easy to get in and easy to get out that you can access from multiple
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.920]   platforms. That makes a big difference as you add in other structures or goals around your personal
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.160]   life. Keep it simple, you know? So again, let's go for simplicity, accessibility. Let's try to
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.800]   minimize friction. Let's just make the general rhythm of your life something that's very
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.840]   sustainable. That'll help too. So I don't know in your case, Jacob, which is the bigger problem.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.120]   So I don't know if it's a mindset issue, that your systems are fine, but your mindset just
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.680]   needs right now, external fuel for you to work on hard things. Or if it's a systems problem,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.960]   your mindset's fine, but your systems have too much friction. So look at both. But between those
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:34.000]   two things, I think you're going to find the seasonality of following systems is going to go
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.840]   away. One epilogue I will add to this as well is don't reject seasonality outright as an issue.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.840]   I think it's an issue if your systems are seasonal. I stop being organized during some
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.280]   months versus others. I think it's completely fine if your workload is seasonal. In fact,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.360]   in my new book, Slow Productivity, which is coming out in March, there's a whole principle
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.920]   is about working at a natural pace and it really gets into seasonality and how natural and well
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.560]   suited humans are for that. So I do want to throw that in there. You might just be getting exhausted,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.240]   right? Like a professor, by the time a professor gets to the end of spring, traditionally,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.480]   they're exhausted because they've gone through a full school year. So to actually pull back some
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.080]   in the summer makes sense because you need to recharge. If you try to go all out in the summer
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.040]   after a hard spring and after a hard fall before that, you might just run out of steam altogether.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.400]   So I think seasonal workload could be fine as well. So let's throw that in here,
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.000]   not just as an epilogue, but I'm going to throw this in, Jacob, as my third part of my answer.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.440]   Make your workload seasonal, but keep the systems the same. You're still multi-scale planning,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.280]   but when you get to some months of the year, the amount of stuff you're putting into your week,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.960]   the complexity of your daily time block schedules are much easier. And you get that relief of,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.360]   man, this feels great. I can really control my time. I'm taking Thursdays completely off because
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.960]   why not? I'm using planning so I can move pieces around. This is great. I can actually extract a
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.120]   lot more relaxation and recharging because I have some structure. So I think a seasonal workload
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   could be excellent, but you don't want your systems to come and go seasonally. And you want
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   to make sure that your mindset is one that doesn't require external power. So there we go. I
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.360]   upgraded this from two parts to three parts, Jacob, and hopefully you will find that useful.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:17.200]   All right. Let's keep going here, Jesse. Yeah. And then the time management video on our YouTube
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.440]   channel is definitely something you should check out. Yeah. So look under the, what's it,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.800]   core ideas is the playlist. Right. So youtube.com/calnewportmedia. Look at the playlist.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.480]   There's a playlist called core ideas. There's one titled, a video titled time management,
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.240]   where I talk about that multi-scale multi-scale planning. Yeah. It shows up, shows up right in
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.080]   there. It's a good place to start is something interesting. This is where we talk about
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.560]   something interesting that you, my listeners have sent into my interesting@calnewport.com
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:56.160]   email address. So I want to load my password. So I'm going to load up now a short post that
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.080]   one of you sent in that I thought was interesting. Okay. So here we go. Here's the post. This was
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:10.320]   posted on, I suppose, LinkedIn. I have it up on the screen. So if you're watching youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.240]   episode 256 or the deep life.com episode 256. All right. This is about Harrison Ford. I thought this
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.880]   was appropriate because there's a new Indiana Jones movie in the theater. So I'll be taking
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.600]   my boys to shortly. Here's what this post says before he was Han Solo or Indiana Jones, Harrison
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.040]   Ford was a carpenter in 1964, Ford moved to Hollywood to become an actor, but I arrived on a
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.320]   metaphoric bus full of people who had the same ambition, he said. So he came up with this plan
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.480]   to prevail over the competition. As Ford spent time around the other aspiring actors on that
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.160]   metaphoric bus, he became aware of something. Most of them were in a hurry. They're in a hurry to
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.120]   make it or to make lots of money or to prove something to someone, whatever the reason most
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.360]   run a tight timeline. So forms plan was to do the opposite, the length of his timeline to do so.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.000]   Ford said, I had to have another source of income. So I became a carpenter by doing carpentry. He
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.320]   explained, I was able to wait it out as the years went by the attrition rate eliminated many of
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.520]   those people from the competition pool until finally there are only a few of us left on the
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.720]   bus from the entering class. I always saw life that way. You just have to find a way to stick
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.480]   it out to prevail. All right. I like that story because it's a great vignette of slow productivity
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   in action. There's something that's both effective and sustainable by working on a small number of
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   things over a long period of time consistently. This is the definition of internal powered goals.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.000]   The theme that unifies this episode. I'm sticking with this, even if I'm not excited about it every
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.120]   moment, even if my motivation goes up and down, even if my success or failures have periods where
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.360]   one is big and the other's down and that's flops back and forth. I'm going through a hard period.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.280]   Now I consistently make progress and not just working blindly, but really getting feedback,
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.120]   adjusting. You can imagine Harrison Ford struggling with roles early on, pivoting when he sees a
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.520]   different type of role, seeing he's a special type of training. It's this relentless return.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.440]   What can I improve here? What's not working? How can I adjust my trajectory? You're making
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   adjustments. You're letting evidence come in. You're learning more, but forward momentum always,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.240]   always continues steps every day. So you're moving in the right direction, adjusting your path,
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.120]   always moving. This more often than not is what unlocks really interesting impact and
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.240]   interesting opportunities. A slow productivity approach, a small number of things that through
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:42.640]   internal power, you keep pursuing over time, just relentlessly. I'm sticking with this, updating how
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.760]   I do it, but sticking with it over time. Small number of things done really well, reasonable,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.200]   sustainable pace really is, I think a very sustainable strategy for a deep life, a very
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.560]   sustainable strategy for eventually doing, achieving deep accomplishments. So I thought
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.320]   that was a good story to end on. Productivity doesn't have to be fast. Productivity doesn't
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.080]   require constant intakes of motivation, inspiration. Productivity doesn't require
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:17.360]   these 10 hour YouTube productivity, YouTuber style, binges of I'm just out white knuckling
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.280]   everyone else. Sometimes it's as boring as Harrison Ford said, I'm just going to take my time and keep
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.320]   working on this craft, taking feedback, adjust, taking feedback, adjust, having a second trade
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.160]   to support myself until finally American graffiti happens. Then Star Wars happens, then Indiana
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.800]   Jones happens and the whole thing breaks open. So sometimes slowing down is the right way to actually
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.280]   make it farther down the path as paradoxical as that can seem.
