[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.020]   The words to which I shall like to call your attention this evening have to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the eighth chapter and the thirty-fifth verse.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.020]   The thirty-fifth verse in the eighth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:27.020]   "Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:35.020]   Now I must read some of the previous verses in order that you all may be quite clear and happy about this context.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:46.020]   We are dealing here once more with this incident that is recorded here in the second half of this eighth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:00.020]   where we are given an account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch, this man who was behaving and acting as the treasurer of the queen of the Ethiopians,
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.020]   and who had been up to Jerusalem to worship, but now he was returning.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:18.020]   And Philip has been told, Philip the evangelist has been told by an angel of God to go onto a certain road leading down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.020]   And he doesn't quite know why, but there he suddenly sees why he's been sent.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.020]   He sees this man sitting in his chariot reading the Esaias the prophet.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.020]   "Then the spirit said unto Philip, go near and join thyself to this chariot."
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.020]   And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, "Understandest thou what thou readest?"
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.020]   And he said, "How can I, except some men should guide me?"
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.020]   And he desired, Philip, that he would come up and sit with him.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:05.020]   The place of the scripture which he read was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb done before his shepherd, so opened he not his mouth.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.020]   In his humiliation his judgment was taken away, and who shall declare his generation?
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.020]   For his life is taken from the earth."
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:26.020]   And the eunuch answered Philip and said, "I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other men?"
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:35.020]   Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him, "Jesus."
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:43.020]   Now we take a further step in our study of this man's conversion, because that is what the account deals with.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:53.020]   It's a very important matter. It's a part of the general history of the spread of the gospel, and the spread of the Christian church at the beginning.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.020]   Starting in Jerusalem, as was inevitable, it then began to spread out through Judea, and now down to Samaria.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:09.020]   But here is yet another step. Here is the first African that we know of that became a Christian.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.020]   So it's a very interesting and important incident judged from any standpoint whatsoever.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.020]   But we are interested in it not merely from that historical angle, we are interested in it in that way.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.020]   For let us remember, the history of the church is all important.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.020]   The church didn't begin in this century, you know. The Christian church is very old.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.020]   And it's important that we should realize that, and therefore be clear about the history.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.020]   I say that because I would emphasize again this fact that most of the troubles, it seems to me, about the Christian faith,
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.020]   and about the Christian church at the present time, arise from the fact that people divorce themselves from history.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.020]   They seem to think that they know what Christianity is. They dismiss the past.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.020]   And they set up their own ideas and conceptions. And of course they're quite wrong, and in any case it's dishonest.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.020]   As the church is historical and has a continuous history, it is our duty, if we would be concerned about these things
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   and understand them at all, it is our duty, I say, to be aware of the history.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:25.020]   And that is one of our reasons, therefore, for going back to this history here at the beginning of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:38.020]   But in addition to that, we are particularly concerned to do this because this is, after all, the standard and the pattern and the norm with respect to these matters.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   Would you know what Christianity is? Well, come back here. Would you know what the church is? Come back here.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   Would you know what a Christian is? Look at these people. And especially, would you know how one becomes a Christian?
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.020]   Now that is the peculiar thing that is dealt with in this particular story.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:10.020]   I pointed out last Sunday night, I must say it again, lest I be misunderstood, there are differences in the details in the ways in which people become Christian.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:22.020]   Every story is not identical. But, though there are differences in these details, there are certain fundamental things that are invariably present.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   There are certain things which are absolutes, and without which one is not a Christian at all.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:36.020]   Now this is very necessary for this reason. If you look at the Christian in general, you might think that he is very similar to certain other people.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.020]   Some of the devotees of the cults and people like that.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:48.020]   How do you tell the difference between a Christian and a man who, on the surface, looks very similar to him as the result of some other teaching?
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:58.020]   Well, there is only one answer to that. And that is that the Christian always conforms to and corresponds to what we find here.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:09.020]   And that is why it is essential that we should emphasize these common basic principles that are invariably present in the case of the Christian.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:17.020]   And that is what we are doing as we analyze this case. Now, let me show you the point at which we've arrived.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.020]   Why is it that there are so many people in the world who are not Christian?
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.020]   And especially at a time like this, with the world in such trouble.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:35.020]   The answer is that they stumble at certain difficulties, and we've been examining these one by one as they're put before us here.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.020]   Now, the first was the whole question of the supernatural.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.020]   You see, if you don't believe in the supernatural, you cannot be a Christian. It's impossible.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.020]   Now, there's nothing to stop people believing in the supernatural.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.020]   People say, "I can't believe in the supernatural." What they really mean is, "I don't believe."
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.020]   There's nothing to stop you. There's no knowledge that stops you.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.020]   Because those of us who believe in the supernatural have got the same knowledge as you've got.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.020]   But people do stumble at it. They've decided to rule out the supernatural altogether.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   No angel, no God, nothing beyond men, nothing beyond the world, nothing beyond the scene.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.020]   Well, that's a fatal obstacle.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.020]   Well, then we went on to consider another, and that was the danger of confusing Christianity with religion.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.020]   And those men, of course, is particularly instructive at that point.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.020]   Here is a man who, having been brought up in pagan religion, changes it for the Jews' religion.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.020]   But still, he hasn't found what he was looking for. Religion will never satisfy.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.020]   It is essential that we know the difference between religion and the Christian faith.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.020]   And then last Sunday night, we went a step further.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   And this is the most important point. The character, the nature, the type of the Christian truth.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.020]   This is a cause of endless stumbling.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.020]   People persist in coming to this as if it were a human subject.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.020]   As if it were in line and in series with men's interests.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.020]   The things that men can apply his mind to, and he sits in judgment upon them and investigates them.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.020]   That's absolutely fatal here.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   That's what we dealt with last Sunday night.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.020]   "How can I?" says this man.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.020]   "Do you understand what you read?" said Philip to him.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.020]   And he very honestly says, "How can I? I don't understand. Of course I don't.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   How can I accept someone, some men should guide me?"
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:52.020]   Here it is, the utter impossibility of the natural and aided human mind to comprehend the message of the gospel.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.020]   And if you're trying to understand it and say, "I don't understand this and therefore I don't believe it."
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.020]   Well, you still remain not a Christian.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.020]   Now all these are what I would call preliminary difficulties.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   Those are the difficulties that beset us in the mere introduction.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.020]   But they're very vital.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.020]   These things are axiomatic.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.020]   This is supernatural.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.020]   This is divine.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.020]   This is Christianity.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.020]   This is something beyond men's comprehension.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.020]   That's the character of the truth.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.020]   That's the realm with which we are dealing.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.020]   And it's altogether different from everything we know in the world.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.020]   You see, our Lord summed it all up by putting it like this.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:52.020]   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   It's an absolute essential.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   And without that, we cannot proceed at all.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   Very well.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   Now then, that brings us to the next step.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:08.020]   If that is the character of this truth, what is its content?
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.020]   What is really the nature of this message?
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:18.020]   Now that's the thing that this 35th verse brings before us in a very striking manner this evening.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   We are now going to examine the content of this truth.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.020]   No longer its general character, but its specific message.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.020]   And this is clearly quite crucial.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.020]   Now they're coming to the point together.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.020]   Philip has entered the chariot.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.020]   The work is really now beginning.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.020]   The preliminaries have ended.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.020]   They've been dealt with.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   And here we come now to the actual message of the gospel.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.020]   And I want to consider it with you this evening in terms of this 35th verse.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:59.020]   Which gives us, again, a very wonderful key to the understanding of all the difficulties that so many people find
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.020]   in connection with this matter of believing and accepting the Christian faith.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.020]   Now you notice what this verse tells us.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:17.020]   "Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus."
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   Now you notice that I emphasize the word "began".
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   And that's what I want to put before you.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.020]   Where Philip began and what he proceeded to do.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   These things are of vital importance and let me put it to you therefore in this way.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.020]   What's the difference between the Ethiopian eunuch and Philip?
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   I suppose if you analyze them from the standpoint of ability,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.020]   it might very well be the case that the Ethiopian eunuch was the abler man of the two.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:54.020]   Most of these early leaders of the Christian faith, as you're familiar with the fact,
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.020]   were untrained men.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.020]   Derived by the Sanhedrin as unlearned and ignorant men.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.020]   And doubtless Philip was that sort of man.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:12.020]   Who hadn't had the educational advantages of this great treasurer at the court of the Ethiopian queen.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:18.020]   And wasn't as well versed in philosophy and things like that and in human learning and law.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.020]   Well, I don't know, but probably what I'm saying is the truth.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   But I'm asking what's the difference between two men?
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   Here is a man, you see, this great eunuch.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.020]   He's bought these scriptures in Jerusalem and he's reading them there in his chariot
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   because he wants to know, but he doesn't understand.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:42.020]   And Philip approaches him in the way we've seen and puts his question.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.020]   And the man immediately detects something about Philip.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.020]   So he desired, Philip, that he would come up and sit with him.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:57.020]   And Philip, now we are told, opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.020]   What's the difference between the two men?
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.020]   Why is it Philip can help him?
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.020]   How is it that Philip can help him?
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.020]   Philip was in no difficulty.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.020]   The Ethiopian eunuch is in tremendous difficulty.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.020]   What's the difference?
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.020]   Now the thing that strikes us at once is this.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   That Philip had no problem here.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.020]   The thing that was perplexing the other men and said nothing to him, in spite of all his learning and so on,
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.020]   Philip can deal with and Philip can explain to him.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.020]   Why is that? What's the difference?
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.020]   Well, this is, you see, these are some again of these most essential points.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.020]   Philip at once begins, and he begins to expound.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.020]   What does he expound?
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.020]   Well, it's clear.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   He was expounding a very definite message.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.020]   Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.020]   Told him the good news about Jesus.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.020]   That's what it really means.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   In other words, Philip was in no difficulty because he'd got a message.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:08.020]   He knew exactly what it was and he was able to state it.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.020]   Now here you see again some of these fundamental points.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   What is a Christian?
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.020]   Well, here he is in the person of Philip.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.020]   He's a man who knows what he believes.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.020]   And he can tell somebody else exactly what it is.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.020]   Let's get this clear, my friends.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.020]   A Christian is not a man who is seeking and searching after the truth.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.020]   That's been the whole tragedy, especially of this present century.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.020]   A Christian has been represented as a seeker.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.020]   A man who goes out on a great intellectual quest.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.020]   He's a man who dabbles in philosophy and he's seeking, wanting to know.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   That's the opposite of a Christian.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.020]   A Christian is not seeking.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.020]   He's a man who's found.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.020]   He's a man who knows.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.020]   The thing is so monstrous it's such an utter contradiction.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.020]   You see, if the Christian is but a seeker, Philip wouldn't have been able to help this man.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.020]   All he could have said and done when he got into the chariot was to say this.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.020]   Well, I see that you are seeking and searching for the truth.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.020]   You know, I am also.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.020]   Shall we do it together?
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.020]   Let's have a look at it together now and see if we can make something of it.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.020]   You know, I've been struggling myself and I see you are.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.020]   And now we'll all go on together and see if we can find it.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.020]   A great intellectual quest.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.020]   And the books come tumbling out week after week.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.020]   An insight, a new view.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.020]   Oh, what utter rubbish it is.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.020]   What an utter travesty of the Christian faith.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.020]   Now, now.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:43.020]   We start then with this definition that the Christian message is a clear one.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.020]   It's a plain one.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:55.020]   It's one that can be stated simply, directly, and in terms that can be followed and that can be understood.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:01.020]   Now again, you see, I'm urging this point for this reason.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:08.020]   That there has been current once more in this century this idea that Christianity cannot be defined.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:13.020]   That it's something very beautiful and very wonderful but you can't put it into words.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.020]   Something, they say, you can feel but you can never state it.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.020]   This has been most popular in this present century.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:25.020]   This is sometimes what is called mysticism.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.020]   But it is some sensation, some feeling, some kind of attitude.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.020]   But you can't say what it is.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.020]   You can't put it into words.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.020]   You can't describe it.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:40.020]   I've often dealt with this from this pulpit because it's been such a common attitude in this present century.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:45.020]   But you see, this is again the exact opposite of the case and of the truth.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.020]   The Christian message is a perfectly clear message.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.020]   It's a well-defined message.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.020]   It can be stated in propositions and in categories.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.020]   Now, are we all clear about this?
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.020]   There's something almost ludicrous about the way in which people behave.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:11.020]   I've known men who've taken this modern view of the Christian message of the Christian faith
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.020]   and have talked in this vague, mystical way about it.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.020]   And then in their churches on Sunday, they solemnly get up and invite people to join with them
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.020]   in reciting the Apostles' Creed.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:29.020]   And perhaps the Athanasian Creed or the Nicene Creed.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.020]   You see the contradiction?
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.020]   In their sermon, in their speaking, they've said Christianity can't be defined.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.020]   It's a vague sensation. It's a feeling a man gets.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.020]   It's something wonderful.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.020]   There was a slogan a few years back that put it like this.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.020]   Christianity is caught, not taught.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.020]   Caught, you see, it's a spirit you catch.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   A spirit of fellowship. A spirit of mutual help and aid.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.020]   But it's caught. It's something you get.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.020]   You mix with people and you catch it from them.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.020]   But you can't state it. You can't define it. It's not taught.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   Now that is the exact opposite of the truth, you see.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.020]   And so people contradict themselves.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.020]   For what are these creeds?
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.020]   They're just statements of the truth.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.020]   They're definitions.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.020]   They are propositions.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:15.020]   All the great creeds were drawn up for this one reason.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:21.020]   That owing to certain false teachings, the people in the early church have become confused.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.020]   And they were beginning to say, well then, what is the truth?
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.020]   What is the Christian faith?
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.020]   Is it this or is it that?
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   Well, the fathers of the church were led, I believe, by the Spirit of God to meet together in great councils.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.020]   And they were guided and directed by the Spirit.
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.020]   And they drew up these creeds.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.020]   And in the creeds they said, it is this and it isn't that.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   They described it. They defined it.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.020]   It can be done.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.020]   You needn't be in any doubt as to what the Christian faith is.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.020]   You needn't be in any doubt as to whether you are a Christian.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.020]   It is a concrete, well-defined truth that can be stated in propositions.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.020]   It can be contrasted with error and with heresy and that which is wrong.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:05.020]   Now all that comes out here, Philip immediately expounds it to him.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.020]   We must be perfectly clear, I say, about this.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.020]   This is a point that is made constantly in the New Testament.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:20.020]   All these apostles and preachers preached exactly the same message.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   You didn't have in the early church what you've got today.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   They all preached the same message.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.020]   The apostle Paul often uses this as an argument.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.020]   He says the message that I preach, the others are preaching also.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.020]   There is no difference between the seasons.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.020]   We are all saying exactly the same thing.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.020]   And they were. There was no question about this.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.020]   And that is why when somebody began to say something else,
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.020]   they could look at him and tell the people not to listen to him.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.020]   And indeed they put this very strongly at times.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.020]   You remember how the apostle Paul puts it, for instance,
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.020]   in writing to Timothy in his second epistle and in the second chapter and the eighth verse.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:08.020]   There were certain false teachers who had gone around saying that the resurrection was passed already
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   and casting doubt upon the truth.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   Paul says to Timothy, look here, don't be disturbed by these things.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   My gospel.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.020]   Is this conceit? Is this arrogance? No, no.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.020]   What he means by my gospel is the gospel.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.020]   How is he so sure it's the right one?
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.020]   The answer is that he never created it.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.020]   It wasn't his good idea.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.020]   He had received it.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.020]   And all the other apostles had received it.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:48.020]   But the apostle Paul, you remember, goes even further in writing to the Galatians.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:54.020]   Here again were the members of the church, of the churches of Galatia.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.020]   They'd been troubled by certain false teachers who'd insinuated themselves amongst them
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.020]   and were bringing in heretical teaching.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   Do you remember what Paul says to them? Listen to this.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:16.020]   Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.020]   let him be accursed.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.020]   Now what a statement, what a strong statement.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   Says Paul, if I ever come to you again and deny what I've already told you,
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   or if an angel from heaven should appear before you and contradict what I have said to you,
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.020]   let him be accursed, let him be cursed.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.020]   How does he dare say such a thing?
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.020]   There's only one answer.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.020]   He knows exactly what the gospel is.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.020]   There's no difficulty, there is no question.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:55.020]   They conquest every teacher that appears amongst them by the gospel that he, Paul, had already delivered to them,
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.020]   and through believing which they had become Christians and had entered into the Christian church.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.020]   Very well then, my friends, here is the first thing that's obvious about Philip.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.020]   Philip enters into the chariot.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   He's not in difficulties, he's not nervous, and he's not saying to himself,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.020]   "What shall I say to this man, because I really don't know myself, but I'm hoping..."
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.020]   No, he enters with confidence, he knows exactly what he's got to say.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.020]   Because he's got this message, which all these people have got.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:29.020]   And the second thing that is equally obvious about Philip is this, isn't it?
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   That he had received that enlightenment which the Holy Spirit alone can give,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:42.020]   which enables the men both to understand this message and to be able to preach it and to teach it to others.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.020]   That is the difference between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.020]   Very well.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.020]   Now there is the first thing.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   Philip, you see, has got authority.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.020]   He's not uncertain, he's not frightened, he's not hesitant.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:59.020]   He enters and he begins, he opens his mouth and he's glad of the opportunity.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.020]   He's got it, he can do it, he can give it.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.020]   He's got authority.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.020]   That brings me to the second question, which is this.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   What is this authority based upon, or whence does it derive?
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.020]   And here it is, again, as plain as anything can be.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:29.020]   This is an authority which is derived alone from the Scriptures, if you like, from the Bible.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.020]   At that time, of course, they hadn't got the New Testament, they'd only got the Old Testament.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.020]   But that was enough.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.020]   But now we've got the New Testament as well.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.020]   Now Philip's only authority is the Scriptures.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.020]   This man was reading one of them, the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.020]   But this is the only authority, and Philip deals with this.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   Now this, again, is most vital.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.020]   What is this Christian message?
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:02.020]   The first thing we've got to be perfectly clear about is this.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   That it isn't any human thought or concoction.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.020]   Did you notice how Peter put it in that second epistle of his?
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:16.020]   "We have not followed cunningly devised fables,
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:21.020]   when we made known unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.020]   Look here, says Peter, I'm reminding you of the things I've told you.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.020]   He was becoming old, he knew he was about to die.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.020]   He says, "I'm going to go on repeating these things unto you,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.020]   so that after my decease, after I've gone, you may remember these things I've told you.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:42.020]   Because we have not declared unto you cunningly devised fables."
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.020]   Now that's what man does, isn't it?
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.020]   Man concocts his theories.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.020]   He may put it in the form of stories or allegories.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.020]   He may put it in the form of poetry.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.020]   Doesn't matter, it's always a cunningly devised fable.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.020]   Something that he's produced.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.020]   That's what philosophy is, it's speculation.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:04.020]   It's clever, cunningly devised, oh yes, there's no difficulty about that.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:09.020]   And very plausible and very wonderful when you look at it on the surface.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.020]   But that isn't what the preacher has.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.020]   That isn't what Philip had to do and to give.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.020]   That isn't what Peter has.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:21.020]   He says, "Listen, it is not cunningly devised fable.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.020]   It's something else.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.020]   But let's observe these negatives."
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:34.020]   So Philip, you see, didn't just go and talk to the eunuch and have a discussion.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.020]   Sorry, it's dialogue it's called now.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:43.020]   With him, dialogue about this problem and this situation and have an exchange of views.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.020]   The Ethiopian saying, "Well, it seems to me like this."
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.020]   "Well, I don't quite see it like that," says Philip.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.020]   And they begin to speculate about life and its meaning and what's happening and all the rest of it.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.020]   No, no.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.020]   It's teacher pupil.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.020]   A man who doesn't know listening and the other men speaking with authority.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   But secondly, let me point out this.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:11.020]   The message of the gospel is not merely a relation of experience.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.020]   Now, let's be clear about this.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.020]   What did Philip do on this occasion?
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:21.020]   Well, you know, what so many, it seems to me, would do today is something like this.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.020]   Being invited to join this man in the chariot.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.020]   Philip would have said to him, "Well, I see you're looking rather troubled."
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   "You're looking rather unhappy."
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   "You're looking rather miserable."
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.020]   "You know, I was once like that."
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.020]   "I've been like that."
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.020]   "But, you know, I'm no longer like that."
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.020]   "I've had a marvelous experience."
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.020]   "And I'm absolutely different now."
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.020]   Of course, he could have said all that. That was true of Philip.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.020]   But my point is that that isn't what he said.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.020]   Philip didn't sit down by the side of the Ethiopian eunuch and give him his experience.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.020]   Relate the story of his conversion to him and talk about it and end with that.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.020]   No, no.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.020]   Let's be clear about this.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.020]   Christian people are at fault at this point sometimes.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.020]   In always talking about themselves and experience.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.020]   That is not the preaching of the gospel.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.020]   That is not evangelism.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.020]   We've got to be very careful about this.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.020]   Some people are always relating their mystical experiences.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.020]   Philip didn't do that.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.020]   Others are telling about this great change that took place in their lives and saying,
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.020]   "You can get this. I want you to get it."
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.020]   "What's happened to me can happen to you."
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.020]   This is all involved. This is true of the Christian.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.020]   But that isn't how one becomes a Christian.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.020]   Philip didn't give his experience merely.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:42.020]   And his great concern, his primary concern,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.020]   was not so much that anything should happen to these men
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.020]   as that he should come face to face with the truth
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   that could do for him everything that he needed.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   So I emphasize these negatives.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.020]   What did Philip do?
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:00.020]   Well, what he did, of course, is what the preacher should always do.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.020]   He expounded the scriptures to him.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.020]   Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.020]   and preached unto him Jesus.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.020]   He starts with a passage that the man was reading and he works it out for him.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.020]   He shows him what it means.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.020]   In other words, Philip was not giving his own opinions
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.020]   about life and death and eternity to these men.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.020]   He was dealing with the scripture that was there in front.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.020]   Now, here is the point I'm establishing.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   This is our only authority.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.020]   I have no other authority as I stand in this pulpit.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.020]   The authority of the cults is the authority of experience.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   They talk about experience.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   They recommend experience.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   That's what they've got to offer.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.020]   That's not the case here.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   This is exposition of the truth.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   And we have no other authority.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.020]   My dear friends, let me put it as plainly and as simply as this.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:08.020]   Standing in this pulpit tonight, on the 28th of January, 1968,
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.020]   I am doing nothing different from what Philip did with the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.020]   "But wait a minute," you say.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   "Surely the position is not identical now with what it was in the first century?
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:23.020]   Surely all the knowledge that's been gathered, all the advances in science,
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.020]   all that man has produced, is all this nothing?"
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.020]   I don't hesitate to assert it.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   It is absolutely nothing.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.020]   I have no advantage over Philip. None at all.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:41.020]   The modern Christian has no advantage over the Christian of the first century.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.020]   None at all.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:50.020]   Why? Well, because we all have the sole authority of the scriptures.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.020]   We know nothing apart from this.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.020]   Modern philosophy doesn't help me. Modern science doesn't help me.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.020]   It doesn't even hinder me. It leads me exactly where I am.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.020]   The great fundamental questions have never changed.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.020]   They're still there, the same problems as the Ethiopian eunuch has,
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.020]   the modern man has, and the same is the answer.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.020]   There is no difference.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:17.020]   You see, we are dealing with the authority of the scriptures.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.020]   Why do I say that this is our only authority?
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.020]   Well, I answer like this.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:29.020]   I've already showed you that human understanding and philosophy doesn't help us.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.020]   So that's no authority.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.020]   Why do I say that this is the authority?
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:39.020]   The answer is that it claims to be God's Word.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.020]   This makes a unique claim.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.020]   It claims to be a revelation from God.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   In other words, this book must be put into a category that is different from all others.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.020]   All others are the production of men.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.020]   They may be able men, they may be great men.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.020]   They may be men who are great poets and have poetic inspiration.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.020]   They may have unusual insight as philosophers.
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.020]   All right, grant them anything you like.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.020]   Still, they're only men.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.020]   They are seeking, they are searching, they are trying to find.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.020]   That's the highest they can ever do.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:18.020]   Here is something that starts on an entirely different basis.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:24.020]   It claims to be a revelation from God.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.020]   It's a unique book.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.020]   It is a book that is in a category entirely on its own.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.020]   Now this is the claim that is made for it everywhere.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.020]   That is why I do what Philip did.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.020]   That's why I don't stand up here and then tell you a few stories
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.020]   or try to affect you by having different colored lights
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   and using psychological means and mechanisms
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.020]   and having appropriate singing and so on to get results
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.020]   and to make you feel happier.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.020]   That would be a travesty of my task.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.020]   My task is that of Philip.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.020]   I've got a book and here it is open.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.020]   And I say, "Do you understand it?"
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.020]   You say, "I don't very well."
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.020]   "Listen," I say.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   Why do I say that this is the word of God?
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:09.020]   Well, I do so because these men themselves say it.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.020]   You'll find your old prophets in the Old Testament all saying it.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.020]   They didn't say it just at a brilliant idea.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.020]   What they say is, "The word of God came unto me."
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.020]   And it came in a remarkable manner.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.020]   And they knew it was God speaking.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.020]   Some of them, like Jeremiah, will tell you at times
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.020]   that they didn't want to deliver the message.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.020]   They knew it would get them into trouble.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.020]   But God was speaking and the pressure was upon them.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   They felt it in their bones and they had to say it, come what may.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.020]   And Jeremiah was thrown into a dungeon for doing it.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.020]   Others were put to death. It didn't matter.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.020]   God had given them a word.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.020]   They couldn't understand it at times.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.020]   Themselves, they were the mouthpiece of God
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.020]   and they had to speak in spite of consequences.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.020]   That's what they say.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:56.020]   And do you notice what they say in the New Testament?
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:01.020]   Did you notice what Peter says about prophecy?
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:07.020]   He said, "Prophecy came not in old time by the will of men."
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:12.020]   But holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.020]   He said, "I'd have you understand that no prophecy of the Scripture
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.020]   is of any private interpretation."
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.020]   You see what he's saying is this.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.020]   He said, "Now look here, you good people.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.020]   I haven't long to be with you."
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.020]   Christ had given him an intimation that his end was at hand quite clearly.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   He says, "I'm soon going to put off this, my tabernacle.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.020]   I'm going to die, but I want you to hold on to what you've heard from me."
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.020]   "On what grounds does he do this? Is this, I ask again, just arrogance?"
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.020]   "Of course it isn't." He says, "Listen.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:44.020]   We haven't declared unto you cunningly devised fables."
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.020]   And then he tells them what happened.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.020]   He says, "I remember a day when James and John and I
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.020]   were taken up by the Lord onto the top of a certain mountain.
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.020]   And there a most amazing thing happened.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.020]   A cloud gathered in the brightness
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.020]   and suddenly he was changed in our very presence.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.020]   He began to glisten. His very clothes began to shine.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.020]   A radiance came streaming from his face.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.020]   We'd never seen anything like it.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.020]   We were almost blinded by the sight.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.020]   And we heard a voice from heaven saying,
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.020]   'This is my well-beloved, only begotten Son
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:28.020]   in whom I am well pleased.'"
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.020]   "Listen," says Peter, "I'm not asking you to listen to me.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.020]   I'm not asking you to believe these things because I, Peter, am saying them to you.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   Listen. I have heard the voice from heaven.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.020]   I am an eyewitness of his majesty.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.020]   I have heard the voice from the everlasting glory.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.020]   I wouldn't dare speak to you if I hadn't heard it.
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.020]   It's not cunningly devised fables. It's that."
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   But he says, "It's not only that.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.020]   We have also a word of prophecy
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.020]   made yet more sure
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.020]   unto which ye do well to pay heed
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.020]   as unto a light in a dark place
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:11.020]   until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts."
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.020]   For he says, "Let me remind you that no prophecy of Scripture
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.020]   is of any private interpretation.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.020]   It hasn't come as the result of the will or the energy
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.020]   or the understanding of men.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.020]   Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.020]   It wasn't their insight.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.020]   It was God revealing, giving them the message,
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.020]   telling them what to say, guiding them in the saying of it."
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   That's what he says.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.020]   So you see, this is the whole position.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.020]   This is why we say there is no other authority.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.020]   And the Apostle Paul says exactly the same thing
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.020]   in his second epistle to Timothy in the third chapter
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.020]   and in the sixteenth verse.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.020]   You remember it?
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.020]   "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God."
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.020]   Perhaps a better translation would be this.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.020]   "All Scripture is God-breathed
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.020]   and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.020]   for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.020]   that the men of God may be perfect,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.020]   truly punished, and to all good works."
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.020]   Now, my dear friends, this is why I say
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   that this is the only authority.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.020]   It's not men, it's God!
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.020]   The revelation of God.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.020]   What else?
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.020]   Well, I could keep you for a great length of time
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.020]   giving you the arguments for believing
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.020]   that this is the Word of God.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.020]   Read the Bible for yourself.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.020]   Look at the transcendent nature of its truth.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.020]   Look at the way in which it is expressed.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.020]   Look at the glories that belong to it,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.020]   that belong to no other literature.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.020]   But this is the thing that emerges so much
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.020]   in this thirty-fifth verse of the eighth chapter
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.020]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.020]   that I want to unfold to you.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.020]   The unity of the message.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   Have you ever considered this?
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.020]   Look at it.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.020]   "Then Philip opened his mouth
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:01.020]   and began at the same scripture."
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.020]   But he didn't finish there.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.020]   He only began there.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   He began with the scripture that this poor fellow
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.020]   was trying to understand and couldn't.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.020]   And then, beginning there,
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.020]   he explained it and expanded it
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.020]   and led on to others, and led on to others,
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.020]   and as he did so, he was preaching unto him,
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.020]   telling him the good news concerning Jesus.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.020]   But you see the point?
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   The unity of the message.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.020]   This is a book which some people have described
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.020]   as a library of books.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.020]   There are sixty-six different books in the Bible.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.020]   Sixty-six.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.020]   Written many of them by different men,
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   written in different ages,
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.020]   in different centuries,
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.020]   in different circumstances,
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.020]   and yet this is the astounding thing.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:52.020]   There is only one message in the whole book
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.020]   from beginning to end.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.020]   One message.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.020]   The same message always,
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.020]   put in different ways, different emphases,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.020]   but one continuous running message
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.020]   from beginning to end,
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.020]   with all this diversity in the writers and the conditions.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.020]   And so, you see, that is the explanation
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:19.020]   of what Philip was able to do.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.020]   You can start wherever you like in this book,
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.020]   and you'll always arrive at the same message.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:31.020]   You begin as they began on this occasion in Isaiah 53.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.020]   It doesn't matter where you begin.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.020]   You begin anywhere you like in this book,
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.020]   and you'll always arrive at the same end.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.020]   Why? Well, because it's all one.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.020]   It's got one great message.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:44.020]   There is this solidarity, this unity,
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   this essential oneness in the whole position.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.020]   And this is the thing that comes out, of course,
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.020]   in so many different ways.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.020]   They're reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.020]   Yet out of that, Philip, with extreme ease,
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.020]   is able to preach Jesus.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.020]   In other words, this is one of the greatest arguments of all,
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.020]   which proves that this is the word of God
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.020]   and the book of God.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.020]   The amazing phenomenon of prophecy.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   Isn't this astounding?
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.020]   Isaiah had written these words
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.020]   that the poor eunuch was trying to understand
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.020]   eight centuries before these two men
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.020]   met together on that road.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.020]   Eight hundred years!
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.020]   And yet Philip, with extreme ease,
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   was able to show him that what Isaiah had written about
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   was Jesus Christ, who just lived and died and risen again.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.020]   Eight hundred years!
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.020]   Ah, but this is the wonderful thing about prophecy.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.020]   And this is the thing that no human ingenuity
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.020]   can ever explain away.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.020]   How is it that men, eight centuries before the time,
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:55.020]   could not only prophesy the coming of the Son of God,
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:01.020]   but could give us these amazing exactness of detail,
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.020]   telling us all about him, down into the minutest details.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.020]   It's all here before us.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.020]   This is the great fact that proves
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.020]   that it is indeed the word of God.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.020]   So our only authority is the Scripture.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.020]   And preaching, teaching, making people Christian,
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.020]   consists of expounding it, bringing it out,
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:26.020]   showing them what it means.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.020]   Well then, what is the message?
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.020]   And it's all here, you see.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.020]   The message, the one message of the whole Bible,
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.020]   is simply this.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.020]   And oh, how Philip must have rejoiced
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.020]   when this man invited him into the chariot.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.020]   He knew exactly what he was going to tell him.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.020]   He knew this great message of the Bible.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.020]   What is it?
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.020]   Well, this is it.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.020]   The message of the Bible,
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.020]   oh, it's put in so many different ways.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.020]   And there are ramifications,
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.020]   and there is history, and this and that.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.020]   And if you don't see it, if you don't know the message,
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.020]   you'll get lost, as this poor fellow was getting lost.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.020]   But once you've seen this message,
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.020]   you see it running as a golden thread
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.020]   right through from the beginning to the very end.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.020]   What is it?
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.020]   It is the message
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:28.020]   that this world is God's world.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   That it wasn't meant to be like this.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.020]   That it's gone wrong, it's gone astray.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.020]   That it cannot put itself right.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.020]   But that God is still concerned.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.020]   God is still interested.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.020]   And God has got a plan and a purpose for its redemption.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.020]   That's the message of this book.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.020]   God, before the very world was made,
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.020]   has a plan for its redemption.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.020]   What is this book?
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.020]   This is the account given of that plan,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.020]   and how God has been revealing it in parts and portions,
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.020]   bringing it to pass in installments,
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.020]   and increasing, with increasing momentum.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.020]   And the purpose is redemption,
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.020]   deliverance, salvation,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.020]   the rescuing of people from the misery
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.020]   and the havoc and the despair
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.020]   into which they've got as the result of sin
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.020]   and listening to the devil,
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.020]   the enemy of God and the enemy of their soul.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:31.020]   The great plan, purpose of redemption of the world.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.020]   That is the one great message of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:41.020]   That is what Philip expounded to this poor Ethiopian human.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.020]   But notice the way in which it's put.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.020]   "Then Philip opened his mouth and began,"
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.020]   or "beginning at," that's a better translation,
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.020]   "beginning at the same scripture."
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.020]   He preached unto him the good news.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   He stated to him the good news concerning Jesus.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.020]   Good news.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.020]   Ah, the center of the message is Jesus.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.020]   This is where it all comes to a focus.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.020]   This is why I say you see this great unity.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.020]   This great book, 66 books.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.020]   But you know, this is the way to understand it.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.020]   There's a center to it.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.020]   Look at the other side of the center.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.020]   There's your Old Testament.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.020]   What's the Old Testament?
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.020]   Oh, the Old Testament is just a book
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:26.020]   that tells you that he's going to come.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.020]   I never tire of saying this.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.020]   I wish I'd kept a record of how many times
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.020]   I've said it in this pulpit.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.020]   I think I know exactly what Philip felt
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.020]   as he was stepping up into that chariot.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.020]   He knew what he was going to say.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.020]   And do you know what it is?
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.020]   He was going to say this.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.020]   "Yes, you're in trouble, of course you are.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.020]   "Everybody's in trouble.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.020]   "But listen to me, I've got something to tell you.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.020]   "God caused that man Isaiah to write that
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.020]   "which you've been reading and you can't understand.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.020]   "He wasn't the only man he caused to write.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.020]   "He started telling people what to say long before that.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:01.020]   "You know," said Philip to this man,
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:07.020]   "God began speaking to the human race.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.020]   "Even in the Garden of Eden,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.020]   "it was there that men rebelled and sinned
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:21.020]   "and listening to the devil brought chaos down upon himself.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.020]   "And it would have continued
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   "unless he had festered himself into hell.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.020]   "But God came down.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.020]   "And God spoke and God condemned men
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.020]   "for his rebellion and sin and folly.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.020]   "But he didn't stop at that.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.020]   "He gave him a promise.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.020]   "He told him that life was going to be
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.020]   "what you and I know it to be,
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.020]   "a strife and a conflict
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.020]   "between the seed of the serpent
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:49.020]   "and the seed of the woman.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.020]   "But he also said that the seed of the woman
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   "should bruise the serpent's head.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:00.020]   "That's the first promise of the coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.020]   "God said it there.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.020]   "Here's the preparation.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.020]   "He's going to send one.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   "He'll be the seed of the woman.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.020]   "Then you go on reading
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.020]   "and you'll come to a man called Abraham.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.020]   "And God said to that man,
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.020]   "he was 99 years of age and his wife was 90.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.020]   "He said, 'Look here, on you and Sarah,

[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:24.020]   "'all the nations of the earth are going to be blessed.'
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   "It seemed utter rubbish.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:31.020]   "And Sarah, in her unbelief, laughed.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   "But that was God promising
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.020]   "that eventually out of the seed of Abraham
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.020]   "this great and mighty deliverer should come.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.020]   "And he did.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:47.020]   "Jesus Christ was a Jew of the seed of Abraham.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.020]   "The promise was repeated to Isaac and to Jacob.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.020]   "It was repeated even to Judah.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.020]   "He was told that the great Shiloh
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.020]   "was going to come out of his loins,
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.020]   "though he was an adulterer amongst other things.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.020]   "It doesn't matter, you see.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   "It's God's plan, the deliverer, the promise.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   "And all the Old Testament is looking forward to him.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.020]   "Did you know that the very furniture
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.020]   "and the decorations of the tabernacle
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.020]   "are prophecies of Christ?

[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.020]   "Then you come to the writings of these great prophets,

[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.020]   "What are they doing?

[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:06.020]   This is the message of the entire Old Testament.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.020]   Waiting for the coming,
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.020]   giving details about the arrival
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   of this blessed deliverer.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.020]   Then you come to your New Testament.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.020]   What's that?
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.020]   "Well, here he is.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.020]   "He's come.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.020]   "He preached unto him Jesus."
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.020]   What did he say?
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:24.020]   "Well, he told him the facts about Jesus.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:30.020]   "He told him first how he was born.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:36.020]   "He told him about an archangel visiting Mary, his mother.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.020]   "He told him about all that preparation
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.020]   "and how it was a virgin birth.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.020]   "This extraordinary child, this mystery, this marvel.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.020]   "It's a part of the story.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.020]   "He preached unto him Jesus.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.020]   "Jesus, yes, but Jesus was only a man, you say,
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.020]   "and only a carpenter.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.020]   "No, no.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.020]   "This is the whole point.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   "Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   "And how do you know that he is the Son of God?
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   "Well, it's his birth to start with.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.020]   "And then his extraordinary life.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.020]   "His teaching.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.020]   "Never men spake like this man.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.020]   "His miracles.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.020]   "The blind receive their sight.
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   "The lame walk.

[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.020]   "The dead are raised.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:31.020]   "Jesus, miracles, power, manifestation, storm calm.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.020]   "Raging waves and billows silenced.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:41.020]   "All known in peace.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:47.020]   "And then his extraordinary death in apparent utter weakness.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   "His burial.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.020]   "The grave.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.020]   "The storm.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:57.020]   "And yet the storm removed.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.020]   "The empty grave.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.020]   "The resurrection.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.020]   "The appearances.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.020]   "The ascension.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.020]   "That's what he preached.
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.020]   "You see, you've got to take all this.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.020]   "The scriptures prophesying.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.020]   "The fact fulfilled.
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.020]   "The verification.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.020]   "The events.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.020]   "The history.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.020]   "Not cunningly devised fables, but facts.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   "Apostolic witness and testimony.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:22.020]   "Witnesses to the resurrection.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:29.020]   "And then his own prophecy that he would send upon them the Holy Ghost.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:34.020]   "After he had returned to heaven.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.020]   "And then the tremendous thing that happened at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.020]   "When the Holy Ghost suddenly came upon them.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   "And they were transfigured and transformed.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   "Spake with other tongues.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   "Had the power and amazing ability themselves to work miracles.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.020]   "This is the message.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.020]   "The Gospels unfold him.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.020]   "The Old Testament looked forward to him.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.020]   "The Gospels tell us he's come.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.020]   "The book of Acts looks back to him.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.020]   And the epistles expound him.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:18.020]   And show the meaning of his life, his death, his teaching, and everything else.
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   And then the book of Revelation.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.020]   The last book in the Bible.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.020]   What is this?
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.020]   Well here is a book that tells you about him still.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.020]   He's the center of every book in the Bible.
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.020]   And it tells you that he's going to come again.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:38.020]   That he's going to destroy his every enemy.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.020]   He's going to have victory.
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.020]   He's going to reign from pole to pole and shore to shore.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.020]   And that the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:51.020]   Of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:58.020]   And that every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:02.020]   To the glory of God the Father.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   He opened his mouth and beginning at the same scripture he preached unto him,
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.020]   "Jesus!"
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.020]   He told him the good news of Jesus.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.020]   What's the point of all of this?
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   Who is he? What is he? What's he come to do?
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:24.020]   And the answer is that it is good news.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:29.020]   It was given to poor old Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist,
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.020]   to state it first.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   He said it himself, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.020]   He preached unto him, "Jesus!"
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.020]   He said, "You're lost. You are helpless. You are wretched. Do you know?
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   He's come to save you."
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.020]   The one Isaiah was writing about is Jesus.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.020]   And he's come to save you.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.020]   To give you light, understanding, knowledge, life, forgiveness.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.020]   All you stand in need of.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:05.020]   The good news of Jesus.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:17.020]   That, my friends, is the content of the message of the scriptures.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.020]   That's the Christian message.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:24.020]   That you, whoever you are, whatever you may have been,
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:29.020]   whatever you may have done, doesn't matter.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:36.020]   You are a sinner. You are helpless. You are lost. You are hopeless.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   You're as helpless as this poor Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:43.020]   You can change from paganism to Judaism.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:50.020]   You can change from a vague pantheism to the highest that the Greek philosophers have got to give you.
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:56.020]   And you'll be as blind at the end as you were at the beginning.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.020]   But there is one who can give you light.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.020]   He can give you life.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.020]   He can assure you of forgiveness of your sins.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:13.020]   He can introduce you to God and make you a child of God.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:23.020]   He can change you from a miserable, unhappy seeker into a confident and a rejoicing disciple.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.020]   For the last we read about this eunuch is this.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:33.020]   He went on his way rejoicing.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.020]   Are you rejoicing?
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:41.020]   You're in the same world as this man was in.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:46.020]   With the same problems and the same failure and the same helplessness.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.020]   But in spite of that, he goes on his way rejoicing.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.020]   Are you rejoicing?
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.020]   There's only one way to rejoice in this world.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:03.020]   It is to believe the good news concerning this Jesus.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.020]   It is to acknowledge and confess your sins.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   It is to do what Peter told the people to do in the day of Pentecost.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:13.020]   They cried out saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.020]   And this is the answer.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:19.020]   Repent, acknowledge and confess your sins, your failure and helplessness.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:26.020]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for remission of sins.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:32.020]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:42.020]   And thou shalt be saved and kept safe in time and in eternity.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.020]   Amen.
