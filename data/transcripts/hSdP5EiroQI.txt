[00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.960]   And actually, this is a very universal concept.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.640]   Programmers are in the business of aligning
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.560]   silicon via code specifications.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   Product managers align teams via product specifications.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.320]   Lawmakers literally align humans via legal specifications.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.220]   And everyone in this room, whenever you are doing a prompt,
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.360]   it's a sort of proto-specification.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.540]   You are in the business of aligning
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.880]   AI models towards a common set of intentions and values.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.380]   And whether you realize it or not,
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.940]   you are spec authors in this world.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.400]   And specs let you ship faster and safer.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.900]   Everyone can contribute.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.640]   And whoever writes the spec, be it a PM, a lawmaker, an engineer,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.320]   a marketer, is now the programmer.
