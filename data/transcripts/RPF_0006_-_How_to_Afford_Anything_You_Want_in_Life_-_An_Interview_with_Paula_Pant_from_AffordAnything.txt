[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets, and today I'm
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.480]   excited to have Paula from Afford Anything on the line. Paula, welcome.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.120]   Hi. Thanks for having me on. I'm really glad to have you on. I'm
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.000]   really glad to have you on. I first heard about you over on the Mad Scientist Podcast,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.640]   and then I went over to your site. I heard you featured there on that interview. Then
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.800]   I went over to your site, and I was so intrigued by the name of your site, which is AffordAnything.com.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   It's always an attention grabber. People tend to remember it.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.920]   It really is. I think it's one of the better names. Obviously, there are tens of thousands
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.680]   of financial blogs and things out there that people can find, but I love the name of that
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.320]   site. How did you come up with that? What was the philosophy behind it?
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:06.760]   The philosophy behind the site speaks really well to the name. When I was about 24, I quit
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.000]   my job and went off traveling for a while. Everybody kept saying to me at that time,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.600]   "Oh, I would love to do something like that, but I can't afford it." Those are the key
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   words that they kept repeating, "I can't afford it. I can't afford it. I can't afford
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.680]   it." I wanted to smack my head against a wall every time I heard that, because I'm
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.640]   like, "Dude, you can. You can afford anything." That was where the name of the site came from.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.240]   I share that same frustration. I know from reading your blog that I think you went and
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.280]   traveled for how long? Two years at least?
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.480]   Two years, a little over two years, yeah, nonstop, and without working during that time.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.000]   Good for you. We're going to get to some of the strategies. I've never traveled for
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   two years straight, but I have been blessed to visit ... I don't know. Let's see. I think
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.320]   I figured it out one time. I had the opportunity to visit about 25 countries by the time I
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   was about 25 years old.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.160]   Oh, that's excellent. That's really cool.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.960]   My friends would always say, "Well, how on earth do you do that?" I would just say,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.040]   "Do you see the car I'm driving?"
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   Most people spend their money on their cars. I always just figured, "Well, I don't mind
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.760]   so much a cheap car. I'd rather have more stamps than my passport."
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.600]   Right, exactly. That's the part that people don't get. They'll be talking to me with
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:44.120]   full manicure and pedicure and highlighted hair and a Venti Starbucks, no whip, grande,
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.080]   whatever, whatever in their hand. They're like, "Oh, I could never afford to do that.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.880]   You must be rich." I'm like, "Really? Do you see yourself right now?"
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.080]   It's a matter of priorities.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   Exactly.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.760]   I think there's a lot of alignment between what you write about and the focus of my show.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.320]   My main thing is not to tell people what they should or shouldn't do, but to help people,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.040]   to encourage people to understand what they actually want versus just simply accepting
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.440]   them what society and life throws at them and then figure out some smart ways to get
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.880]   what they want. I think you've encapsulated it perfectly in two words, far more succinctly
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   than I could.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.000]   I love that philosophy because I feel like there's a lot of personal financial advice
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.920]   out there that dictates the path. It's meant to be one size fits all. When you go online
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.640]   and you read financial articles or when you read books, it's meant for the average consumer.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.480]   They write about buying cars and buying houses and buying this and buying that and replacing
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.640]   80% of your pre-retirement income in retirement. They make all of these unstated assumptions
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.760]   about what you want and what kind of lifestyle you want and how much money you're spending,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.000]   how much of your income you're spending.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.720]   None of those assumptions need to be true. You don't need to follow this prescription
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.640]   that's out there for the masses. If you want to, if you've thought about it and that's
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.760]   the life that you genuinely want to lead, then that's great. I'm just sick of the one
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.960]   size fits all financial advice out there. I think it's just insane.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.640]   I agree with you. Do you get frustrated like I do when people say, "Oh, you can't buy
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.760]   this car. You can't do that." I get frustrated because it's your money. Spend it on whatever
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.080]   you want to. Just make sure that you've decided it and that it's really something that is
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   fulfilling to you.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.440]   Exactly. There's a huge difference between somebody like me who, "I don't really know
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.480]   anything about cars. I don't really care that much about cars. They just don't interest
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.920]   me." There's a big difference between a person like me and a person who reads car magazines,
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.960]   hangs out on car blogs, hangs a poster of a car in his childhood bedroom. There's a
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.760]   big difference between the two of us.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.960]   If you were to give the two of us the same kind of financial advice when it comes to
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.280]   buying a car, it just wouldn't apply. It would be like telling a person, and that goes with
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.120]   everything. It would be like telling people how much money that they should spend on travel
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:46.080]   or on watching sports games or anything else. Your passions are your passions. No one can
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   tell you how much of your budget you should allocate towards that.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.200]   I'm 100% with you. You write a personal finance blog. Have you always been a money person?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.400]   Tell us a little bit about your path, so to speak. Were you always super frugal and saving
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.200]   and investing from six years old, or was it something that developed as an adult? Tell
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   us a little bit about your path.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.280]   I was always very frugal. I'm a child of immigrants. Technically, I myself am also an immigrant,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.800]   but I came to the United States when I was a baby. My parents came here with me in tow
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   when I was still wearing diapers. We started with nothing. Family started with nothing
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.160]   and built everything from scratch. They didn't have any money. They didn't have any connections.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.200]   They didn't have any family that they could lean on.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.720]   Throughout my childhood, we were middle class, but we were very, very frugal. My parents
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:52.600]   worked very hard to just get us established in the United States. I learned from seeing
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.440]   that example. Throughout my life, I'd always been very frugal as well.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:05.760]   One thing that I'm just coming to grips with now as an adult is learning the difference
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:16.440]   between being frugal within your personal life versus investing in growing your business.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.880]   If you try to be too – and I don't want to go off on a tangent about this necessarily,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.680]   but there's a time to be frugal and there's a time to not be. That's one of the really
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.880]   hard things for me to learn as an adult is reinvesting in your business and taking the
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:37.760]   money that you've made instead of just hoarding it, spending it in the hopes of earning more.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.960]   I guess that's a different topic for a different day.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.280]   Actually, I'm interested in that because it's something that a lot of times isn't
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.960]   discussed. Just to let you know a little bit about me since we haven't spoken before
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.720]   this, I'm interested in the things that nobody talks about. One of those things that
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:06.840]   people don't talk about is simply the difference between luxury consumption and investment.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.640]   I just recorded a show about how to cut your cell phone bill by tons of money. I think
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   it's a really valuable resource for those who would benefit from that information.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.600]   But exactly parallel with it, if you make millions of dollars on your phone, you better
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.720]   have the absolute best phone that you can get with the best service that you can get
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.240]   and you probably should have a couple of backups. It's a very challenging transition for people
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.460]   to make and it's challenging to have a decision tree because you may have a decision tree
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.920]   for your own if you're very focused on this is what I'm doing and I'm saving money
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.120]   for this goal. Well, no, I'm not going to spend on that. But when you get into the
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.080]   world of retirement and investing and financially independent, it's much more challenging.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   Absolutely. You phrased it really well. I love the way you said luxury consumption versus
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:10.240]   investment. Your phone example is a great one because we've dealt with that. My boyfriend
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:18.440]   as an example, he runs a small business and oftentimes he is out in the middle of nowhere
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:26.280]   like rural Oklahoma, just out very, very far away from civilization in places where there
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:34.400]   is not very good cell phone reception. He's in a position where missing a call could literally
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.440]   cost him tens of thousands of dollars. So are we going to cheap out and try and get
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:49.000]   a $10 a month cell phone plan? No, of course not. And so I guess that's the difference.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.920]   It's very easy to write a book or to write a blog post or to make a speech that gives
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:03.080]   this one size fits all financial advice that says cut your expenses as much as possible
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:13.360]   and do it yourself. Mow your own lawn and paint your own house and insource as much
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   as possible. But that's fine if you're speaking about it within the context of luxury consumption,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.520]   financial consumption, but there's a massive difference when you're talking about it within
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.800]   the context of growing and investing. And I think that a lot of times people fail to
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.320]   really make that distinction. Particularly if like me, you tend to be naturally frugal
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:56.120]   anyway. It's hard, but it's absolutely pivotal to come to grips with the fact that you're
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.560]   going to have to start paying people to mow your lawn because you know what? That's one
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.520]   less thing, not just one less thing that you have to do, but one less thing that you have
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:12.560]   to track. And by freeing up both that time and that mental space, you can spend that
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:21.520]   additional hour per week on a sales call with a client that could net you an extra $700
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.760]   a month. You know?
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:32.040]   Do you think that most people make financial decisions rationally or do they tend to go
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.360]   towards whatever they're accustomed to?
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:43.400]   I think habit is very, very powerful. I actually wrote a post not too long ago about, it was
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.320]   based on a book called The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. I'm sure I'm mispronouncing
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:55.920]   his name. One of the best books that I've read this year, and it talked about how powerful
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:03.880]   habit is and how most people, even if they're not conscious of it, tend to get looped into
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.720]   habits when they make decisions because the brain wants to do whatever is easiest and
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:17.440]   so it follows the path that it knows.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.040]   The reason I ask that question is because the thing that you're touching on, I think,
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.000]   strikes to the heart of how challenging it is in the financial world, especially the
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.160]   online financial world, is that we all have things that, I'll pick on the mow the lawn
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.640]   example because it's a good one. It's a great one. I can think of at least four or five
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   different ways to approach that decision. In fact, I'm going to be releasing either
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.400]   right before this show goes out or right after my ultimate guide to a smart person's way
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:00.120]   of making decisions. That's a pretty pretentious term. In that lawn example, I can think of
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.160]   at least several ways that that example could be made.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.840]   Example one would be, let's say, I'm going to make these scenarios up on the fly here,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.720]   and they're going to be extreme, but I think they'll demonstrate how each one of us needs
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   to consider and make these decisions. Number one, somebody is not earning a high income,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.800]   has a steady salary job where they're not going to be paid significantly more for working
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:32.560]   more and has a goal of saving money. That's a really great situation where somebody can
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.840]   focus on mowing your own lawn.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.880]   On the other hand, somebody has a very high income, very stressful job, and they absolutely
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.880]   despise mowing their lawn. It's one of their least favorite things in the world. That would
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:52.160]   be a good candidate to just simply hire out the lawn. That could be a very simple decision,
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.240]   but the next decision would be, "Why do I have a lawn at all? Could I just simply eliminate
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.560]   the lawn and eliminate the expense and eliminate the time, or could I turn that lawn into something
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.000]   that's productive for me?" Instead of unproductive grass, could I do some sort of productive
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.080]   plants or could I do some sort of xeriscaping strategy where I just eliminate, "I still
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.080]   have the yard, but I don't have the lawn." There are five examples of different ways
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.720]   that you can turn it. One, you could spend money, and it could be completely right for
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.080]   one person to spend money on paying someone to do it because they earn income and they
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.120]   want to turn that extra time and income. The other person, it could be completely wrong,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.480]   or both of them could make a completely different choice. That can't be simplified into one
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.240]   blog post saying, "I mow my lawn, so you should too."
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.800]   Right, right. It's funny because when you bring up the, "Why have a lawn at all?" because
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   that touches on so many other factors. Do you have a lawn because you live in an area
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:53.120]   where single-family homes look like, based on your market research, single-family homes
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   look like they're going to appreciate much better than condos will? Therefore, even though
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.320]   a lawn is an expense, the overall decision to have a home with a lawn could end up netting
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.200]   you more in the long run than the decision to have a condo without any underlying land.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   That would be an example where paying somebody to mow your lawn would be an overhead cost
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.920]   to a long-term investing strategy that you're trying to make.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   Another example would be, I own several rental properties. One of them is a multi-unit. With
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.280]   a single-family home, generally the tenant mows their own lawn, but in a multi-unit,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   it's the landlord's responsibility. There's another example. Even then, when you say,
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:51.240]   "Why do you have a lawn?" there are hundreds of different reasons that a person might give
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   for that. Some of them could actually be the wiser financial choice, depending on your
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.640]   individual situation.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   It all goes back to one individual's goals. To me, that's where everything has to start.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:18.040]   You have a good point with type of property. It seems, obviously, travel is something that's
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:24.520]   important to you. It may be that in one area of the country, a single-family home is a
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.880]   much better rental market to be in, but there may also be a lot more hassle with maintaining
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.200]   that. That might not fit one person's travel goals, or the person may have the resources
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.840]   and the ability to make it fit their travel goals.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.480]   Having five condos might be easier for a landlord who wants to be an absentee landlord to manage
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:50.480]   than having four plexes. Everything comes down to individual choices and individual
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:58.880]   goals. Based on those goals, that's how we all decide what's right for us.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   Exactly. I don't quite know how we arrived here, but I think we led to this from financial
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:15.920]   advice that is true, one size fits all. Not my taste. Not my thing.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:22.480]   I'm with you. I'm interested in ... You don't have to disclose anything you don't want to,
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.200]   but as a young person, you're under 30, right?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.840]   Just barely under 30. I've got a couple more months left.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.400]   Okay. Congratulations. Are you on track to hit your goal of 30 countries by the age of
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:35.680]   30?
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   I am. I need to go to one more country. I've been to 29 countries, and I'm 29 years old,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:49.840]   so I need to go to one more before my 30th birthday, which is ... Let's see. It's July
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:56.960]   right now still. I guess maybe it's almost August. I'll be turning 30 in October.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.320]   Good for you.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.360]   I've got a couple of months.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.920]   What's the next country you're going to?
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.520]   I have no idea.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.880]   Well, maybe after we finish recording, I'll try to give you some ideas of some places
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   that I love. There are a lot of great choices. How would you characterize as far as your
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.640]   main financial goals? Are you pursuing this idea of financial independence? I go where
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.160]   I want to. I do what I want to. Are you pursuing I want to travel the world? Are you pursuing
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.800]   I want to do work I love? How do you characterize your major financial goals? My goal is that
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.160]   this show would speak to people in their 20s and 30s about some of the things that are
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.000]   available at a young age. I'd be interested in what you're working towards.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   One of the things I'm most proud of is that I have not had a 9-to-5 job since 2008. I
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.560]   was 24 the last time that I had a traditional 9-to-5 job. That's a huge step.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   That's a huge point of pride for me because I have always aspired to not be in a cubicle.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:13.280]   So far, so good. I've never been in one.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:24.080]   When I graduated from college, and this was in 2001, I had the same idea that most of
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.720]   my friends had, which is that I was supposed to get a job. In hindsight, that was kind
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   of a ridiculous assumption. Because once I started working, I realized that for me, it
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:43.320]   was so possible to work for yourself and work from home or work from your laptop anywhere
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:52.240]   in the world, be completely location independent. It took me three years before I managed to
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.160]   bite the bullet and quit my job. I understood it in theory, but I was scared to actually
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.440]   pull the trigger. But by the time I quit my job, I had some substantial savings. I went
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.960]   and traveled for two years without working, and then came back and started working for
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.720]   myself. I've been doing it ever since.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   When you ask about my goals, I feel like I'm very much already there in the sense that
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.720]   I'm working for myself from anywhere in the world that I want. I'm completely location
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   independent. I own a handful of rental properties. My boyfriend and I together own six rental
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:43.880]   units. I feel like we're basically just living the life. I guess maybe more of the same,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.880]   just keep doing what I'm doing, but more so. I guess that's the only goal, really.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:21:03.280]   Got it. The reason I ask is, and I know maybe it's not something you've been asked, it's
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   very challenging, I think, when most young people's goals are, I guess, more easily reduced
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.520]   to a checklist. They get boiled down. I want to do this. I want to go here. I want to own
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.400]   this. I want to be in this type of relationship with this type of focus.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.040]   When it comes to financial goals, many financial goals get pushed off to a later date. I'd
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   like to retire someday. It seems like it takes a lot of courage to move that date up, because
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:44.440]   then what you find is that instead of maybe finding fulfillment in the day-to-day work
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:51.640]   or the day-to-day job, you've got to find fulfillment in other things.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:59.040]   I'm interested in young people who are making that transition and some of their experiences
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.120]   as far as how they make that transition and how you fill your time if it's not about,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.880]   "I'm going to build this specific career," if you've already achieved some level of financial
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:15.880]   freedom. It takes the bull off the back of some people. I don't have a specific question
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:24.440]   there. I'm always interested in gathering people's experiences and learning from others
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.760]   who have been down the road before.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.400]   You've chosen real estate as the primary vehicle for your income?
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   No. Real estate is one of my favorite ways to invest. It's not my primary source of income.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:47.360]   My primary source of income is I do freelance writing and online marketing and work from
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:55.880]   my laptop for a handful of clients. It's pretty great. My ambition was always to run my own
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.440]   business and work for myself. I think one of the reasons that retirement doesn't particularly
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.760]   appeal to me, financial freedom appeals to me in the sense that who doesn't want to have
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   the security of knowing that you've got enough money coming in that you'll be okay.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   I don't ever want to retire because I actually really enjoy working. I really enjoy what
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:29.880]   I do. I enjoy problem solving and helping people. I built my business from scratch.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   I literally built it from nothing. I'm very proud of it and I want to keep it going.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:49.240]   In terms of financial freedom, that's what the rental properties are for. I've got enough
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   passive income coming in that I could, in theory, if there was a big family health crisis
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:04.120]   or something like that, if some emergency came up, I could entirely stop working and
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:11.200]   trim back my stop going to restaurants and I'd be all right. I'd be fine. I wouldn't
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:19.440]   be eating at restaurants and I wouldn't be wearing fancy Abercrombie clothes or anything
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   like that, but I would totally be fine and that's a really good feeling to have.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   I've often thought that pursuing financial independence at an early age is a worthy goal
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:40.040]   because if you are able to achieve it or at least see yourself closer to it, you're able
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.360]   to actually look at your source of income and see if this is something that you're doing
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   because you enjoy it or if it's something that you're doing because you have to do it.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.600]   Then when you continue to work at it, mainly because you enjoy it, you feel a lot better
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.800]   about it than being there because you have to.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   Yeah, I definitely agree with that. In fact, I'd say that it increases job satisfaction.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.920]   The sense of liberation increases job satisfaction because every day that you go to work, you
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.440]   know that it's a choice that you're making and that you don't have to do this. If you
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   just sort of trim back your lifestyle a little bit, yeah, you don't have to do this at all,
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:31.760]   but you like it. You like the game. You stay in it because it's interesting.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.400]   I noticed that many of the wealthiest people in the world don't sit around and watch TV
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   all afternoon. They tend to still continue working at their businesses and creating things.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   Right, exactly. Bill Gates, Donald Trump, I mean these guys don't have to work, but
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.440]   presumably they do it because they love it.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.160]   Absolutely. What attracted you to real estate versus other forms of investing as a strategy
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.560]   for early financial independence?
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   Good question. I was more interested in monthly cash flow than I was in potential future appreciation.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:17.720]   By that I mean, well, I'll use real estate as the example because a lot of people when
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.120]   you tell them that you're in real estate, their first thought jumps to the value of
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   the house going up over time. When I buy houses, the potential appreciation of the house is
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   secondary. I mean very, very secondary. To me, I'm looking for how much cash that house
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:47.080]   can produce each month just because that's my philosophy. That's what I'm interested
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:54.000]   in is monthly cash flows, replacing that monthly income.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.560]   To me, real estate rental properties specifically were a better way to do that than stocks.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:07.040]   There are people who are really into dividend investing and collecting that monthly dividend.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.960]   Looking at that, I mean I and maybe I'm sure there are people who are much better than
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.800]   I am who could get better returns, but when I looked into dividend investing, what I saw
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   was 3% to 4% returns with lots of volatility in the underlying asset versus the cash flow
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   asset versus when I looked at houses, I saw 8% to 12% returns with much less volatility.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:38.920]   For me, it was a no-brainer at that point. Of course, the trade-off is that my investment
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.640]   is highly illiquid. My cash is tied up in the houses, so I can't just snap my fingers
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.320]   and sell at a moment's notice. If I'm getting really good monthly cash flow, I don't really
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.960]   want to, so I'm fine with that trade-off.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   What role did leverage play in early real estate investing?
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:09.000]   Leverage was important for getting into, certainly for the first property. My first property
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.800]   was a triplex, which we bought in 2010. That one was a $1,000 property. That was a $1,000
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.800]   property. That one we put some money down and then leveraged into the rest. The second
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   one, however, we bought entirely in cash. That one only cost $21,000. The second property
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:39.360]   we bought entirely in cash. The third property, we got an investor loan. We got a loan from
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.000]   a private party.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.120]   I guess to answer your question, we've used leverage in some deals and haven't used leverage
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   in others. It's certainly very helpful in getting in. I love Dave Ramsey, but I do not
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:07.480]   share his philosophy of never, ever, ever, ever, ever touch debt. I tend to be a bit
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   more on the Robert Kiyosaki side of believing that leverage is okay in situations where
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   it's cash flow positive with a very healthy margin.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   That said, I am not like most real estate investors in that -- I shouldn't say most,
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:34.840]   but there are some real estate investors who get a little out of hand with leverage. I
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   would caution you against that. I think it's something to be used very judiciously in limited
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   circumstances and only if you've got huge, huge margins of error.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:30:04.520]   The reason I ask is because it has often seemed to me real estate can be very attractive for
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:11.520]   younger people because of the ability to leverage it and buy cash flow. You really can buy cash
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   flow in real estate investing. If you have the right property and the right deal, how
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.440]   many properties would you say you look at for every deal that you've purchased of the
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.200]   six that you own now?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   Oh my goodness. It's like a full-time job. It really is. It's an incredible, incredible
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.680]   time suck looking at properties.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:41.320]   Yeah. If somebody does have the time to look at the properties and work through the deals,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.560]   many real estate investors I've spoken with have often said they'll look at 100 houses
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   for every property they wind up buying. If you find the right deal where the money works,
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.360]   the nice thing about leverage on real estate is generally it's non-recourse, unlike maybe
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:05.200]   a margin account to buy dividend paying stocks where you borrow money to buy the stocks.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.480]   Stock value declines, your loan is callable and you got to come up with the cash whereas
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.960]   real estate with a traditional loan generally the bank can't call the loan. As long as you
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.680]   can come up with the cash regardless of what happens with the values, if you buy a good
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:24.800]   cash flow with a good margin of safety, it can really work well.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:30.280]   Are there any specific numbers or ratios that you look at when you're evaluating properties?
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   My quick and dirty back of the envelope calculation is called the 1% rule. That is that the monthly
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:45.060]   rental income, gross rental income, must be at least 1% of the purchase price. If you're
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:52.240]   buying a $100,000 house, the monthly rental income should be at least $1,000. That's just
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   a quick and dirty back of the envelope calculation. It's the first step, not the last. If a property
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:09.720]   does not meet the 1% rule, it's out. It's gone from the game. I don't consider it.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:16.920]   Running those numbers, that's at least a starting point for you to feel comfortable with working
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:22.360]   out the further numbers of vacancy rates and financing costs and all that and just backing
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.640]   into it. I'll explain why I feel that that rule is
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:32.640]   so important. If your monthly gross rental is 1% of the purchase price, then annually,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:41.320]   your annual revenue is 12% of the purchase price. That's $12,000 on a $100,000 house.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:48.480]   Let's say that 50% of that goes into expenses, such as non-mortgage expenses, such as management,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   maintenance, repairs, vacancies, all of that. 50% of that goes into expenses. You're left
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:06.120]   with a 6% return on that $100,000 house. That's pretty good.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.240]   That's just the cash flow. If you assume that the house appreciates at the rate of inflation,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   and inflation is 2.5% to 3%, then that means that over the long term, you're getting about
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   an 8.5% to 9% return on that house. That's a pretty good return on investment, or at
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:35.160]   least it's not bad. It's not terrible. 8.5% to 9% is certainly a rate of return that I'd
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:44.000]   be happy with. That is why I'm such a firm believer in the 1% rule.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.920]   It makes sense. It gives you a convenient ... Those round numbers and those simple rules
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   like that really help to make quick judgments. I think it's valuable for people who haven't
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   invested in real estate to think about numbers like that, just so that when deals fall across
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.480]   your lap ... Because if I remember, your first deal just fell into your lap.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:13.040]   It did. We were literally renting the house across the street, and we saw the for sale
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   sign in the yard. We just did a very, very rough and dirty calculation in our head, and
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.840]   realized that this would just be a golden opportunity. We just jumped on it. It was
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.560]   sort of an impulse buy. Are you not somebody that's affected by fear?
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:38.320]   Yeah. I was definitely scared before we did it, but my solution to fear is to just recheck
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   the spreadsheet and run the spreadsheet 100 different times using a bunch of different
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:54.360]   scenarios, like best case, worst case, every iteration of medium case. If the spreadsheet
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:04.360]   works out, if the math works out, I think that's the best antidote to fear.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.560]   Also, understanding the worst case scenarios, right?
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.600]   Yeah. Understanding the worst case scenario from a mathematical point of view. You hear
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.600]   a lot of naysayers who love to give anecdotal information about, "Oh, rental properties
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:27.280]   are terrible. Your tenants are going to drive a motorcycle through your house, and start
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   a meth lab, and raise a pig farm in the middle of your attic," or whatever they say.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:42.280]   You can't let those anecdotes scare you. I find it best to just sort of ignore the
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:52.760]   naysayers. If you're getting advice from people who aren't in the industry, then you're not
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:59.440]   listening to the right people. Go to the people who actually do it day in and day out, and
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:06.040]   listen to what they have to say. Don't listen to Cousin Eddie.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.960]   Good old broke Cousin Eddie. I'm going to pick on some of my favorite articles, because
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:18.520]   I'm interested in just hearing you talk about a couple of concepts that I read on your site.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   Pretend that you're speaking to either a young person or a young couple in their 20s or 30s
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:34.480]   that has a significant amount of debt, regardless of why it's there and what it is. You wrote
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.080]   an article called, "Forget Your Debt. Just Forget About It, Really." It doesn't sound
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   like very good financial advice. Walk us through what your thoughts are and your philosophies.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.560]   I really enjoyed the way that you thought about that.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.560]   When I first started writing about personal finance, one of the things that shocked me
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:01.240]   was reading people who were in debt. Many of them had this ... They were so consumed
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   by the idea that they were in debt. All they could think about was getting out of debt,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:16.080]   getting their personal balance sheet up to zero. They almost spoke as though once they
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:23.240]   were debt-free, they would be free. I've never had consumer debt. I've never had a debt-free
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.040]   debt. I've never had a credit card balance. I've never had a car loan. I've never had
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   any of that. But I never felt free because I always have to buy groceries and keep the
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:46.880]   electricity on. Those are still very real bills that need to be paid. It baffled me
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:55.560]   for a moment how people would talk about being debt-free as the goal when really that's just
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:02.720]   one piece of the puzzle. I wrote this blog post called "Forget Your Debt" in which I
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   said, "Listen, it's not about whether you have debt or whether you don't. It's about
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:16.800]   at all points in your life making the most financially sound choice. If you have a dollar,
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:23.600]   what's the most financially savvy way that you can spend that dollar?" Now, if you've
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   got a credit card with an 18% interest rate and you have a potential investment that's
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:39.000]   going to pay you 8%, which one of those two options would you choose? You would choose
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.440]   the guaranteed payoff of something that's costing you 18% versus an investment that
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:52.560]   may give you 8%, not because you want to get out of debt but just because the numbers make
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   sense. It's a subtle difference, subtle mental shift. But you stop identifying as a person
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:09.360]   who has debt and just start identifying as a person who makes financially savvy choices.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:14.880]   So what if my choice is, how would you talk me through if I said, "Oh, you know what,
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.320]   Paula? That makes all the sense in the world. I'm going to think from abundance and financial
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:26.760]   independence, and tickets to Europe right now are only a thousand bucks. How would you talk
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   me through it? I have a lot of consumer debt. How would you talk me through that then?"
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.760]   Paula Bruggerman Well, so, all right. Yeah. Okay. A ticket
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.040]   to Europe.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.400]   David Altman I know it's hypothetical, but it's an interesting
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.200]   – I hear it a lot.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.960]   Paula Bruggerman So a ticket to Europe right now is $1,000,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.840]   and you've got a credit card with a, what, let's say an 18% or a 20% interest rate on
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:57.840]   it. And that interest compounds upon itself. So if you took that trip to Europe and didn't
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.120]   put that thousand towards paying off your credit card, how much longer would it take
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   you to pay off that credit card? Crunch the numbers on that. What additional amount of
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.200]   interest would you pay? Let's say – I'm just pulling numbers out of thin air. Let's
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   say that you would end up paying an additional $800 in interest over the added amount of
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.600]   time that it would take you to pay off that credit card. Okay. Well, so, how much is the
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   current discount for tickets to Europe? Is it normally a $1,500 ticket, and now it's
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   $1,000? Because if that's the case, you still end up $300 in the hole. You're better
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:47.120]   off paying the higher-priced ticket to Europe later in this particular scenario using these
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.520]   hypothetical numbers.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.920]   Jay C. Harness Yeah. You're exactly right. And the interesting
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.200]   thing – ultimately it always comes back to what someone wants, right? So it does come
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.560]   back to kind of what someone's goals are. And the thing I did like about – I loved
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.480]   about your article is that at the end of the day, the only way to get out of debt is just
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   to pay payments on the debt. That's really it. And you could talk about what order to
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.560]   do it in, and that's where most people get bogged down. But to me, what I find more powerful
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   than the order is the reason, which is what you touch on with freedom. Thinking like a
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   financial – coming from a term of place of financial abundance, and most goals are
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:42.080]   – most financial goals are more challenging to achieve if you have a heavy ongoing monthly
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:48.160]   expenses or if you have an extra heavy cost of a ticket added on by just simply the financing
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   cost. But it doesn't have to be this terrible thing where, "Woe is me, I'm in debt,"
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.120]   because I've seen lots of people get totally focused on paying off their debt, and they
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.840]   achieve this magical milestone of zero debt, and six months later, they're right back
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:11.120]   in it. It's not for something. If it's not for a reason, at least my observation
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:17.880]   is it tends not to last. But if that reason is clear, you can enjoy the process all the
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.080]   way out even though you may be working very hard at it.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:28.880]   But it's challenging because I think people have to find little tricks that work for them.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:35.880]   They have to find the little reasons why, whether it's the trip to Europe or whatever
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:44.680]   their specific focus is. But it's the favorite topic of the financial world.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   >> Yes, debt is certainly a very popular topic.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   >> My other article, favorite article from you, "Stop crying that there are no jobs.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.960]   Create one."
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.360]   >> That one, I was surprised to see how popular that one became. There are two on that site
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.160]   that surprised me with their popularity. One was that one, and then the other was "Quit
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   your job and travel." "Quit your job, travel, and live remarkably," I think was the full
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.760]   title. But yes, those two were really runaway hits.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   And the one that you referenced, "Stop crying that there aren't any jobs. Create one,"
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   that one, so that one I wrote, it was a really interesting time because I was a journalist.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:38.560]   That's my work background. So the one office job that I did have, if you could call it
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:45.560]   really an office job, was as a newspaper reporter, which sounds fun and exciting and glamorous.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   And it was. There were definitely moments of it that were fun and exciting and glamorous.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   But the newspaper industry was declining when I entered. I started full-time in 2005, and
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   the industry was already in decline. Craigslist had already decimated most classified ad revenue.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.240]   All the major papers had hiring freezes. Big papers like the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   and the Rocky Mountain News were in the process of shutting down. So yeah, it was sort of
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:31.000]   the equivalent of entering the typewriter industry right at its end.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.880]   I went to a journalism conference, and everybody was gloom and doom, and everybody was so upset
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.400]   about the Internet and how the Internet had just destroyed the industry and destroyed
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:51.280]   newspapers and destroyed opportunity and this and that and the other. And then, coincidentally,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   I happened to fly directly from the journalism conference to a blogging conference. And at
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:04.840]   the blogging conference, everybody's in super high spirits. And everyone's like, "Isn't
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.400]   it great how the Internet has created so much opportunity and there are all these new ways
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.080]   to make money, and there's all this opportunity that wasn't there before."
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:20.080]   And it was funny because at both conferences, the conversation was sort of fundamentally
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:27.340]   around how the Internet has changed the way we work and the way that media works, but
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:35.480]   the tone of the two conferences were so, so different. And so that was what inspired that
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:42.760]   blog post. And I wrote about how at the journalism conference, when I told people that I was
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:48.480]   a freelancer, everyone was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, that's so awful. And you don't
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   even get benefits. You don't get paid time off." And whereas at the blogging conference,
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:05.640]   everyone's like, "Man, that's awesome. You don't have to show up and report to a boss.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   You can work in your underwear. That's sweet." So yeah, it very much highlighted how just
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:26.680]   a shift in mentality and a shift in thinking can literally change your fortunes.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:33.920]   >> Joe: Yeah, I love that. I think there's such a massive shift going on. You know, I
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   am not a journalist, but I see it in journalism very clearly. There's such a massive... Do
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.840]   you read any of James Altuquer's work?
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.640]   >> Ashley: Yes. Yeah, yes, yes.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:52.480]   >> Joe: Okay, so he wrote a book called, which I just finished, called Choose Yourself. I
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:59.360]   think it's called The Choose Yourself Economy. It's his latest book. And he launches into
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   it in a very strong way, but his whole point is that job security is a thing of the past.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:12.320]   The only people, all of us work for ourselves and are going to work for ourselves. And he's
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.840]   pretty strong about it. I'm not quite as strong as he is, but I see that shift happening all
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.280]   throughout the... everywhere. You know, as a journalist, let's say you are a newspaper
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:26.080]   reporter. If you're not building up your own personal following that will go with you from
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.960]   whichever... I don't know what they're called in your business. The masthead, is that what
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.360]   they're called? Whichever name is at the top of your... above the fold?
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.240]   >> Ashley: Yeah.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.640]   >> Joe: If you're not building up your own following, you're going to have trouble. I
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   mean, because all of us ultimately have to take responsibility and ultimately we all
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:48.560]   work for ourselves. It's just that some of us admit it by having our paychecks come from
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:55.560]   multiple employers and some of us don't realize it until we're forced to realize it by our
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.120]   employer and we realize, "Yup, I actually still do work for myself because now this
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.560]   employer is not paying me anymore."
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.160]   >> Ashley: Right, right, right.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   >> Joe: But I love the kick in the seat of the pants. I've seen so many ways that people
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:14.840]   can make money on their own and they can, instead of having to wait, you know, you don't
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.080]   have to wait until you're a millionaire to be financially independent or to live independently.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.840]   All you got to do is... there are tons of ways of doing it. One way is to be really
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.240]   wealthy and live off of dividend income. Another way is simply to create a job for
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.360]   yourself, create a business for yourself. One of my new favorite websites, I'm hoping
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.960]   to interview the author soon. Have you ever heard of the website, reedcraigslist.com?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.520]   >> Ashley: No.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.520]   >> Joe: Fascinating. If you ever want content for your article saying, "Hey, stop crying
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   and create a job," the author of that site, he was a contractor. I think he had three
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.040]   or four kids and he had a bunch of debt, was really struggling financially, but decided
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.200]   the contracting business wasn't going to work for him. So he decided he was going to make
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   his living on Craigslist. For the last number of years, has made his entire living buying
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.360]   and selling things on Craigslist.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   >> Ashley: I have interacted with plenty of people who have done that. As a landlord,
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:30.040]   I'm often on Craigslist looking for a used washing machine or a used this or a used that.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:38.320]   There are plenty of normal, regular everyday people who are selling their appliances on
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   Craigslist, but every now and again I'll stumble upon an ad. From the way it's written, the
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:50.600]   way that they give you the model numbers and the dimensions, and just from the way that
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.640]   the ad is written, you can tell right away, "Oh, this is somebody who does this for a
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   living." I'll actually call the person who's offering that appliance, even if I don't want
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.920]   the particular appliance that they're offering, because I can tell that they're a professional,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   I can tell that they do this for a living, and therefore they could become an ongoing
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:21.560]   contact and an ongoing supplier. As someone who's managing six property units, I'd much
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:29.240]   rather have a Rolodex of ongoing suppliers.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   I know plenty of people who make their entire living off Craigslist. It's a very, very simple
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   way to do it. I love watching them. I love their example. They've literally done it.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:50.600]   They've created a job for themselves.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:57.000]   Using a resource that is completely available to all of us, and yet so many of us don't
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.600]   have a job. I can't create one. You would enjoy that guy's site. Go check it out. He
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:09.120]   actually just wrote a post that I enjoyed very much called basically "How to Start
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.520]   from Zero." If I had zero dollars and didn't have anything to my name, how I would start
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:20.200]   on Craigslist. He walked through, literally from zero dollars, how he would get a bike
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   off of Craigslist by working for one, trading some odd half-day's work or a day's work
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:33.320]   for a bike, and use Craigslist at the library, and kind of walk through this formula.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.800]   To me, that's such a valuable resource. I don't plan to go and make my living on Craigslist.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.840]   Once you change your mentality and you start thinking like an entrepreneur, that I don't
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:49.320]   have to necessarily go and work in a cubicle. There are millions of things that I can do.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:56.080]   I start seeing the options and the opportunities everywhere, absolutely everywhere. You've
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.960]   got to change the mindset. You've got to think like an entrepreneur and not like someone
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.760]   who's looking for a paycheck.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:10.080]   Exactly. One thing that was very powerful for me was just sort of learning where jobs
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:16.680]   came from. I think a lot of people aren't taught to think that way. People sort of grow
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:23.120]   up believing that jobs are just there. Then when you hit that point where you realize,
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:30.040]   "No, wait a minute. Somebody made this. Someone created this, literally out of thin
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:35.960]   air. Here's how they did it." Then it's not a big step to go from that to, "Wait
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.000]   a minute. Now, here's how I could do this for myself. Oh, and wait. Now that I've
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.120]   done it for myself, here's how I can expand that into doing it for myself and other people
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.120]   as well."
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:58.360]   Exactly. I'm with you. It's been fun, Paula. I enjoy your writing. I hope you'll
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.360]   keep it up.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   Thank you.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.520]   Is the blog a creative outlet for you? Is it something that you make money on? Why do
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   you blog?
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:19.280]   Geez, for a number of reasons. I guess it's everything. It's a creative outlet. I do
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:26.560]   make money on it. I hope that I help people with it. I meet some amazing people through
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:34.400]   it, amazing readers who will come to me with questions or with stories. I love interacting
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:45.120]   with readers. For me, I guess my primary benefit from the blog is creating a community
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:55.960]   that's based around these shared principles and values and ideals and hopefully creating
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:05.720]   just a supportive community of people who believe in ruthlessly prioritizing and living
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:15.960]   a life that is simultaneously ambitious and yet unconventional and just writing the script,
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.120]   writing the story of their own lives rather than just going with the flow and doing what's
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   expected of them.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:28.880]   It's exciting to be around a community of people who think like that. To me, that's
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   been a huge value of the Internet is no matter how you think, you can find some other people
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.520]   that think like you do.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   Exactly.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:44.840]   Sometimes that's challenging to find in your own local area, but online you can meet
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:49.440]   those people. It's exciting to be around those people, especially if you can build
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.600]   it around your ideas. It really is.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:59.360]   I remember one other thing I wanted to ask you about because I had first heard, for whatever
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.840]   reason, I wasn't aware of this one, but I thought it was a really useful tip. Save
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:11.880]   an instant 8% on everything. How do I do this?
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:18.080]   There are these websites. There's this industry that's called the secondary gift card market.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.360]   What that is, basically when a person, when Uncle Joe gets a gift card for Christmas that
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.280]   he doesn't like or that he doesn't want, typically what used to happen is that gift
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:34.480]   card would fit in a drawer collecting dust. These websites popped up, but they're called
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.160]   secondary gift card markets. People who have gotten gift cards for stores that just don't
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:46.000]   interest them go online and they'll sell those gift cards at a discount off the face value.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.600]   They might sell a $100 gift card for $90. If that's to a retailer that the buyer is
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.680]   interested in buying from, then it's sort of a win-win because the buyer gets a $100
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:06.440]   gift card for $90 and the seller gets $90, which he would way rather have than this card
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.600]   to a store that he doesn't care about.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:18.720]   I actually buy gift cards for a lot of the stores I shop from, Home Depot, Lowe's,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.560]   Target, Trader Joe's when they're available. The places where I just normally do everyday
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:33.400]   regular shopping, I'll just go online and grab a gift card for it. It's just a really
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:42.120]   great way of saving anywhere from 5% to 15% depending on the retailer. Typically, more
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:48.600]   popular retailers like Target, they're more in demand, they're more popular. So on a Target
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:57.880]   gift card, you might only get 3% to 5% off, which is still worth doing. Whereas a more
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:05.480]   specialized retailer like Sephora, like a store that sells makeup, you could get 15%
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.480]   off.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:14.040]   The thing I like about this strategy is I hadn't previously thought about it, but once
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:19.960]   I went and looked in Plastic Jungle and things like that, if they have the cards available,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.200]   the thing that's beautiful is this strategy can be stacked with some other stuff, other
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.480]   strategies. So if you say, someone like you, you probably do a good bit of business at
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:37.640]   Home Depot and Lowe's. If you can buy these gift cards, you can buy them online and you
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:44.560]   can pay for them using a rewards credit card of some kind with additional cash back for
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:51.480]   the cost of that. You take that, you buy the gift cards, which gives you a discount there.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:57.800]   Then I find it pretty simple and easy to find 10% off coupons with Lowe's near me. So you
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:05.040]   get an additional 10% off with a quick web search a lot of times. And then, even better,
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:10.560]   you're doing all of that for your real estate business. So then we're using deductible dollars.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:19.640]   Right, exactly. You've just told the story of my life for the past couple of years.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:24.400]   You're going to like my new show that's coming out on smart ways to spend money because there's
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:29.880]   little things like that that I think make the difference. Most people that are starting
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.640]   out and kind of building it themselves, all of these little tips and tricks, when you
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:42.720]   start stacking them together, are so beneficial. You can just wander into the local big box
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.640]   store and pay retail or you can think about your purchases. You may still buy from the
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.080]   big box store, but if you do it in some intelligent ways, you can get the same value for a much
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.120]   lower price.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.840]   You might have just inspired a new blog post. I should explain exactly my method for buying
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:08.200]   things at Lowe's because it's very similar to what you described, actually.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:14.160]   I think you could do it in everything. And that's where, kind of going back to the rational
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:21.680]   consumer, it's stupid to say, "Oh, always buy things." Stupid is a strong word. I don't
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.960]   think it's the best idea to say, "Always do this, always do that." I think it's a better
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.680]   idea to teach people, "Here are some of the strategies that you can use," and then allow
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   people to pick and choose.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.000]   Because one time you may buy a washer and dryer off the guy off Craigslist, but the
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.280]   next time you may go ahead and just buy it at Lowe's because of the value that you find
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.320]   there and the strategy you're able to put together. And you'll do it differently in
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.320]   each situation.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:49.320]   Right, right. Exactly. It's all about crunching the numbers. Going back to that mowing the
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:55.240]   lawn thing, there are any number of different ways that you could crunch the numbers on
[00:59:55.240 --> 01:00:03.240]   that, any step of the process, whether it's whether or not to have a yard, where that
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:09.960]   yard is going to be located, how big it's going to be, what you're going to do with
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.680]   it. Yeah, there are so many different options and variables and iterations that it's just
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.720]   – you just can't make any blanket statements one way or the other. There are just way too
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.000]   many variables that all need to be weighed.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.720]   If you can just think clearly about your situation and find the best – find the thing that
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.920]   really works for the situation that's in front of you, that's the way to win the
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   game.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   Absolutely. Were there any additional steps to your Lowe's strategy I missed?
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:52.920]   Yeah. Go on upromise.com. If you go on upromise, set up an account there and then go through
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.360]   them to make a purchase at Lowe's, you'll get an additional 5% off. And so what I'll
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:12.280]   do is I will buy a discounted gift card for Lowe's, then I'll log on to YouPromise.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:17.160]   Through YouPromise, I'll connect to Lowe's. So then when I make the purchase, I get 5%
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.360]   off, but then I'm paying with a gift card as well. So that gift card gives me another
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.840]   10% off. And then I'm paying with a credit card that gives me frequent flyer miles, which
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:33.240]   by the way, allowed me to fly to Paris for free the last trip that I took, country number
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   29.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.160]   I like it. And don't forget, obviously for most of this, this will be a business, you're
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160]   paying it through.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.960]   Yeah. And it's all a business expense.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:56.360]   And then hopefully I won't – hopefully then you also do a good job of keeping separate
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:02.400]   receipts marking your improvements versus your repairs so that you can fully deduct
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   most of them as if possible, the repairs as repairs, and then you have to amortize the
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.120]   improvements on a rental property. But that's another little thing that I've observed that
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.080]   a lot of real estate investors aren't aware of.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:22.680]   Yeah. We have a CPA who gets burdened with all of our receipts once a year.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:28.880]   Good. So just a little trick that I've talked to people about is always make sure if you're
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.200]   buying $100 worth of things at Lowe's and let's say 50 of them are to make an improvement
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:39.400]   on your property and $50 is for something that is classified as – let's say it's
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.240]   $10,000 worth at Lowe's. $5,000 of it is something that's classified as an improvement
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.120]   and $5,000 of it is for a simple roof repair. You want to make sure you get separate receipts
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.520]   for all the things that you're buying for repairs versus improvements and you want to
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.000]   keep that separate accounting. Most people don't do it. They just check out everything
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.800]   and it's kind of all mixed up. But just for those who don't know, it's real estate.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.440]   You can fully deduct all repairs to a property on rental real estate. You can fully deduct
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.240]   all your repairs to a property in the year that you make them against your earned income
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:21.760]   whereas your improvements have to be amortized out over the IRS tables. So that's the exact
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.200]   opposite of what you want to do for your personal house. So on your personal house, if you're
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.800]   spending money at Lowe's, if things are for repairs, you can't do it. That's not
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.440]   deductible because it's for your personal house. But if things are for an improvement
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.840]   on your house, that will increase your tax basis for when the time comes that you can
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.840]   sell it. So I got a little technical there, but it's all these little things, they
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.200]   add up when you start adding them up.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.840]   They do. They definitely do.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.680]   I like it. I like the "you promised" angle. And it could probably be even stacked
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.120]   on that you could find a, I don't know, can you do some kind of price match strategy?
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.920]   "Hey, Home Depot's selling this for this much. I wonder if Lowe's does that." I've
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.400]   never looked into that, but I bet they probably would.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.960]   Very cool. Anything that I missed? Anything you'd like to add?
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960]   No, I think we're good.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   Cool.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:21.000]   I appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule to do this. And let's see, where
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.240]   can people find you on the web? Affordanything.com? Where else?
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.360]   Affordanything.com. I'm on the web in a bunch of different places, but that's my
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:34.720]   primary site, so come visit me there. And if you do want to hear me on another podcast,
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:43.080]   I do make an appearance every week on the Stacking Benjamins podcast. It's a very
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.840]   long podcast. It goes on for more than an hour, but there's a brief moment at the
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.040]   end of each show where they do a roundtable discussion with four bloggers, one of whom
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:59.920]   is me. So I'm the token girl on the show. So you can tune in and hear me there if you're
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.320]   more into listening to podcasts than you are into reading.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   I'll find a link to that. I haven't listened to their show, but I'll find a link and
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   put it in the show notes.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320]   Cool.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.320]   Thank you, Paula.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   All right. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for having me on. This has been fun.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.200]   All right. And with that, this has been the Radical Personal Finance Podcast with Joshua
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.320]   Sheets and Paula from Affordanything.
