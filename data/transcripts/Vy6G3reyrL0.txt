[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   [silence]
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.020]   One of the biggest lies in the universe
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.200]   that seems quite prominent right now
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.100]   is that every experience you have changes your brain.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.260]   People love to say this.
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.140]   They love to say,
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.460]   "Your brain is going to be different after this lecture.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.800]   Your brain is going to be different after today's class
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800]   than it was two days ago."
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.160]   And that's absolutely not true.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.400]   The nervous system doesn't just change
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.580]   because you experienced something
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.100]   unless you're a very young child.
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.420]   The nervous system changes when certain neurochemicals
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.560]   are released and allow whatever neurons are active
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.980]   in the period in which those chemicals are swimming around
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.120]   to strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.900]   Now, this is best illustrated
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.680]   through a little bit of scientific history.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.200]   The whole basis of neuroplasticity
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.680]   is essentially ascribed to two individuals,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.880]   although there were a lot more people
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.940]   that were involved in this work.
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.040]   Those two individuals go by the name David Hubel
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.880]   and Torsten Wiesel.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.140]   David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.760]   started off at Johns Hopkins,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   moved to Harvard Medical School.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.280]   And in the '70s and '80s,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.120]   they did a series of experiments
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.740]   recording electrical activity in the brain.
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.800]   They were in the visual cortex,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.840]   meaning they put the electrodes in the visual cortex,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840]   and they were exploring how vision works
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.500]   and how the visual brain organizes all the features
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.340]   of the visual world
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.460]   as these incredible things we call visual perceptions.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.640]   But Hubel was a physician,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.000]   and he was very interested in what happens
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.080]   when, for instance, a child comes into the world
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.600]   and they have a cataract.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.920]   The lens of their eye isn't clear, but it's opaque.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.360]   Or when a kid has a lazy eye
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.200]   or the eyes have what's called strabismus,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.180]   which is when the eyes either deviate outward or inward.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.160]   These are very common things of childhood,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.580]   especially in particular areas of the world.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.160]   And what David and Torsten did is they figured out
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.000]   that there was a critical period
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.040]   in which if clear vision did not occur,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.480]   the visual brain would completely rewire itself
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.760]   basically to represent
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.800]   whatever bit of visual information was coming in.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500]   So they did these experiments
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.320]   that kind of simulate a droopy eye or a deviating eye
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.640]   where they would close one eyelid.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   And then what they found is that the visual brain
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.720]   would respond entirely to the open eye.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.040]   There was sort of a takeover of the visual brain
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.120]   representing the open eye.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.200]   Many experiments in many different sensory systems
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.500]   followed up on this.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.560]   There are beautiful experiments, for instance,
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.480]   from Greg Rechenzohn's lab up at UC Davis
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.960]   and Mike Merzenich's labs at UCSF
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.380]   showing that, for instance,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.800]   if two fingers were taped together early in development,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.520]   so they weren't moving independently,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.120]   the representation of those two fingers
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.640]   would become fused in the brain
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.620]   so that the person couldn't actually distinguish
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.960]   the movements and the sensations
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.160]   of the two fingers separately, pretty remarkable.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.500]   All of this is to say that David and Torsten's work,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.400]   for which they won a Nobel prize,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040]   they shared it with Roger Sperry,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.520]   their work showed that the brain is in fact
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.400]   a customized map of the outside world,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.740]   we said that already,
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.200]   but that what it's doing is it's measuring
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.760]   the amount of activity for a given part of our body,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000]   one eye or the other, or our fingers,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.180]   this finger or that finger,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.740]   and all of those inputs are competing
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.840]   for space in the brain.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.760]   Now, this is fundamentally important
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.600]   because what it means is that
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.000]   if we are to change our nervous system in adulthood,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.720]   we need to think about not just what we're trying to get,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.020]   but what we're trying to give up.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.240]   We can't actually add new connections
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.560]   without removing something else.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.060]   And that might seem like kind of a stinger,
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.560]   but it actually turns out to be a great advantage.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.920]   One of the key experiments that David and Torsten did
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   was an experiment where they closed both eyes,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.780]   where they essentially removed all visual input
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.020]   early in development.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.600]   Now, this is slightly different than blindness
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.720]   because it was transient,
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.520]   it was only for a short period of time,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.440]   but what they found is when they did that,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.700]   there was no change.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.200]   However, if they closed just one eye,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960]   there was a huge change.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.400]   So when people tell you,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.200]   oh, at the end of today's lecture,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.540]   at the end of something,
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.660]   your brain is going to be completely different,
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.720]   that's simply not true.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.080]   If you're older than 25,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.940]   your brain will not change
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.520]   unless there's a selective shift in your attention
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.280]   or a selective shift in your experience
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.040]   that tells the brain it's time to change.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.320]   And those changes occur through the ways
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.140]   I talked about before,
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.380]   strengthening and weakening of particular connections.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.120]   They have names like long-term potentiation,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.000]   long-term depression,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.680]   which has nothing to do with emotional depression,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.920]   by the way, spike timing dependent plasticity.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.340]   I threw out those names not to confuse you,
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.000]   but for those of you that would like
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.280]   more in-depth exploration of those,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.600]   please, you can go Google those and look them up.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.120]   There are great Wikipedia pages for them
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.480]   and you can go down the paper trail.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.160]   I might even touch on them in some subsequent episodes.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.240]   But the important thing to understand
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.560]   is that if we want something to change,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.880]   we really need to bring an immense amount of attention
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.040]   to whatever it is that we want to change.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.520]   This is very much linked to the statement I made earlier
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.540]   about it all starts with an awareness.
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.080]   Now, why is that attention important?
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.280]   Well, David and Tornsten won their Nobel prize
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.160]   and they certainly deserve it.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.040]   They probably deserve two
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.640]   because they also figured out how vision works.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.840]   And I might be biased
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.340]   'cause they're my scientific great-grandparents,
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.320]   but I think everybody in the field of neuroscience agrees
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.200]   that Hubel and Wiesel, as they're called,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.600]   H and W for those in the game,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.100]   absolutely deserved a Nobel prize for their work
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.640]   because they really unveiled the mechanisms
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.840]   of brain change, of plasticity.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.900]   Hubel and Wiesel did an amazing thing for science
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.500]   that will forever change the way
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.180]   that we think about the brain.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.560]   However, they were quite wrong
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.620]   about this critical period thing.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.820]   The critical period was this idea
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.300]   that if you were to deprive the nervous system of an input,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.220]   say, closing one eye early in development,
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.620]   and the rest of the visual cortex is taken over
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.640]   by the representation of the open eye,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.820]   that you could never change that unless you intervened early.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.440]   And this actually formed the basis for why a kid
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.040]   that has a lazy eye or a cataract,
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.740]   why even though there's some issues
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.960]   with anesthesia in young children,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.600]   why now we know that you want to get in there early
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.280]   and fix the cataract or fix the strabismus.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.520]   That's what ophthalmologists do.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.860]   However, their idea that you had to do it early
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.600]   or else there was no opportunity
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   to rescue the nervous system deficit later on,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.000]   turned out wasn't entirely true.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.580]   In the early '90s, a graduate student
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.980]   by the name of Greg Reckensohn was in the laboratory
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.820]   of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.440]   And they set out to test this idea
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.020]   that if one wants to change their brain,
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.580]   they need to do it early in life
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.980]   because the adult brain simply isn't plastic.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.620]   It's not available for these changes.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.140]   And they did a series of absolutely beautiful experiments.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.660]   By now, I think we can say proving
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.160]   that the adult brain can change
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.720]   provided certain conditions are met.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.080]   Now, the experiments they did are tough.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.360]   They were tough on the experimenter
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.820]   and they were tough on the subject.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.100]   I'll just describe one.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.820]   Let's say you were a subject in one of their experiments.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.960]   You would come into the lab and you'd sit down at a table
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.340]   and they would record from or image your brain
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.480]   and look at the representation of your fingers,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.600]   the digits as we call them.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.280]   And there would be a spinning drum,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.240]   literally like a stone drum in front of you
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.360]   or metal drum that had little bumps.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   Some of the bumps were spaced close together,
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.320]   some of them were spaced far apart.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.980]   And they would do these experiments
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.160]   where they would expect their subjects
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.440]   to press a lever whenever, for instance,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.960]   the bumps got closer together or further apart.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.760]   And these were very subtle differences.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.600]   So in order to do this,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.640]   you really have to pay attention
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.560]   to the distance between the bumps.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.160]   And these were not braille readers
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.020]   or anyone skilled in doing these kinds of experiments.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.080]   What they found was that as people paid
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.720]   more and more attention to the distance between these bumps
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.200]   and they would signal when there was a change
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.120]   by pressing a lever.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.800]   As they did that, there was very rapid changes,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.080]   plasticity in the representation of the fingers.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.680]   And it could go in either direction.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.240]   You could get people very good
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.740]   at detecting the distance between bumps
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.240]   that the distance was getting smaller
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.600]   or the distance was getting greater.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.440]   So people could get very good at these tasks
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.000]   that you're kind of hard to imagine
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.480]   how they would translate to the real world
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.740]   for a non-braille reader.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.100]   But what it told us is that these maps of touch
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.540]   were very much available for plasticity.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.000]   And these were fully adult subjects.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   They're not taking any specific drugs.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.560]   They don't have any impairments that we're aware of.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.960]   And what it showed,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.720]   what it proved is that the adult brain is very plastic.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.880]   And they did some beautiful control experiments
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.920]   that are important for everyone to understand,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.560]   which is that sometimes they would bring people in
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.360]   and they would have them touch these bumps
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.000]   on this spinning drum,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.640]   but they would have the person pay attention
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.880]   to an auditory cue.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.320]   Every time a tone would go off
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.840]   or there was a shift in the pitch of that tone,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.120]   they would have to signal that.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.900]   So the subject thought they were doing something related
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.740]   to touch and hearing.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.560]   And all that showed was that it wasn't just the mere action
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.280]   of touching these bumps.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.560]   They had to pay attention to the bumps themselves.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.700]   If they were placing their attention
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.780]   on the auditory cue on the tone,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.300]   well, then there was plasticity
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.200]   in the auditory portion of the brain,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.080]   but not on the touch portion of the brain.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.760]   And this really spits in the face of this thing
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.420]   that you hear so often,
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.040]   which is every experience that you have
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.840]   is going to change the way your brain works.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.080]   Absolutely not.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.560]   The experiences that you pay super careful attention to
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.600]   are what open up plasticity.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.300]   And it opens up plasticity to that specific experience.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.840]   (upbeat music)
