[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   "I love Jesus, but my heart is drawn to spend too much time with entertainment.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   How do I break the hold entertainment has on my heart?"
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   That was a question sent in to Pastor John in Desiring God a few years back,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   and it was a question Pastor John addressed at the time. Here's what he said.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   That's a very good question.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And I think it's especially relevant because we live, I think, more now than ever
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   in a day when entertaining kinds of things are immediately accessible.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I was thinking the other day of the difference between our temptations and,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   say, 300 years ago, 250 years ago, the day of Jonathan Edwards.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Edwards would write about the folly of young people getting together to do
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   frivolous conversation or other worse things, bundling it was called,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   getting in bed with each other and keep your clothes on, that sort of thing,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   just spice up life a little bit. Life gets boring in New England 250 years ago.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Today, we carry in our pockets radio, television, Internet, and games,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and anything that would be titillating, just fun.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And fun is a word in the church today that's just rampant. It's an adjective.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's a noun. It's a verb. Because we do ministry in order to fit this mentality.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So I'm deeply concerned about that. I want to stand for seriousness about God
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   instead of making him palatable by making him fun,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   turning him into another piece of entertainment.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So this question is, how do you break free from that kind of addiction?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Well, recognizing it is a huge step in the right direction.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Second, I would say, seek the Lord earnestly about it.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Pray like crazy that God would open your eyes to see wondrous things out of his law.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Third, I would say, immerse yourself in the Bible, even when you don't feel like it,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   pleading with God to open your eyes to see what's really there.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Then I'd say, get in a group where you talk about serious things.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And then I would say, begin to share your faith.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   One of the reasons we are not as moved by our own faith as we are
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   is because we almost never talk about it to any unbeliever.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It starts to feel like a kind of hothouse thing,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and then starts to have a feeling of unreality about it,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and then the powers of entertainment have more sway in our life.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And so those would be some of the things.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But ultimately, it's a gift of grace to feel the glory of God.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   One last suggestion. Think about your death. Think about your death a lot.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Ask what you'd like to be doing in the season of life, or hours, or days,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   leading up to meeting Christ.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I do that a lot these days.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I think about the impact of death and what I would like to be found doing,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and how I would prepare to meet Him and give an account to Him.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   What a sobering thought to end with.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And for more on the role of the spiritual affections in the Christian life,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   there's an episode where Pastor John explains the four levels of our spiritual affections,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and that's episode number 264. It's worth checking out.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And we will be back on Monday with a new episode based on a listener question,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   a question emailed in from you, the listeners.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So please keep sending in those excellent questions.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Send them to askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And please visit us online at desiringgod.org to find thousands of books, articles, sermons,

[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a great weekend.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   [end]
