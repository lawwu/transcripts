[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.560]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.520]   Today, we are discussing microplastics.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.800]   Microplastics are an extremely interesting
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.840]   and important topic that everyone should know about.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.840]   And the reason is microplastics are indeed everywhere.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.000]   They're in the air.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.560]   They are in beverages we consume.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280]   They are lining the inside of soup cans.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.000]   They are lining the inside of paper cups
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.260]   made to hold hot water, coffee, and tea.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.360]   And there are a lot of animal data
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.400]   and indeed some human data showing that microplastics,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.760]   which consist of particles of different sizes,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.360]   can be very detrimental to our health.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.640]   At the same time, it's important to realize that as of now,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.000]   we don't have any causal data
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.400]   linking microplastics to specific human diseases.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.780]   That said, there's a lot of correlative data,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.120]   and today we are going to review those correlative data.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360]   And most importantly, we are going to discuss
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.720]   the various things that we can each and all do
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.960]   to limit our exposure to microplastics,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.200]   or at least to facilitate the removal of microplastics
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.480]   from our body.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.720]   Because, as we'll soon discuss,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.900]   you have microplastics in essentially every organ
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.160]   and tissue of your body right now,
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.440]   and you are constantly being bombarded with microplastics.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.280]   So the challenge for me, and indeed for you as well,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600]   is to frame this topic of microplastics accurately.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   It's important that we understand they are out there,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.560]   they are in us,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.440]   and indeed they can cause serious issues for our health.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.860]   However, we also need to take agency.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.120]   We need to understand how we can limit
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.000]   what's called the bioaccumulation of microplastics
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.640]   in our organs and tissues.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.560]   And I don't want to be alarmist.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.820]   Today's episode is not about getting you to be petrified
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.440]   or about developing some sort of hypochondriasis
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.280]   about microplastics.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.820]   It's designed to inform you about what they are,
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.080]   where they exist,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.400]   where they exist in particularly high amounts,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.680]   and the things that you can do
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.840]   to limit their impact on your biology.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.280]   Because I think it's fair to say
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.020]   that we are not going to rid the earth of microplastics.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.780]   They are just too pervasive.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.520]   Now, the one caveat is that
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.020]   there are certain populations of people,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.920]   in particular people that are pregnant
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.540]   or people that have young children
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.320]   and those young children themselves,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.420]   that should really strive
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.500]   to limit their exposure to microplastics.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.860]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.580]   you can be confident that you'll understand a lot
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.980]   about what microplastics are,
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.140]   the impact that they are currently having,
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.460]   some of the potential impact
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.900]   that people are starting to investigate,
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140]   and ways that you can limit their negative impact
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.060]   on your brain and bodily health.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.000]   Before you begin,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.780]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.400]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.800]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.900]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.340]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.800]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.360]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.620]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.000]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.460]   in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.600]   Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.580]   about the critical importance of hydration
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.740]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.460]   Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.380]   can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.700]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.440]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.980]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.380]   are critical for the functioning
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.580]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.580]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.020]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.660]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.100]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.020]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.180]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.780]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.500]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.680]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.660]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.740]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.860]   Element has a lot of different
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.440]   great-tasting flavors of Element.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.900]   My favorite is the watermelon,
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.860]   although I also confess I like the raspberry
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.860]   and the citrus.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.900]   Basically, I like all the flavors of Element.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.100]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.820]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.660]   spelled drinkelment.com/huberman,

[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.660]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.820]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.380]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.240]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.700]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.640]   Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.300]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.940]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school,
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.440]   but pretty soon I realized that therapy
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.980]   is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.980]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.540]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.420]   including cardiovascular exercise
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.380]   and resistance training exercise,
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.460]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.800]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.140]   that great therapy provides.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.480]   First, it provides a good rapport with somebody
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.420]   that you can really trust and talk to
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.620]   about any and all issues that concern you.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.020]   Second of all, great therapy provides support
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.700]   in the form of emotional support,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.140]   but also directed guidance, the do's and the not to do's.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.120]   And third, expert therapy can help you arrive
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.540]   at useful insights that you would not have arrived
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.540]   at otherwise, insights that allow you to do better,
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.180]   not just in your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.820]   but also the relationship to yourself
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.660]   and your professional life and all sorts of career goals.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.180]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.440]   to find an expert therapist
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.060]   with whom you can really resonate with
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.460]   and provide you with these three benefits that I described.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.900]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.300]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.420]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.860]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.460]   Okay, let's talk about microplastics.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.540]   What are microplastics?
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.220]   Microplastics, as the name suggests,
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.000]   are little itty-bitty bits of plastic.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.240]   How itty-bitty?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.620]   Well, microplastics range in size from one micron,
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.900]   which is one one-thousandth of a millimeter,
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.860]   all the way up to five millimeters in diameter.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.340]   Okay, so anything in that size range
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.220]   is considered a microplastic.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.740]   Anything smaller than that,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.860]   so anything smaller than one micron in diameter,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.980]   one one-thousandth of a millimeter in diameter,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.340]   is considered a nanoplastic.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.820]   And indeed, there are lots of microplastics
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.420]   floating around in the air.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.060]   There are lots of nanoplastics floating around in the air.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.680]   There's lots of both of those things in the ocean.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.260]   There are a lot of those things in food,
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.900]   especially packaged food.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.580]   There are a lot of those things lining cups.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.180]   There are a lot of those things
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.020]   in everything that we consume, essentially.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.900]   So what does it mean to have all these microplastics
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.220]   and nanoplastics floating around in our environment
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.540]   and going into our body through fluids and foods, et cetera?
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.940]   Well, there is some serious concern
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.820]   because these microplastics
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.020]   potentially can disrupt cellular health, organ health,
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.220]   and could potentially lead to certain forms of disease.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.660]   We'll talk about the ways they could potentially do that.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.100]   However, I want to also emphasize
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.620]   that your body is incredibly good
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.660]   at dealing with foreign invaders.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.260]   It's very good at getting rid of stuff
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.640]   that isn't good for it.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.460]   However, microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.660]   have been shown to lodge within specific tissues
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.140]   and stay there for long periods of time.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.980]   So you'll notice during today's episode,
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.020]   I'm going to go back and forth
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.140]   between the stuff that's really scary
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.740]   and then reassuring you that we're not sure
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.420]   whether or not we need to be that scared
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.980]   about these microplastics and nanoplastics yet.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.740]   Okay, what I want to do is give you the evidence
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.700]   so you can decide how much effort you put
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.460]   into limiting your exposure
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.180]   to these microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.100]   and how much effort you put
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.140]   into trying to rid your body of them.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.180]   Okay, I'm not here to paint the picture one way or the other
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.740]   because frankly, the data just don't line up
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.860]   with one argument or the other,
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.180]   that they're extremely dangerous
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.240]   or that they're nothing to worry about.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.820]   Let me give you an example
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.620]   of something that you might've heard in the media
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.100]   and on recent podcasts out there that's very scary.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.660]   The argument based on what seemed
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.500]   to be a pretty high quality publication
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.840]   that you may have heard is that every single week,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.460]   we ingest up to a credit card's worth
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.700]   of microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.100]   Okay, you might've seen that in headlines
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.580]   and in other podcasts.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.400]   And indeed, there was a paper arguing that.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.360]   However, a more recent paper looked
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.640]   at the quantitative analysis they used,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.080]   used a different quantitative analysis
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.900]   and claimed that they vastly overestimated
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.340]   the amount of plastic that we ingest every week.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.260]   What do I mean by vastly overestimated?
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.800]   This newer analysis of the same data claims
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.420]   that the credit card's worth of plastic
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.540]   that it was argued we consume every week,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.540]   well, that was an overestimate by a million fold.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.100]   And in fact, it would take 23,000 years
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.980]   to consume enough plastic to lead
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.740]   to that credit card's worth of plastic in our bodies.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.300]   Okay, so now we have very discrepant data,
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.780]   or rather we have very discrepant analyses of the same data.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.940]   So you're starting to get a picture
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.180]   of just how confusing this whole field is,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.360]   but we're going to parse it a little bit further
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.700]   by saying that it's also very clear
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.980]   that microplastics and nanoplastics are everywhere.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.060]   Okay, they're just everywhere you look.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.060]   In fact, if I were a PhD advisor for somebody in toxicology
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.520]   or a PhD advisor for somebody in environmental science,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.820]   and they needed to have a surefire publication,
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.140]   I'd probably suggest that they work on microplastics
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.940]   and go out there and try and find
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.740]   yet another source of microplastics
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.540]   and use a better analysis, for instance.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.100]   Okay, doing a graduate thesis
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.600]   isn't just about getting a publication,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.380]   but what I'm trying to refer to here
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.720]   is that wherever people look for microplastics,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.020]   they find them.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.340]   This is true in our environment,
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.860]   and this is true in food, this is true in water,
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.900]   and this is also true for our tissues.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.020]   So in the last couple of years,
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.860]   there's been an explosion
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.440]   in the number of scientific studies
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.940]   exploring which tissues of the human body,
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.980]   so not just animal models,
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.600]   but the human body contain microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.960]   Okay, so by examining post-mortem tissues,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.260]   that is tissues from people who are deceased,
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.660]   it's been discovered that there are microplastics
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.660]   and nanoplastics lodged in the brain.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.020]   So if you take the brain of a deceased adult human,
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.900]   what you find is that they have about 0.5%
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.660]   of the total weight of the brain from microplastics.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.780]   So this is about a teaspoon
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.340]   of salt or sugars worth of microplastics,
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.900]   might not seem like much,
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.600]   but if you think about how little neurons are,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.880]   a typical neuron will have a cell body,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.420]   this is the area that contains the nucleus
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.660]   with all the DNA and so forth,
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.540]   that cell bodies of neurons vary in size tremendously,
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.400]   they can be as small as five to eight microns across
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.540]   to as much as, gosh,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.500]   I've seen some neurons down the microscope
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.240]   that are 50 microns,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.940]   I've seen some that are 100 microns across,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.080]   it depends where you look in the nervous system.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.640]   Okay, so if you start to think about a half teaspoon
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.280]   of powder of microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.740]   that's a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.700]   that could be distributed
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.640]   in lots of different places in the brain.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.480]   And a little bit later,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.440]   we'll talk about what the potential impact is
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.820]   of these microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.100]   on the function of particular types of neurons
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.480]   that may impact things like neurodevelopmental trajectories,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.400]   okay, the argument has been made,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.800]   I'm not making this argument,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.320]   but the argument has been made
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.240]   that microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.640]   may correlate with things like autism,
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.900]   may correlate with things like attention deficit
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.460]   hyperactivity disorder,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.840]   I don't actually believe that the data there
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.280]   are strong enough to make those arguments at all.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.640]   However, I will tell you that the presence of microplastics
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.960]   and nanoplastics in the brains that is post-mortem tissue,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.600]   okay, so deceased people taking the brain,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.440]   chopping up the brain,
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600]   looking at it down the microscope and seeing microplastics
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.280]   and then quantifying the amount of microplastics
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.600]   in different compartments of the brain
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.840]   and distributed across the brain,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.920]   that is concerning to me in the sense
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.240]   that there's enough of it in there
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.100]   and the function of neurons in the nervous system
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.280]   is precise enough that you could imagine
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.200]   given that these microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.500]   are lodged in particular categories of neurons
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.080]   that do in fact impact things like reward and motivation,
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.980]   things like movement, et cetera,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.440]   that they could be impacting
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.880]   the function of the nervous system,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.880]   but there's no direct causal relationship,
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.280]   at least not in humans.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.180]   There's some interesting data in animal models,
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.680]   we'll get back to that a little bit later.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.640]   So there's microplastics and nanoplastics in brain,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.560]   you'll find microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.800]   in other tissues that have a blood organ barrier.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.640]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.800]   Well, the brain is encapsulated in the so-called BBB,
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.280]   the blood brain barrier,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.360]   and that's because your brain tissue,
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.720]   because it doesn't turn over across the lifespan,
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.280]   you don't produce many new neurons.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.760]   There are a few places you produce new neurons
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.920]   like the olfactory bulb,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.220]   the dentate gyrus or the hippocampus, a few places,
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.080]   but these are far and few between.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.240]   Most of your brain tissue that you're born with
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.020]   is the brain tissue that you're going to die with,
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.480]   provided you don't lose that brain tissue
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.660]   through the course of your lifespan,
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.320]   through a head injury or something like that.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.760]   The neurons you have when you are born
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.060]   actually are far more numerous than the neurons you have
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.520]   at the time when you die.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.360]   This is important,
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.880]   and it's one of the reasons we have a blood brain barrier.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.520]   Nature is very smart.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.680]   It designed a barrier so that molecules
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.920]   that might be dangerous to the brain can't enter the brain,
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.840]   and that's what the BBB is for.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.240]   Microplastics and nanoplastics are making it
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.160]   from the bloodstream into the brain, okay?
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.000]   This is what I mean
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.880]   when I say they can cross the blood brain barrier.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.720]   Then if we take a step back and we ask ourselves,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.640]   what are some other tissues in the body
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.600]   that have a very robust barrier from the blood?
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.040]   'Cause a lot of things get into the blood,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.180]   and that's not necessarily good,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.980]   but it's not necessarily bad
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.520]   if you can excrete those things, right?
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.440]   We have a lot of detoxification mechanisms
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.920]   that include our liver detoxification, et cetera.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.960]   But if these particles are getting
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.120]   from the blood into the brain,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   what are some other tissues that they're getting into
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.760]   that have these thick barriers
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.400]   or these very stringent barriers?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.660]   As you can imagine,
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.800]   two other tissues that have very stringent
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.280]   blood to organ barriers are the blood testicular barrier.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.440]   Why would that be?
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.680]   Okay, why would you protect brain?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.760]   Well, it can't renew.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.800]   You don't want those neurons
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.340]   to get contaminated with things,
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.900]   so you put a BBB in, a blood brain barrier.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.400]   You also put a blood testicular barrier in males.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.240]   Why?
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.840]   Well, that's where the DNA are.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.520]   That's where the so-called germ cells are.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.440]   So you don't want things getting into the testicle
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800]   and mutating the DNA there,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.520]   because then those mutated DNA
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.820]   could be passed on to offspring.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.660]   Guess what?
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.360]   Microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.760]   can cross the blood testicular barrier.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.560]   And in fact, there was a lot of press this last year
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.280]   about microplastics and nanoplastics being present
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.040]   in every human testicle that was analyzed in,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.280]   or I should say from postmortem tissue.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.400]   Likewise, there's a blood follicle barrier in females.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.520]   Okay, this is where the eggs come from.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.000]   And microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.800]   can cross the blood follicular barrier.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.560]   So this is why people are starting to get concerned, right?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.700]   I suppose we shouldn't be so surprised
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.120]   that we're inhaling microplastics,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.240]   given that they are everywhere.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.280]   I should mention that, you know,
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.240]   there wasn't much plastic around or in use
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.560]   prior to the 1950s.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.400]   If any of you have ever seen the movie "The Graduate"
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.000]   with Dustin Hoffman,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.200]   this is the only time you'll see somebody driving eastward
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.440]   across the Bay Bridge, all right,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.300]   from San Francisco toward Berkeley on the top deck.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.480]   It actually runs in the other direction.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.460]   They shut down the Bay Bridge.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.300]   That's in "The Graduate."
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.820]   And the other thing that's in "The Graduate"
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.080]   is this famous scene.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.160]   If you're old enough like me
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.440]   to remember the movie "The Graduate,"
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.120]   Dustin Hoffman's lying in the pool.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.920]   It's after his graduation.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.760]   He's lying in the pool.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.720]   He doesn't really know what he's going to do with his life.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.860]   And this guy comes up to him and he says,
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.440]   "You know, the future is plastics."
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.600]   And it became this kind of famous line or pseudo-famous line.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.400]   Now that movie takes place at a time
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.800]   when plastics were really booming as an industry.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.960]   And indeed, polyethylene, polyurethane,
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.980]   these plastic materials were developed
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.360]   because they were very durable.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.200]   They were long lasting.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.220]   In fact, they are not biodegradable.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.440]   They're not broken down very easily, if at all,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.000]   and certainly not within biological tissues.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.560]   These plastics went from essentially non-existent
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.720]   in the 1940s and prior
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.360]   to in pretty much everything involved in manufacturing, okay?
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   Even in different aspects of surgical implants
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.200]   and things of that sort.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.680]   So plastics are indeed everywhere.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.120]   And that started in the 1950s,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.720]   hence that line from "The Graduate."
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.740]   So it's not surprising that microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.480]   would get into our body, right?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.960]   If they're everywhere in our environment
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.060]   and we're inhaling them all day,
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.520]   then of course they'll get into our lungs
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.760]   and then they're small enough
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.920]   they can get into our bloodstream.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.360]   But as I mentioned, the body has these cleansing systems
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.560]   or these detoxification systems to remove things,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.640]   but they're not removing the microplastics,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.760]   or at least not all of them,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.000]   from brain, testicle, and follicle.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.960]   And I should point out that microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.560]   are also found in all the other tissues of the body.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.400]   In fact, I don't think there's a single investigation
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200]   of human tissue or animal tissue
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.780]   for microplastics or nanoplastics
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.880]   where they didn't get a positive result,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.600]   meaning where they didn't find them in the tissue.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.880]   You can find them in not just the upper lungs,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.960]   but in the lower lungs.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.860]   So they're getting deposited in the lower lungs.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.760]   You can find them in the bloodstream from a blood draw.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.120]   You can find them in human placenta,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.740]   and you can find them in what's called the meconium,
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.680]   which is the first stool that a baby takes.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.900]   This is typically taken within the,
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.880]   or the stool is given, given, taken.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.960]   It's taken by the doctor.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.480]   It's actually analyzed for various things.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.320]   It contains bile and a bunch of other things.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.000]   It's actually an important indicator
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.500]   of the health of the child.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.800]   It turns out that this first stool,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.400]   that happens in the first 24 hours or so after birth,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.020]   when that's been analyzed for microplastics,
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.520]   there too, you find microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.760]   And that's really got people concerned
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.600]   because what this means is that microplastics
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.160]   and nanoplastics that mothers are ingesting
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.940]   or that they somehow have lodged in their bodies
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.840]   are making their way to the fetus.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.240]   Now you could say, well, is it really a problem?
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.560]   Well, a few years ago, it was at least concerning enough
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.960]   that BPAs, and we'll talk more about BPAs,
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.000]   bisphenol A, which is a component of microplastics.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.240]   This is a known endocrine disruptor.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   It disrupts certain estrogen-like pathways.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.380]   We'll get into this in a few minutes.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.900]   Bisphenol A and BPAs were banned from sippy cups in kids
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.520]   and from any food containers for young kids.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   So the FDA in the United States,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.800]   and there are European countries as well,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.400]   had enough data on this or enough concern about this
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.600]   to say, listen, we are going to make it illegal
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.040]   to have BPA-lined sippy cups
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.800]   or food containers for young kids,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.760]   in part because the BPA is correlated
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.040]   with microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.160]   So what I'm saying here is that the government
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.540]   has taken pretty avid measures
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.480]   to restrict the amount of BPA exposure
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   through microplastics and nanoplastics to young kids,
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.920]   and yet the fetus clearly is being exposed
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.360]   to microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.760]   This is why at the beginning I mentioned,
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.660]   if you are pregnant or if you have young kids,
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.080]   or if you are a young kid,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.840]   you want to go out of your way to limit your exposure
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.800]   to these microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.760]   But if you're an older adult,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.960]   you probably want to do the same,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.220]   and we'll talk about ways that you can do that.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.240]   So I could go on and on about the various tissues,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.480]   besides placenta in your bloodstream,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.960]   brain, testes, follicle, lower lungs.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.360]   You can find nanoplastics in the liver.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.720]   You can find microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.680]   in pretty much every tissue that you look for them.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.860]   The real question is,
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.320]   how detrimental are these microplastics and nanoplastics?
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.600]   And then of course we can talk about
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.900]   where they're coming from specifically,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.620]   in ways that you can control and limit.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.040]   And when I say control and limit,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.600]   what we're really talking about here is,
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.160]   yes, trying to limit your exposure to these things.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.040]   If I were to rattle off the different sources
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.600]   of microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.200]   you would go wide-eyed,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.080]   and you would probably also just say,
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.940]   okay, I surrender, they're truly everywhere.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.720]   In fact, I'll do that, okay, I can't help, but do that.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.440]   But keep in mind, you do have some control
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.920]   in terms of the end result of these microplastics
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.160]   and nanoplastics on your health.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.400]   So here I go.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.680]   Plastic bags, storage containers,
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.480]   bottle caps, rope gear strapping,
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.560]   utensils, cups, floats, coolers, containers,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.440]   rope, fishing nets, textiles.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.320]   Sorry, I'm not laughing because it's funny.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.840]   I'm laughing because it's just pretty much everywhere.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.920]   Latex paint, coatings, medical devices, automotive parts,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.200]   tires on the road, degrading,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.660]   giving off little microplastics into the air,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.860]   microplastics raining down from the sky, literally.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.260]   Pipe film containers, laminated safety glass,
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.040]   car windshields, oh, great, even the car windshield.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.540]   Drinking bottles, textile fibers, resins, paints,
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.220]   varnish, construction, automotive parts.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.140]   Okay, so basically everywhere, right?
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.640]   These things are everywhere.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.300]   So what are we to do?
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.860]   Well, what we are to do is to limit
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.700]   the long-term accumulation of microplastics
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.680]   and nanoplastics in our system.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.000]   There are ways that we can limit
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   their introduction to our system,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.340]   but as long as you're breathing,
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.920]   as long as you're walking around,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.680]   as long as you're near a road,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.400]   you are exposed to microplastics.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.960]   So until there's a huge movement to make better tires
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.800]   that don't degrade as quickly,
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.240]   or to create filters in our home environments
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.760]   that remove the microplastics,
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.440]   which frankly, I think both of those things
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.920]   are not reasonable expectations,
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.720]   at least not in this lifetime.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.660]   Well, until then, what you can do is you can try
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.140]   and limit their entry and accumulation into your body.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.580]   So rather than list off all the ways that you can limit
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.940]   so-called bioaccumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.820]   at the beginning or at the end of today's episode,
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.540]   I'm going to intersperse them at times that are relevant
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.140]   to what I just discussed about how microplastics
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.820]   get into our system and the tissues they are lodged in.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.260]   So I'll tell you right now that a few ways
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.640]   that you can really do yourself a service
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.660]   in limiting your exposure to microplastics
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.100]   is to limit your consumption of water from plastic bottles.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.820]   Okay, that might seem kind of obvious,
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.540]   but check out these data.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.680]   This is pretty wild.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.140]   There was an analysis of the number of microplastic
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.060]   and nanoplastic particles in bottled water.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.940]   And it was estimated that there were about 30,000
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.580]   of these particles per liter of water.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.180]   Okay, and those data stood for quite a long time.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.700]   Then imaging techniques for measuring the number
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.780]   of these different particles,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.740]   in particular the really small nanoparticles,
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.700]   the ones that are less than one micron in diameter,
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.660]   the imaging tools for those improved.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.740]   Okay, and I'll explain a little bit about that in a moment.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.540]   And there was a paper published in the Proceedings
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.140]   of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.940]   that showed that the amount of nanoplastic in particular,
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.100]   but microplastic and nanoplastics that are present
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:30.060]   in bottled water was actually vastly underestimated
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.980]   in that previous study.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.460]   Rather than 30,000 particles per liter,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.660]   the reanalysis with better methods showed
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.740]   that it was anywhere from 110 all the way
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.380]   up to 400,000 particles per liter.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.660]   And the average was 240,000 particles per liter.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.380]   So that means that the amount of microplastics
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.340]   and nanoplastics in bottled water is actually much,
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.980]   much higher than we initially thought.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.220]   And a very simple way to limit your exposure
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.540]   to microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.580]   is to avoid drinking water from plastic bottles,
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.460]   in particular plastic bottles that have been heated up.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.300]   Now you might say, well,
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.220]   I don't heat up my plastic water bottles.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.420]   Right, but you don't know what happened
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.580]   to those plastic water bottles
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.140]   en route to the store you bought them at
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.300]   or en route to your refrigerator, right?
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.040]   They could have sat in the back of a hot truck.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.500]   They could have sat in the back of a loading dock,
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.860]   any number of different things.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.580]   Now, this is not to say that if you drink
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.620]   the occasional water out of a plastic bottle
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.980]   that you're going to harm your health.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.100]   I'm absolutely not saying that.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.540]   However, it's pretty clear that there's a lot
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.080]   of microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.620]   that are completely avoidable,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.100]   at least avoidable in terms of your ingestion of them
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.780]   in plastic water bottles.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.820]   So it makes sense to me why you would want to avoid those.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.940]   Also as a consumable, that's not very reusable.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.740]   I suppose you could reuse those plastic bottles,
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.740]   but most people don't,
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.040]   at least they don't use them for very long.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.940]   They get pretty flimsy pretty quickly.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.540]   You're much better off having either a stainless steel
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.380]   bottle or some sort of ceramic mug or using glass
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.280]   or using some other vessel for water that is reusable.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.860]   And of course that is not made of plastic.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.660]   And then of course the question arises,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.500]   how much microplastic and nanoplastic is in tap water?
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.680]   And it turns out there's quite a lot of it.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.820]   Now it varies according to location,
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.780]   but there are ways that you can get those microplastics
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.940]   and nanoplastics out of your tap water.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.000]   The best way turns out to be a little bit expensive,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.380]   admittedly, and that's to use a reverse osmosis filter.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.460]   So reverse osmosis filters will get rid
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.500]   of all the microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.780]   Of course, it will also remove some key minerals
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.820]   from the water.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.340]   So you'll have to remineralize that water.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.660]   If one looks at the price
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.900]   of reverse osmosis filtration systems, they're not cheap.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.860]   They can range anywhere from 300 to 500 or even $600
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.940]   for a home unit.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.720]   And many of those units will remineralize the water.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.060]   So basically it takes the water,
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.340]   cleans out the microplastics, nanoplastics,
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.520]   and a bunch of other bad stuff that you don't want.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.160]   And then it's going to remineralize the water
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.620]   so that you're getting enough minerals in your water.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.560]   Now, if you look at the cost of a reverse osmosis filter,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.340]   I, like you, kind of go a little wide-eyed,
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.300]   like, oh, that's a lot of money for water.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.920]   But if one thinks about the total amount of money one spends
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.060]   in a given year on plastic bottled water that we consume
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.820]   and then, you know, throw away essentially the bottles,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.920]   or even bottled water from glass bottles,
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.700]   I've gotten in the habit of trying to drink water
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.540]   from glass bottles.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.820]   And when you go out and you buy those,
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.520]   you feel better that you're not consuming a lot
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.400]   of microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.040]   but they are very expensive.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.940]   So the costs probably line up pretty well.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.300]   And when I did that analysis, I realized,
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.820]   well, actually the home reverse osmosis filter
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.600]   with remineralization actually will save on costs,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.560]   provided that one is good about filling glass bottles
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.540]   or stainless steel bottles with that water
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.000]   and making sure to, you know, when you leave the house
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.440]   to take those bottles with you.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.280]   Again, I don't think it's possible for everyone
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.480]   to avoid all consumption of water from plastic bottles.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.500]   That's just not reasonable to expect, right?
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.400]   You don't want to be that person
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.200]   that's carrying around water everywhere you go
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.980]   to friends' houses at dinner, et cetera.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.200]   I don't think we need to be that concerned
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.820]   about the amount of microplastic and nanoplastic
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.040]   in water sources.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.940]   And certainly you wouldn't want to avoid drinking water
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.680]   from plastic bottles to the point where you dehydrate
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.200]   yourself or put yourself at risk.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.560]   I'm not trying to create that kind of concern here.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.180]   What I'm trying to say is if you are concerned
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.700]   about microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.340]   and you really want to limit your exposure,
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.720]   one of the best ways to do that is to limit your consumption
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.740]   of water from plastic bottles.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.520]   And because microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.060]   are present in tap water, you're going to need some way
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.140]   to remove those microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.680]   from your tap water if you're very concerned about them.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.620]   I'm not here to say everyone should do this.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.980]   I'm certainly not saying that.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.740]   I'm saying that if you are concerned
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.740]   about microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.100]   and we'll talk about some of the reasons
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.220]   one might want to be concerned about them,
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.100]   well, then installing a reverse osmosis filtration system
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.040]   on your home water might be a good idea.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.460]   And it's likely to save you costs if you look at it
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.440]   in comparison to buying disposable bottles of water.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.800]   Now, there are a lot of other ways besides drinking water
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.820]   from plastic bottles that microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.160]   make their way into our system.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.640]   And I can list off many of them,
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.120]   but I'm trying to create a hierarchy here of the things
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.220]   that are potentially the major sources
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.640]   and the ones that we can most easily avoid
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.380]   and that are likely to save us costs overall.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.380]   So one thing that's very clear is that there's a lot
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.600]   of microplastics and nanoplastics in sea salt.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.440]   Who would have thought?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.820]   But then you think about it and it's like,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.380]   well, this stuff is getting out into the ocean.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.980]   There's a lot of plastic in the ocean.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.440]   It's a super depressing scene when one sees the pictures
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.460]   of all the plastic floating out there.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.780]   In fact, there's a book that I read in preparation
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.980]   for this episode.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.700]   Gosh, it was so depressing, but important for me to read.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.780]   Maybe you want to read it as well.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.220]   It's quite good, although it will be a bit of a downer.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.580]   The title of the book is "A Poison Like No Other,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.700]   How Microplastics Corrupted Our Planet
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.460]   and Our Bodies" by Matt Simon.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.700]   And I listened to this book and gosh,
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.980]   it really convinces you that there's microplastics
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.540]   everywhere, both on land, in the air,
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.580]   and in the ocean, unfortunately.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.740]   And of course, sea salt comes from the ocean.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.620]   So a simple solution to this is if you're going to use salt,
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.140]   and I'm a big fan of salt, not overdoing it,
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.420]   but salt has its role, right?
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.820]   It's a wonderful substance, both for sake of taste
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.380]   and for sake of health.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.340]   I did an episode about salt.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.220]   Again, don't over consume salt.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.540]   Don't blast your blood pressure.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.480]   Don't blow a gasket.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.260]   But many people would do well to have a little bit more salt,
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.020]   especially if you're eating a really clean diet,
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.060]   especially if you're hydrating very well.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.340]   Focus on something like pink Himalayan salt
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.140]   or salt that comes from a non-marine source, okay?
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.900]   It's very simple to do.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.340]   It's some of the best salt out there.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.460]   It's not terribly expensive,
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.540]   and you would do well to avoid sea salt
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.700]   and get your salt from those other sources.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.780]   In doing so, you're going to lower your exposure
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.440]   to microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.060]   There's some pretty scary pictures of sea salt
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.340]   under the microscope and all the little bits of plastic
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.160]   that are in there.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.540]   And you only have to see those pictures once
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.700]   or just hear it from me to make the shift
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.300]   to Himalayan sea salt.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.740]   And the pink salt is pretty.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.560]   It looks nice.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.400]   It tastes great.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.660]   So that's an easy, very low-cost shift that you can make.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.900]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.540]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.100]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.220]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.660]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.740]   all of your foundational nutritional needs,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.900]   and it tastes great.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.620]   Now, I've been drinking AG1 since 2012,
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.060]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.580]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.420]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.740]   to purchase one supplement.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.780]   And I'm so glad that I made that supplement, AG1.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.900]   The reason for that is even though I strive
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.900]   to eat most of my foods from whole foods
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.700]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.420]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits, vegetables,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.340]   vitamins, and minerals, micronutrients,
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.580]   and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.500]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.300]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.740]   I sleep well at night, and keep my immune system strong.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.240]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.900]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.460]   my physical health, my mental health, and my performance,
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.660]   both cognitive and physical, are better.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.500]   I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1,
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.340]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.380]   I also notice, and this makes perfect sense
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.460]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.980]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.380]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.540]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.700]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.140]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.260]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.620]   to claim a special offer.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.860]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.420]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.900]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.660]   to claim that special offer.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.820]   Okay, so we've talked about bottled water sources
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.780]   and filtering your water.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.180]   We talked about sea salt.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.260]   Another major source of these microplastics
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.620]   that was very surprising to me
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.600]   is from the lining of canned soup.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.380]   I don't think I'm ever gonna eat canned soup again
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.660]   unless I absolutely need to.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.160]   Sorry, canned soup companies.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.440]   But there was a study, the study was entitled
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.860]   canned soup consumption and urinary bisphenol A,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.380]   a randomized crossover trial.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.380]   I'll describe a little bit more
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.540]   about what bisphenol A is a little bit later,
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.700]   but bisphenol A is a known endocrine disruptor.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.780]   It mimics estrogen in ways that can activate
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.380]   or block estrogenic pathways.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.620]   So it messes up hormone pathways
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.580]   either by activating them or blocking them.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.040]   It can also bind to androgen receptors potentially
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.420]   and cause some issues there.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.240]   Bisphenol A or BPA is not a good thing.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   Turns out there's lots of it in the lining of soup cans.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.380]   The reason is soup tends to be a little bit fatty.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.660]   So even if you get the nonfat soup,
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.300]   it tends to have some lipid in there
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.940]   and it also has some acidity to it.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.580]   And the lining helps maintain the flavor
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.940]   and the freshness of the soup in those cans.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.800]   In this study, what they did is they gave people
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.940]   either fresh soup or canned soup for five days.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.820]   Then they did a so-called two-day washout
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.300]   where they took a break from soup
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.460]   and then they reversed the conditions.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.780]   I'll cut to the chase here
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.100]   because the conclusion of this study is wild.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.060]   What they found was that consumption
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.240]   of one serving of canned soup daily
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.180]   over the course of five days,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.380]   here I'm quoting by the way,
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.900]   was associated with more than 1000% increase
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.820]   in urinary BPA and bisphenol A.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.660]   Now that's urinary BPA, so people are excreting it.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.500]   I want to emphasize that.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.540]   But a thousand fold increase in BPA from canned soup.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.020]   I don't know, I'm not alarmist,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.580]   but I only have to read this once.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.060]   Think about my love of canned soup.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.500]   Not that great, done.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.980]   I'm not eating canned soup again
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.460]   unless I'm absolutely starving
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.620]   and I need some soup very, very badly.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.580]   My suggestion would be unless you have a powerful reason
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.980]   to consume canned soup, don't consume canned soup.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.860]   The one caveat being that if you can find canned soup
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.040]   that does not have any BPA,
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.220]   that is it says no BPAs on the container,
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.420]   well then go at it, have as much canned soup as you want.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.380]   But I should be very clear
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.460]   that a lot of canned products now say no BPA,
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.420]   but they contain other endocrine disruptors
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.080]   and the amount of microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.060]   in those soups is still unknown.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.620]   So part of my hidden motivation of this episode
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.160]   and perhaps the motivation of other podcasters
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.000]   in the health space
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.460]   that are talking about microplastics now,
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.980]   and by the way, Dr. Rhonda Patrick
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.900]   did a really wonderful podcast
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.120]   about microplastics just recently.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.000]   We didn't coordinate,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.460]   that's why we both ended up doing it
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.360]   roughly at the same time.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.820]   We talked about it afterwards and chuckled about that.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.240]   I guess we're both interested
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.140]   in some of the same themes, of course.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.220]   One of the perhaps hidden agendas
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.900]   is that some of these food manufacturing companies
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.300]   and beverage manufacturing companies
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.580]   will start to include more thorough descriptions
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.300]   on their labeling of what is and is not contained
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.340]   in the various products such as canned soup
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.660]   and water, et cetera.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.340]   Not just no BPAs,
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.860]   but hopefully some of the other things
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.980]   that are problematic that we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.220]   such as BPS, which is another endocrine disruptor.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.580]   So if you see no BPAs,
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.620]   sometimes there's still BPS in there, okay?
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.180]   We'll talk about BPS as well as phthalates,
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.220]   which are something that make plastic
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.820]   and other containers more durable and more flexible.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.420]   And phthalates have been discussed by people
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.820]   like Dr. Shana Swan,
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.740]   who will soon be a guest on this podcast
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.820]   and has shown up on other podcasts,
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.300]   talking about how phthalates
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.620]   are known endocrine disruptors in development
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.060]   and likely in adulthood as well.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:34.140]   So I guess my push for you to never consume canned soup
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.340]   again might be a little bit harsh.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.760]   That's just my decision.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   Here's what I'll do.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.940]   I'll make a bargain with the canned soup companies.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.920]   If you all start putting a more thorough description
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.820]   about what is and is not contained in those soup cans,
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.140]   all right, not just no BPA,
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.200]   but is there truly also no BPS?
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.900]   Are there no phthalates, et cetera?
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.580]   Then maybe I'll make the move back to canned soup.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.540]   And of course, most of you have probably heard
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.060]   that you're not supposed to microwave plastic containers.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.360]   Now, you'll see microwave safe
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.660]   on a number of different containers.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.500]   That just means that it's not going to melt
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.380]   in the microwave.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.080]   It does not mean that you aren't being exposed
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.340]   to microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.700]   and BPAs, BPS, phthalates, et cetera.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.740]   So in general, it's a good idea
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.460]   to avoid putting any kind of plastic into the microwave,
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.580]   at least if you're going to microwave food
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.060]   and then consume that food.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.460]   The other surprising, at least to me,
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.780]   source of BPAs and BPSs,
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.860]   so these endocrine disruptors and microplastics
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   and nanoplastics, that's very robust, is paper cups.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.800]   Goodness gracious.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.860]   I would have thought paper cups are safe,
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.340]   but you know those paper cups that you put hot liquids into
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.620]   and they often have a plastic lid?
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.840]   Well, even if they don't have a plastic lid on them,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.640]   the lining of the paper cup,
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.840]   which makes those cups durable
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.440]   when you put hot liquids in there,
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.280]   like hot coffee or hot tea,
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.040]   well, that contains typically,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.320]   unless it says no BPA and no BPS,
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.480]   it contains lots of BPA and BPSs,
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.160]   microplastics, nanoplastics.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.040]   And so putting hot liquids in there,
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.000]   actually there was an analysis that showed
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.220]   that if liquid that's heated up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.220]   is put in those containers, it starts to leach out.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.440]   It starts to pull those microplastics, nanoplastics,
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.360]   BPAs and BPS from the cup linings.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.000]   So the other day I went across the street
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.840]   and bought a cup of coffee.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.600]   Of course, they sold it to me in a paper cup.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.440]   And I thought, oh goodness,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.640]   I forgot to bring my mug and my travel mug,
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.260]   my stainless steel mug or my ceramic mug.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.520]   Did I not purchase the coffee?
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.040]   No, I'd already ordered the coffee.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.880]   I didn't walk back.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.160]   What I did is as soon as I got back,
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.280]   I took the coffee and I poured it into a ceramic mug.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.580]   So I'm not extremist.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.520]   I'm not somebody who's going
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.720]   to completely avoid these things.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.840]   But in the future,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.800]   I'll try and remember to bring my mug over.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.760]   Some places even give you a little discount on your coffee.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.860]   So again, these are cost-saving approaches.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.840]   You're certainly limiting or reducing the amount of waste
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.920]   that you're creating in the world.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.880]   So that can only be a good thing, okay?
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   And the plastic lids,
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.720]   probably a good idea to avoid drinking
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.200]   through those plastic lids too often.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.400]   Again, I want to emphasize,
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.080]   I'm not one of these people that's going to freak out
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.680]   about drinking a hot liquid through a plastic lid.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.940]   These microplastics and nanoplastics are everywhere.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.360]   We're consuming them all the time.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.160]   We can remove them from our body.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.680]   And later we'll talk about ways that you can accelerate
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.160]   or increase the amount of removal of them from your body.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.720]   But if we're just a little bit more conscious
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.160]   about how they get into our body,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.480]   and we're a little bit more conscious
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.800]   about the elevated costs and the elevated amount of trash
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.120]   that's going to recycle into landfill and so on,
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   probably a good idea to just bring your mug with you,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   your travel mug with you,
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.640]   try and make those mugs and travel mugs ceramic,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.800]   stainless steel, or some other vessel
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.560]   that doesn't contain BPAs or BPSs.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.880]   Before we move on to talk about what happens
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.860]   when microplastics and nanoplastics make it into say,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.120]   the testicle or the brain,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.580]   like what the consequences of that is and are,
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.240]   I want to just briefly return to something
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.640]   that I flew past a while ago.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.480]   And that's the analysis of microplastics
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.920]   and nanoplastic particles that are in bottled water.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.400]   Remember, initially it was thought to be
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.280]   30,000 particles per liter.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   Then later it was discovered using better techniques
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.840]   that it's actually more like 240,000
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   on average particles per liter.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.560]   How did that huge discrepancy in data arise?
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.520]   Now, I realize this is not a data analysis discussion,
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.160]   but I want to talk about this just briefly
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.720]   because it illustrates for you
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.520]   something really important about science,
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.680]   which is as tools for measurement get better,
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.120]   so does our understanding about what's going on
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.000]   in our brains and bodies.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.900]   And it's a very simple and kind of cool thing
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.440]   related to light.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.100]   So you could imagine that the first paper
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.380]   was looking under the microscope at a drop of water
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.680]   taken from a bottle that was plastic
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.920]   and then imaged the number
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.480]   of little plastic particles in there.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.320]   You'd say, well, there's a particle
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.920]   and there's a particle and there's a particle
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.760]   and there are tools that can count those particles.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.080]   Well, what if you have two particles
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.040]   that are really close together, right?
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.200]   If you recall microplastics are anywhere
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.940]   from one micron in diameter,
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.440]   all the way up to five millimeters in diameter,
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.920]   but nanoplastics are less than one micron in diameter.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.560]   So how do you know that when you see a clump of stuff
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.040]   under the microscope in that drop of water
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.960]   that you're looking at one big piece of plastic
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.320]   versus thousands and thousands of little pieces
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.280]   of nanoplastic or even just much smaller pieces
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.720]   of microplastic?
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.000]   Well, it has to do with what's called
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.980]   the point spread function.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.800]   And I don't really want to get into this in too much detail,
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.640]   but basically when you shine light on something,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.180]   you get kind of a little hill of light, if you will,
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.840]   there's a peak at the center
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.240]   and then it had drops off with distance.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   The reason why the numbers jumped from 30,000 to 240,000
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.680]   is not because the researchers got much better,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.040]   it's because the tools got much better, okay?
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.840]   There are new imaging techniques
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.560]   and I'll put a reference to this for those of you
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.400]   that are into this kind of stuff,
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.920]   entitled rapid single particle chemical imaging
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.240]   of nanoplastics by SRS microscopy.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.520]   Okay, pretty nerdy stuff,
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.360]   but it's fun if you're interested in light
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.720]   and how light can illuminate things
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.920]   and show detail or not detail.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.000]   But basically what we're realizing
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.200]   is that there are a lot more particles of plastic
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.280]   in different tissues,
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.320]   in different things that we're ingesting, et cetera,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.720]   because we're getting better and better ways
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.560]   of separating those clumps of light
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.080]   into lots of little clumps of light
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.120]   and realizing, oh, that looked like one particle, right?
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.360]   Remember it's particles per liter.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.880]   It's not one particle, it's 10,000 particles.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.080]   Now you might say, okay, well,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.520]   what's the difference between a bunch of little particles
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.680]   and one big particle?
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.400]   Ah, there's a big difference.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.680]   What's the big difference?
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.920]   Little particles can make it across barriers
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.900]   that big particles can't.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.400]   These little nanoparticles of plastic
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.480]   are especially concerning because those are the ones
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.060]   that you find in greatest abundance,
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.920]   or I should say among the plastics
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.560]   that you find in different tissues,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.660]   the ones that are in greatest abundance in the brain,
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.320]   the testes and the follicle, again,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.600]   these tissues that nature and evolution
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.820]   have gone out of their way to protect
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.340]   with these very stringent barriers,
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.320]   like the blood-brain barrier,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.780]   like the blood-testicular barrier,
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.720]   like the blood-follicle barrier.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.160]   Those are the ones that are getting across
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.400]   because they're very, very small.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.220]   They can sneak through the little holes
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.960]   in those biological fences.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.800]   They're getting deposited in those tissues,
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.440]   brain, testicle, and follicle,
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.880]   and they're staying there at least until people die,
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.680]   which in the case of the analysis of post-mortem tissue
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.880]   is many, many decades later.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.840]   Okay, so I'm not just raising this discussion
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.200]   about ways to disambiguate large particles
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.080]   from small particles just to be nerdy and technical.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.480]   It turns out to be a really important issue
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.160]   with real biological implications.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.640]   Okay, so lots of itty-bitty little pieces of plastic
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.560]   getting their way into tissues like brain,
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.280]   follicle, testes, liver, lung, et cetera.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.940]   What are some of the implications of this?
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.280]   Now, there are a lot of animal data,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.440]   data in fish, data in mice, et cetera,
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.380]   that have explored how microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.940]   can disrupt any number of different biological functions,
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.460]   but it's probably worth looking at
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.600]   how nanoplastic and microplastic accumulation
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.560]   in specific tissues is correlated
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.880]   with specific health detriments in humans,
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.960]   even though the data are correlative, right?
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.560]   It's much harder to get causal data from human studies
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.600]   because the animal studies, frankly,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.120]   are hard to translate to humans,
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.360]   in this case in particular,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.520]   because a lot of the features of animal biology,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.800]   while similar to human biology,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.640]   humans are animals, but you get the point,
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.440]   they don't correspond so easily
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.680]   when looking at microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.580]   for the following reason.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.180]   Let's say you have a little fish,
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.260]   that fish is a couple centimeters long,
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.360]   and it turns out there's, I don't know,
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.240]   about an aspirin's size of microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.860]   in that fish when that fish is analyzed post-mortem.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.940]   You'd say, okay, well, that's kind of a lot, right?
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.500]   An aspirin's worth in a, or an aspirin size
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.260]   batch of microplastics and nanoplastics in that little fish,
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.180]   and then you look in humans and you realize, okay,
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.020]   well, there's more microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.580]   but not that much more.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.780]   How much of a detriment is there really going to be?
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.280]   Can you look at the study in the fish,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.140]   seeing, for instance, and this has been demonstrated
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.300]   that you have disruption in neurological pathways,
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.640]   the formation of those pathways,
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.280]   like brain development is altered,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.860]   reproductive function is altered, et cetera.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.140]   It's hard to translate.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.620]   We don't really know what it means in terms of humans.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.900]   So we'll turn to the correlative data in humans,
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.420]   and I'll look to the strongest data,
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.220]   at least that I could find out there,
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.360]   and there are kind of three major cases
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.500]   that I think are worth highlighting.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.480]   The first one is that there was a study done in humans.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.780]   This was published in 2021.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.800]   It was published in the Journal of Environmental Science
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.740]   and Technology that found much higher levels
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.260]   of microplastics in the stool samples of people
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.740]   that were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.360]   Okay, irritable bowel syndrome is very disruptive
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.940]   to people's wellbeing.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.860]   There isn't an obvious cure for irritable bowel syndrome,
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.980]   although some people find relief
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.700]   by improving their gut microbiota,
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.660]   by limiting body-wide and gut inflammation
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.700]   through any number of different things,
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.660]   improving sleep and eating a low inflammation diet, et cetera.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:55.820]   This is something that I'll probably cover
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.420]   in a future episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.300]   gastrointestinal challenges, that is.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.980]   So I want to be very clear,
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.200]   there was no direct causation established,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.020]   but it was clear that there were higher levels
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   of microplastics found in the stool tissue
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.940]   coming from people who had irritable bowel syndrome
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.740]   than in individuals who did not
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.100]   have irritable bowel syndrome.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.180]   And while no study is perfect,
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.340]   they included a number of important controls
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.460]   in the experiment to control for age range
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.660]   and some other features.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.300]   So it's reasonable to assume
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.660]   that the accumulation of microplastics in the gut
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.820]   or somewhere along the GI tract had somehow led to
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.460]   or related to irritable bowel syndrome.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.040]   Okay, now you could also imagine the reverse.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.340]   This is very important to understand.
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.620]   You could also imagine that people
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.460]   who had irritable bowel syndrome
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.980]   perhaps are less good at filtering microplastics
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.420]   and nanoplastics from the food and liquids they consume
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.360]   than are people who don't have irritable bowel syndrome.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.300]   So the causality, if it exists at all,
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.620]   could run in either direction or both.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.580]   Nonetheless, I think it's an interesting study.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.900]   And if you're somebody who suffers
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.540]   from gastrointestinal distress,
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.140]   such as irritable bowel syndrome or otherwise,
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.440]   I think you'd be wise, indeed all people would be wise,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.820]   but I think you'd be especially wise
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.060]   to take into consideration some of the to-dos
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.620]   and not to-dos that I'm covering during today's episode,
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.460]   such as avoiding consuming water from plastic bottles,
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.720]   some of the stuff we talked about earlier,
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.740]   avoiding canned soup and other BPA, BPS-containing containers
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.780]   and things of that sort,
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.180]   or things that come from those containers.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.620]   The other area where there was
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.260]   some really interesting correlative data
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.440]   relates to reproductive function and hormone health.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.940]   And this is where we can start to get into
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.540]   a bit more detail about BPAs and BPSs and phthalates
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.040]   and some of their roles in disrupting endocrine,
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.900]   that is hormone pathways.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.540]   So there's a study I'll put a link to
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.420]   in the show note captions that's entitled
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.060]   "Urinary Phthalate Metabolites
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.980]   are Associated with Decreased Serum Testosterone,"
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.180]   so that's in blood, "in Men, Women, and Children."
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.580]   Okay, this is an interesting study for a number of reasons.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.180]   First of all, it emphasizes
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.300]   something that everybody should know,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   which is that testosterone plays key roles
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.100]   in men, women, and kids, okay?
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.660]   It is not the case that testosterone
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.020]   is just present in men and boys,
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.200]   it's also present in women and girls,
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.180]   and it plays an important role in everybody, okay?
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.180]   It's involved, of course,
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.820]   in some of the things that we normally associate
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.940]   with testosterone, such as muscle mass,
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.920]   bone density, strength, et cetera,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.900]   but testosterone can be converted to estrogen,
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.580]   testosterone is involved in libido in both men and women,
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.140]   it's involved in brain development in boys and girls,
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.340]   in genitalia development, and on and on.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.240]   So it's an important hormone,
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.660]   and it was clear from this study
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.700]   that elevated levels of phthalates,
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.020]   that is phthalate metabolites,
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.100]   are associated with lower testosterone levels
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.980]   in all those populations.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.940]   They point out, quote,
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.580]   that the strongest and most consistent inverse relationships
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.440]   between level of phthalates and testosterone,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.460]   that is elevated phthalate metabolites, lower testosterone,
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.620]   were found among women ages 40 to 60 years.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.460]   And this is very important,
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.260]   if you saw the episode that we did
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.860]   with Dr. Mary-Claire Haver on perimenopause-menopause,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.460]   she emphasized that perimenopause-menopause,
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.460]   which typically sets in somewhere
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.380]   between one's late 40s and 60s,
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.900]   okay, there's huge variation there,
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.820]   sometimes as early as one's 30s,
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.460]   that would be early, however,
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.840]   more often in one's 40s and 50s,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.540]   sometimes as late as 60s,
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.820]   involves reductions in estrogen, but also in testosterone.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.740]   And this has major implications
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.700]   for creating less feelings of vigor,
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.980]   lowered libido, less recovery from exercise,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.540]   and other life stressors and things of that sort.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.920]   Now, the study also interestingly shows that in,
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.020]   quote, adult men,
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.700]   the only significant or suggestive inverse association
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.340]   between phthalate metabolites and testosterone
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.400]   were observed among men 40 to 60 years old.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.460]   Now, there are a number of different ways
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.620]   that we can interpret those data.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.500]   One is that men younger than 40
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.940]   have high enough levels of testosterone that,
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.860]   or the ranges of testosterone are great enough
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.500]   in that sample of younger than 40 years old,
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.380]   that somehow that was able to swamp out
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.140]   any reductions in testosterone
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.540]   that were caused by phthalate metabolites,
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.940]   or rather that once men get from 40 to 60 years old,
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.500]   that there's somehow a vulnerability
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.100]   of the testosterone pathways to phthalates,
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.740]   or, and none of these are mutually exclusive, of course,
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.380]   that the phthalates had built up
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.980]   in those men's system over a number of years,
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.220]   and then were having their major effects
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.460]   on those men between 40 and 60 years old.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.300]   I do find it interesting that the major effects
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.380]   were observed in both men and women, 40 to 60 years old.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.700]   And the interpretation of those data
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.500]   that makes the most sense to me, at least,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.160]   is that there's a cumulative effect
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.940]   of these phthalates over time
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.460]   that reveals itself at least statistically
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.820]   in men and women once they reach 40 to 60 years.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.840]   So what are these phthalates?
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.060]   Well, these phthalates are things
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.780]   that are included in plastics that house liquids
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.260]   and foods that we eat, or that we cook with,
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.100]   or that simply exist in our environment
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.020]   and are getting broken down, and that we're inhaling,
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.220]   and then are making their way
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.020]   across the blood testes barrier, blood follicle barrier,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.180]   or into any number of other tissues.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.700]   Those phthalates are there, of course,
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.860]   to make plastic more flexible and durable,
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.340]   but they are known endocrine disruptors.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.180]   Dr. Shana Swan has done beautiful work
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.100]   showing that young animals and potentially humans
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.980]   who are exposed to phthalates
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.660]   from things like pesticides in particular
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.020]   can actually have a fairly major disruption
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.260]   in what's called the anogenital distance, okay?
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.420]   Withhold your chuckles.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.180]   The distance between the penis and the anus
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.220]   in people that have been exposed to phthalates
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.320]   or mothers of boys that have been exposed to phthalates,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.700]   those boys are born with a shorter penile to anal distance,
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.820]   okay, typically it's of a certain distance,
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.180]   and there's a correlation with reduced anogenital distance
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.780]   that is a external marker, okay?
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.840]   It's not that that itself is necessarily a bad thing.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.040]   That's not what we're saying here,
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.100]   but that's an external marker that can be measured in mice,
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.820]   and there are some studies
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.700]   that are exploring that in humans as well,
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.400]   that correlates with a number of other things,
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.980]   including lower sperm counts, reduced sperm motility,
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.880]   and things of that sort.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.220]   Likewise, BPAs, the bisphenol A and BPS
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.820]   are known endocrine disruptors.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.100]   I talked about this a little bit earlier.
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.020]   They're known to bind to estrogen receptors,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.700]   so they mimic estrogen.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.880]   Sometimes they activate
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.220]   those estrogen receptor-dependent pathways,
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.120]   so they literally mimic estrogen.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.520]   Sometimes they block those estrogen receptors
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.160]   so that estrogen cannot have the normal role
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.660]   of docking in those receptors
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.020]   and causing their normal functions,
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.320]   and BPA, and to some extent BPS,
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.900]   and potentially phthalates,
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.460]   can dock to androgen receptors as well,
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.460]   sometimes referred to as testosterone receptors,
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.700]   androgen receptors.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.440]   So the point is that BPAs, BPSs, and phthalates
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.540]   are not good for endocrine function,
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.240]   and they are present in basically all plastics,
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.580]   unless it says no BPA or all phthalates removed,
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.540]   they're present in herbicides, et cetera,
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.020]   and they're of real concern.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.520]   And it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.740]   that you can detect microplastics in human testes,
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.100]   and I didn't mention this earlier,
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.060]   and in semen, and it is now very clear
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.640]   that that's correlated with reduced sperm counts
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.100]   and lower sperm motility.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.740]   Now, I also want to be very clear.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.360]   Remember, I'm not an alarmist.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.280]   I want to be clear that just because sperm counts
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.080]   are significantly lower in people
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.020]   to have a certain amount of microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.420]   potentially in their testes,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.520]   or that they've been exposed to,
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.080]   does not necessarily mean that they're infertile.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.920]   It is true that total sperm count and sperm motility,
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.640]   forward motility being an important indicator
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.480]   of sperm health,
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.600]   are correlated with one's ability to fertilize an egg, okay?
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.640]   This was covered in a quite long,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.680]   but quite detailed episode that I did
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.820]   about fertility in both males and females.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.880]   There are a number of things one can do
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.040]   to increase sperm counts
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.000]   or to at least limit sperm count depletion.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.280]   There are a number of things that one can do
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.240]   to improve sperm motility.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.600]   I encourage you to check out that episode.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.240]   I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.280]   In fact, I'll link to the specific timestamp
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.120]   in the show note captions
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.400]   that gets to those particular strategies.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.280]   But the point here is that microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.520]   are found in human testes,
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.680]   and that's correlated with reductions in sperm count
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.160]   and reductions in sperm motility.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.520]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.240]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.880]   I recently became a Function member
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.160]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   to lab testing.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.080]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.060]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.700]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.580]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.360]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.640]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:44.040]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.800]   Function not only provides testing
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.240]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.900]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.760]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.320]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.160]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.280]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.600]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.400]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.260]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.740]   but offered medical doctor informed insights
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.440]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.740]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.500]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.860]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.780]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.820]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.580]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.140]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.560]   is so important for health.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.340]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.280]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.760]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.660]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.180]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.900]   as well as how comprehensive
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.260]   and how actionable the tests are,
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.500]   that I recently joined their advisory board
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.740]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.060]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.340]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:55.940]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.540]   but they're offering early access
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.780]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:02.060]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.220]   to get early access to Function.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.940]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.520]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.220]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.260]   Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.380]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.940]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.060]   That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.660]   physical health, and performance.
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.900]   And one of the best ways to ensure
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.220]   that you get a great night's sleep
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.720]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.460]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.260]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.780]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.280]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.220]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.820]   about one to three degrees.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.380]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.600]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.180]   by allowing you to control the temperature
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.300]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.440]   and end of the night.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.100]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.340]   for nearly four years now,
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.200]   and it has completely transformed
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.780]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.900]   Eight Sleep has now launched their newest generation
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.540]   of the pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.700]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.940]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.380]   and even has snoring detection
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.660]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.060]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.200]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.580]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.140]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.740]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.260]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.500]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.280]   Another study that got people's attention
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.920]   that I think is worth mentioning,
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.860]   which relates to microplastics, nanoplastics,
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.620]   and cardiovascular disease.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.540]   This was a study published
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.540]   in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2024.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.900]   So this is a fabulously good journal.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.780]   And what it found was that polyethylene,
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:46.300]   which is a component of many plastics out there,
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.660]   were detected in the carotid artery plaques of,
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.060]   in this case, 150 patients,
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.620]   which is approximately 58% of the ones
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.300]   that were included in the study.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.800]   And they also found using a technique
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.680]   called electron microscopy, today's fun,
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.040]   'cause we get to talk about different types of microscopy.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.120]   Electron microscopy allows you to look at things
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.780]   that are smaller than a micron.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.800]   You can look all the way down into the nanometer range,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.480]   right, you can start breaking up that 1/1000th
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   of a millimeter into nanometers,
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.440]   and you can start to see things
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.100]   that are really, really small.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.360]   And in this study, electron microscopy showed
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.540]   that there were these jagged edge foreign particles
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.900]   among the plaque macrophages
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.480]   of these cardiovascular plaques, okay?
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.920]   Macrophages are part of the immune system.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.600]   These are cells that go in and try and eat things up.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.800]   They're kind of like little ambulances.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.720]   Later, we're going to talk about microglia,
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.520]   which are the brain's resident microphages,
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.480]   or microfages, depending on where you live
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.760]   and how you like to pronounce it.
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.640]   But the point here is that when using a technique
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.000]   like electron microscopy that allows you
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.680]   to look at really, really small stuff,
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   it was very clear that the plaques that form these,
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.620]   you know, basically occlusions within the arteries,
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.060]   these are not good.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.380]   This is one of the reasons you want to eat properly
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.700]   and do cardiovascular exercise
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.220]   and take great care of yourself, et cetera.
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.060]   Electron microscopy made very clear
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:06.060]   that there were little plastic foreign jagged particles
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.620]   deposited in some of these plaques.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.560]   Now, were they the cause of these plaques?
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.700]   Did they contribute to some of the occlusion
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.020]   caused by those plaques?
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.700]   Unclear, but it's reasonable to assume
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.760]   that they form part of the physical substrate
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.900]   that could occlude blood flow through these arteries,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.620]   which of course leads to cardiovascular events,
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.580]   which of course are not good.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:28.460]   So I'll put a link to the study in the show note captions.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.660]   Again, these are correlative studies in humans.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.080]   Correlative studies are only that, they're just correlative,
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.880]   but I'm trying to provide a patchwork of things
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.280]   that suggest that it would indeed be a good idea
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.540]   to try and limit your ingestion
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.900]   or at least facilitate the removal of microplastics
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.940]   and nanoplastics from your system.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.680]   Another reason to do that relates
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.600]   to the so-called PFASs, okay?
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.520]   These are a group of chemicals sometimes referred to
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   as the quote unquote forever chemicals,
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.360]   because they are very longstanding
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.560]   once they get into your system.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.000]   These things have names other than PFAS,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.440]   which is an acronym, things like perfluoroalkyl,
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.960]   things like polyfluoroalkyl.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.140]   I don't know how good my pronunciation of those is,
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.040]   but if you look up the PFASs,
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.560]   you'll see that these things are known to cause liver damage.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.500]   They can damage the immune system.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.520]   They are considered forever chemicals
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.140]   because they are not broken down.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.300]   They last forever.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.740]   Then again, some of the other components of microplastics
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.620]   and nanoplastics are also known to last forever.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.300]   So you're starting to get a picture
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.620]   of these little tiny bits of plastic,
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.980]   some tinier than others,
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.220]   depositing themselves in our tissues.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.900]   They're everywhere out there.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.220]   They're most prominent in certain sources,
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.860]   but they're going to get into our system.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.160]   Now, does that mean that we can't get rid of them?
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.500]   No, we absolutely can get rid of them.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.060]   In fact, we have a number of different ways
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.180]   that we get rid of toxins and foreign invaders in our body.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.700]   Some of those include the immune system, right?
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.700]   Even if you have just some sort of foreign object,
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.300]   like a splinter, your immune system has a reaction to that.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.260]   Typically you get some pus around it, some inflammation,
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.020]   and that pus and inflammation is part of the process
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.700]   of isolating that foreign intruder, that splinter,
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.420]   and then eventually creating some tissues that extrude it
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.820]   or allow you to extrude it.
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.660]   You, of course, also have what's called
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:14.240]   your adaptive immune system,
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.760]   which doesn't just react to the presence of something foreign
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.000]   but creates antibodies, which can combat that,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.960]   and so on and so forth.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.640]   So your body has these, frankly, miraculous ways
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.760]   of dealing with foreign intruders of different sorts.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.760]   But it does seem that microplastics and nanoplastics
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.920]   can deposit themselves in their tissues and stay there.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.560]   Does that mean that you don't have any chance
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.720]   of getting them out?
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.920]   No, you have a liver.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.380]   Your liver, yes, contains microplastics and nanoplastics,
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.320]   very likely if you've been alive for any amount of time,
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.540]   but it also has what's called phase one
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:48.280]   and phase two detoxification processes
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:51.020]   that allow you to break down and get rid
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.120]   of certain foreign products,
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.400]   including microplastics and nanoplastics.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.720]   So let's talk about liver detoxification
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.680]   and some of the things that can facilitate
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.000]   liver detoxification that you actually have control over.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.200]   Okay, so let's talk about liver detoxification.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.800]   The liver is such a cool organ.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.260]   It does so many cool things.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.160]   It's not just about detoxification, by the way.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.140]   It does all sorts of things related to blood clotting.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.120]   It's just an amazing, amazing organ.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.680]   We should probably do an entire episode about the liver
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.640]   and not just eating liver.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.920]   I'm not a fan of eating liver.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.880]   I do it every once in a while
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.920]   because I'm told it's nutritious.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.420]   But let's talk about the living, functioning liver.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:33.960]   There are two types of liver detoxification processes, okay?
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.080]   So this is not about detoxing your liver.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.380]   You may hear about detoxing your liver.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.240]   That's a whole other discussion
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.960]   I don't want to get into, at least not here.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.280]   There's type one and type two liver detoxification, okay?
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.560]   There's type one, so-called phase one liver detoxification
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.600]   is also called the oxidation phase.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   It involves something called cytochrome P450 enzymes, okay?
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.760]   So enzymes are involved in the breakdown
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.200]   of different things.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.040]   It converts toxins into less harmful components
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.680]   that ideally are excreted from the body, okay?
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.560]   Type two or phase two liver detoxification.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.840]   Again, this is not detoxification of your liver.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.720]   This is detoxification by your liver.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.740]   Is also called the conjugation phase of detoxification.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.800]   It involves enzymes that attach molecules to toxins, okay?
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.260]   It makes those toxins water soluble
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:26.360]   and easier to excrete from the body in the form of urine,
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.480]   okay?
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.680]   It neutralizes reactive intermediates from phase one, okay?
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.480]   So phase one and phase two detoxification work together
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.640]   during phase two of liver control detoxification
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.880]   is where toxins are broken down
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.040]   and those broken down components are prepared
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.520]   to be removed from the body, okay?
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.280]   It is thought that the liver plays a primary role
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.480]   in the removal of microplastics and nanoplastics,
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.280]   BPAs and BPSs.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.400]   And by the way, I realized I didn't say this earlier
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.380]   and I should have.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:00.680]   These BPAs and BPSs are sometimes chemical components
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.720]   within the microplastics and nanoplastics.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.640]   They sometimes attach themselves
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.320]   to the microplastics and nanoplastics.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.400]   I should have said that earlier, forgive me.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.520]   The microplastics and nanoplastics can act
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.240]   as what are called vectors or carriers of things like BPAs,
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.600]   BPSs, phthalates and forever chemicals, okay?
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.080]   I should have mentioned that earlier.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.240]   So type two, that is phase two
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.840]   of liver control detoxification is where these toxins
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.440]   that are in the body and potentially
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.580]   these microplastics themselves and nanoplastics themselves
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.240]   are not necessarily broken down
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.720]   because some of those things can't be broken down,
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.280]   but where they are prepared to be excreted from the body.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.440]   And we have some degree of control
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.160]   over phase two of liver controlled detoxification.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.940]   Again, I'm calling it liver controlled detoxification
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.900]   so that this doesn't get misconstrued
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.840]   as detoxing your liver,
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.340]   which frankly is a very controversial topic
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.200]   and may not be possible at all.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.540]   Although simply by saying that,
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.600]   I'm probably going to get attacked,
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.720]   but here we're just talking about your liver's ability
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.720]   to break down and remove things from your body
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.880]   that you frankly don't want in your body.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.640]   One way that you can enhance phase two
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.040]   liver control detoxification processes
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.200]   is by increasing your intake
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.760]   of something called sulforaphane,
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.900]   which is present in cruciferous vegetables,
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.580]   such as broccoli and cauliflower.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.440]   Now, is there enough sulforaphane
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.480]   in cruciferous vegetables
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.100]   such that you could eat reasonable amounts,
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.140]   that you wouldn't have to overeat cruciferous vegetables
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.040]   in order to get this enhancement
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.920]   of phase two liver detoxification processes?
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.760]   Potentially, yes.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.040]   The animal studies that were carried out,
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.800]   so this would be in rodents like rats,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.240]   used supplemented sulforaphane
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.920]   at dosages that were comparable
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.940]   to the amounts of sulforaphane
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.120]   that a human might ingest
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.560]   from a large serving of broccoli
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.620]   or a large serving of cauliflower.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.800]   So this could be a few cups of raw broccoli
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.040]   or raw cauliflower.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.720]   Although frankly, if you're like me,
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.440]   that basically translates to gastrointestinal distress.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.840]   I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a party
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.200]   and there's some like, you know,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.560]   broccoli and cauliflower,
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.960]   maybe with some dip or something like that.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.120]   I usually avoid the dip 'cause I'm not really into dips,
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.000]   but we'll have a few pieces of broccoli
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.560]   and boy, does that disrupt my gut?
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.660]   I don't know about you.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.520]   And most things don't disrupt my gut.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.480]   That's not something that I struggle with.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.280]   I prefer to cook broccoli and to cook cauliflower.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.120]   If you cook broccoli and cauliflower lightly, okay?
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.640]   So you don't just, you know,
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.280]   turn into a complete mash.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.320]   You don't boil it such that a lot of the nutrients
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.280]   are leached out into the water around it.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.380]   So if you do sort of a light boil or a steam
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.220]   or something like that,
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.000]   or you pan cook it,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:32.920]   maybe in some olive oil,
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.360]   this is making me hungry by the way,
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.200]   you'll still maintain the sulforaphane
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.960]   in those cruciferous vegetables,
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960]   meaning it'll still be beneficial to you.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.800]   Now, some people, including me,
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.280]   don't tend to eat that many cruciferous vegetables.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.120]   I don't know why.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.880]   I just somehow don't make it a point
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.760]   to shop for them enough.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.600]   I ought to.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.680]   For people like me,
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.440]   or perhaps you're in the same boat,
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.680]   you can supplement with sulforaphane.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.880]   And what you'll find is that it's sold by various companies
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.480]   and it's available at a quite wide range of dosages.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.200]   You'll see, for instance, two products,
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.680]   similarly priced.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.760]   One product will contain 50 milligrams of sulforaphane.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.840]   The other product will contain
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.280]   225 milligrams of sulforaphane.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   Now, if you go to what I consider
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.480]   a really excellent website for thinking about
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.760]   and evaluating this kind of stuff,
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.000]   which is examine.com.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.020]   I've talked a lot about this site on the podcast before.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.560]   On examine.com,
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.920]   they talk about the translation
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.220]   of the rodent studies to humans.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.640]   And here's what they say.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.240]   They say supplementation of 0.1
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   to 0.5 milligrams per kilogram of sulforaphane in rats
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.360]   has been noted to be bioactive.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.420]   Okay, just bioactive.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.880]   They're not getting specifically
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.080]   at removal of microplastics or nanoplastics.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.320]   And they translate that to a human dose of,
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.520]   okay, if you're 150 pound person,
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.520]   then that's going to be anywhere from 1.1 to 5.5 milligrams
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.200]   for that 150 pound person.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.160]   If you're a 200 pound person,
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.480]   that's approximately my weight.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.360]   I think right now I'm sitting somewhere around 215.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.080]   So about 100 kilograms, 215, I don't know,
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:02.920]   somewhere in there.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   I haven't stood on a scale in a while.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.120]   It's 1.5 to 7.2 milligrams for a 200 pound person.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.160]   Now, then you think about the typical dosages
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.720]   that are found in supplements of 50 milligrams per serving
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.920]   versus 225 milligrams per serving.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.000]   And in either case,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.520]   you realize that that's much, much higher
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.800]   than what's being discussed here.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.960]   So what that says to me is that
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.780]   I would probably go with the lower dosage.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:31.560]   Although according to examine.com, they say, quote,
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.520]   "These low quantities are likely attainable
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.720]   through raw broccoli or cruciferous vegetable products."
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.560]   So that's great.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.700]   What this means is that you don't need to supplement
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.720]   with sulforaphane if you're willing to eat raw broccoli.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.160]   They're specifically saying raw broccoli
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.740]   or other cruciferous vegetable products,
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:49.200]   while higher dosages may be further beneficial.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.120]   So this is still a bit of a vague space.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.680]   I realize there's some discrepancies
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.880]   in what I'm describing here.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.720]   I said you could lightly cook the broccoli or cauliflower.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.360]   That's my read and understanding of sulforaphane,
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.520]   that it's not broken down at low temperatures,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.760]   but perhaps you just decide to eat it raw
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.840]   if you can bear it.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.580]   I can't, so I don't.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:11.560]   You could supplement it if you choose what dosage.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.800]   Well, that depends on your weight.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.880]   And it seems that in any case,
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.400]   most supplements are going to more than cover
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.760]   the amount of sulforaphane that's described here
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.980]   translated from the rat studies.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.180]   So in my case, after researching this episode,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.460]   I opted to start taking 50 milligrams,
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:31.940]   five zero milligrams of sulforaphane per day.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.660]   I'm going to see how that goes.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.340]   I guess it's fair to say that I'm sufficiently concerned
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.820]   about microplastics and nanoplastics,
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.380]   given that I'm 49 years old.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.180]   All my biomarkers seem fine, but hey,
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.440]   I'm always interested in doing something for my health
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.180]   or to promote my health, that is, if I can.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.620]   And it's pretty clear to me that if one's thinking
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.080]   about liver control detoxification,
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.640]   both for sake of offsetting or removing BPAs, BPSs,
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.580]   but also other potentially toxic metabolites
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.260]   from microplastics, nanoplastics,
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.860]   and other environmental factors,
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.300]   that taking 50 milligrams of sulforaphane per day
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.900]   perhaps can be beneficial.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.660]   So I don't think it's necessary for everybody.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.240]   In fact, I think everybody should probably be getting
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.140]   some cruciferous vegetables in their diet anyway,
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.860]   at least once a week or a couple of times a week.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.700]   So if you're not interested in supplementing,
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.580]   that will be the route to go.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.040]   If you are interested in supplementing,
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.340]   I'll provide a link to this particular location
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:27.220]   in the examine.com page so that you can translate
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.660]   some of these dosages to your potential sources
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.580]   of supplemental forms of sulforaphane.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.540]   The other way that microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.200]   can be excreted from the body is in the bowel.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.820]   And one way to potentially increase the amount
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:43.180]   of microplastics and nanoplastics, BPAs, BPSs,
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.980]   phthalates, and forever chemicals,
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:49.460]   those PFASs from your body is to make sure
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.460]   that you're getting enough dietary fiber.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.900]   Now, most people can do that simply by eating
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.560]   a fair amount of fruits and vegetables,
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.060]   which I always make a point to do.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.600]   I also ingest starches, okay?
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.260]   So I'm not pure carnivore.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.860]   Things like rice, like oatmeal, I like fresh pastas,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.660]   although it's mainly rice and oatmeal for me these days
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.420]   in terms of starches, plenty of fruits and vegetables.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.160]   That's something that I just really make it a point to do.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.900]   Why is fiber good at doing this?
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.340]   Well, it can bind lipophilic molecules, okay?
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:21.220]   It can bind molecules that are able to cross cell membranes.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.740]   And earlier, we were talking about the fact that BPA
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:27.820]   and BPSs mimic estrogen and combined estrogen receptors
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.780]   and potentially to androgen receptors as well.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.740]   Keep in mind that one of the reasons
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.980]   why those so-called steroid hormone pathways,
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.240]   I know people hear the word steroid
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.700]   and they think performance enhancing steroids, but no,
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.500]   it turns out that testosterone and estrogen
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.100]   are both steroid hormones.
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.540]   One of the reasons those are interesting
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.380]   is that because of their structure,
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.220]   they're able to bind cell surface receptors
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.460]   and have effects on those cells.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:56.020]   They are also able to pass through, okay, the hormones,
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.900]   okay, here I'm not talking about BPAs and BPSs,
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.060]   but the hormones, testosterone and estrogen
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.900]   can actually get to the nucleus of cells
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.980]   and can control gene expression.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.660]   These steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.380]   work in a very coordinated fashion
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.380]   to create what we call secondary sex characteristics,
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.420]   which are the characteristics of the external body
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.020]   and brain changes and internal changes
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.660]   all over the place, right, ovaries, testes, et cetera,
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.860]   that are what underlie what we call puberty.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.500]   And that's because these molecules
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.020]   can actually control gene expression.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.060]   So when we talk about these molecules like BPAs and BPSs
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.860]   impacting these pathways like estrogen
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.280]   and androgen pathways, this is serious stuff
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.740]   because what you're doing is you're potentially
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:43.020]   activating or blocking pathways that are involved
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.820]   not just in the function of those cells,
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.780]   but actually the genes that those particular cells express.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.100]   And this is particularly concerning
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.160]   for any kind of hormone dependent cancers, right?
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.220]   It's perhaps not surprising to you
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.300]   based on what you now know about how hormones work
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.860]   with gene expression, et cetera,
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.420]   that many tissues that turn over cells a lot,
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.340]   such as the testes, right, producing sperm
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.540]   pretty much throughout the lifespan,
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.460]   the follicle and eggs, right, breast tissue, right,
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.500]   these are common sites of cancer, okay?
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.620]   There are other cancers that can form, of course,
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.860]   in other tissues like the pancreas and brain, et cetera,
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.580]   but tissues that turn over quite a bit
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.340]   because of the involvement of the cell cycle
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.460]   and because cancer is among other things,
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.980]   a dysregulation of the cell cycle
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.780]   and an overproduction of cells that we call tumors.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:31.640]   Those are pathways that are particularly vulnerable
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.020]   to endocrine or hormone disruption.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.700]   And this is why there's additional concern
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.700]   about microplastics and nanoplastics,
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.900]   perhaps increasing cancer rates
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.740]   in particular in tissues like the ovary,
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.660]   in particular, the testes, in particular,
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.760]   any tissue where there's a lot of cellular turnover.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.300]   So the point here is that eating broccoli,
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.220]   eating cauliflower,
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.460]   potentially supplementing with sulforaphane,
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.380]   here I'm summarizing a bit what I talked about earlier,
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.620]   avoiding drinking water from plastic bottles,
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.260]   maybe getting a reverse osmosis filter,
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.780]   avoiding those diabolical canned soups,
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.500]   I had no idea about these canned soups,
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.260]   or ensuring that the canned soups that you're eating
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.020]   are safe in the ways that we discussed earlier,
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.340]   avoiding sea salts,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.980]   avoiding, I'm throwing a few other things in here
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:15.920]   that I haven't mentioned yet,
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.700]   avoiding nonstick pans,
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.360]   trying to cook mainly with cast iron or ceramic
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.660]   and making sure that those are BPA, BPS and PFAS free.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.720]   Just look at the packaging,
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.100]   do a little bit of homework there and get this one.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.620]   This is a really surprising one,
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.300]   or at least it was surprising to me,
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.060]   carbonated water, okay, mineral waters.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.220]   A few years ago,
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.780]   there was an analysis of different popular forms
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.960]   of carbonated water,
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.080]   which is sold in glass containers, okay?
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.940]   It turned out that Topo Chico,
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:48.960]   which I happened, past tense, happened to love,
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.800]   Topo Chico had 9.76 particles per trillion
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.680]   of these PFAS, these forever chemicals, okay?
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.580]   That was an analysis done in 2020.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.660]   Perrier, 1.1, San Pellegrino, 0.31.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   So we're comparing 9.76 versus 1.1 versus 0.31,
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.100]   which tells me I'm avoiding Topo Chico.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.560]   I might even avoid Perrier.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.700]   I'll probably drink San Pellegrino.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:19.860]   I'll probably buy a Perrier
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.620]   and drink a Perrier every once in a while.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.340]   I'm not crazy about carbonated water.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.540]   By the way, this was an analysis by Consumer Reports
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.500]   and it caught some attention,
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.420]   such that the Coca-Cola company,
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.200]   which makes Topo Chico,
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.300]   said that they were going to fix this problem
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.880]   and they claimed, okay,
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.280]   I don't know if they've done this, all right?
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.600]   I don't want to get the folks at Coca-Cola angry with me.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.040]   Coca-Cola claimed that by 2023,
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.000]   they were going to cut the amount of these particles in half,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.560]   but that would still make them 4.5 parts per trillion,
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.040]   still much higher,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   at least four times higher than any of the other brands.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.960]   So I have to be direct.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.840]   I'm just speaking from my own experience and choices.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.300]   Until I see data that Topo Chico has reduced the amount
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:07.300]   of these foreign contaminants to basically less than 0.31,
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.160]   I'm going with San Pellegrino or Perrier.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.840]   Okay, I don't tend to drink a lot of mineral water,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.860]   but given that you're ordering it in the glass,
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.080]   in a glass container, that is,
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.900]   given that these things are not particularly cheap, right?
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.420]   And that you have choices,
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.920]   you could either decide to avoid carbonated water altogether
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.400]   or if you're going to be smart about it,
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.800]   you probably want to avoid the ones
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.920]   that contain more of these foreign contaminants
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.940]   because of their ability to get lodged
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.180]   in different tissues in your body.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.380]   So that was very surprising to me
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.220]   that you would have these forever chemicals
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.780]   in carbonated water.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:42.780]   What it tells us is that the water going into those products
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:47.400]   contains either microplastics, nanoplastics,
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.860]   PFASs from other sources or something.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.240]   And so I think that we should all be aware of this.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.920]   If you're going to drink carbonated water,
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.400]   probably going with a Perrier or San Pellegrino
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.840]   would be better than going with Topo Chico
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.060]   because even though they've halved
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.460]   the amount of these forever chemicals in there,
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.120]   it's still quite high.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.460]   Okay, so I've mentioned some to-dos
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.600]   to reduce your microplastic, nanoplastic,
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.380]   PPA, BPS, and PFAS exposure,
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.260]   such as ingesting cruciferous vegetables,
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.820]   potentially supplementing with sulforaphane,
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.240]   trying to avoid drinking out of plastic water bottles.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.780]   There are a few other things.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.460]   I'll just list off here, keep it relatively short.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.240]   Talked about making sure you're getting enough
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.420]   dietary fiber, I talked before about using a glass
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.000]   or steel vessel and reverse osmosis water,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.480]   using Himalayan salt, avoiding sea salt.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.600]   The other thing that you can do,
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.420]   oh, and I mentioned using cast iron and ceramic
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.920]   as opposed to nonstick cookware whenever you can.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.160]   And if you're going to microwave food,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.280]   making sure that you're doing that on plates
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.360]   or in containers that does not,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.440]   or do not contain plastic of any kind,
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.160]   even if it says microwave safe.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:58.300]   The other thing is to sweat, okay?
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:03.300]   We vastly underestimate or downgrade the power of sweating.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.380]   Sweating is an incredible mechanism.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.840]   Now, I realized that as soon as somebody says,
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.040]   "Sweating is a great way to remove toxins from the body,"
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.340]   that a bunch of people out there get really inflamed,
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.700]   pun intended.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.680]   I'm not saying that.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.760]   What I am saying is that there are a number
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.400]   of different ways for foreign products to leave the body,
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.380]   including urine, feces,
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.860]   but including sweat, okay?
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.580]   So I'm not saying that's going to detox you completely.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.220]   That's not what I'm saying.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.600]   Okay, I don't fall into that camp.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.740]   However, there are a number of beneficial aspects
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.140]   to sweating.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:39.140]   And also there are a number of beneficial aspects
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.620]   to doing the things that make you sweat.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.180]   So I've done entire episodes about deliberate heat exposure.
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.580]   So things like sauna done anywhere from once a week
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.140]   to four times a week.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.340]   Pretty impressive data in terms of reducing
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:53.180]   all cause mortality, improving cardiovascular function.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.820]   It's also for most people pretty pleasant
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:55.900]   to sit in a sauna.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.740]   If you don't have access to a sauna, taking a hot bath,
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.060]   not so hot that you burn yourself,
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.680]   but a hot bath that also will activate
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.580]   some of these same pathways.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.740]   Things like hot yoga,
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.020]   things like going out for a run in a hoodie.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.620]   Trying to get your body to sweat pretty robustly
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.740]   at least once a week is a good idea
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.980]   for all sorts of reasons.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.060]   Also just your ability to thermoregulate.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.220]   By the way, for those of you that don't sweat much,
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.960]   sweating is actually something that you can get better at.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.800]   That's right.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.220]   You can get better at sweating by what?
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.540]   By sweating, by exposing yourself in safe ways to heat.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:29.380]   And I talk about that
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.500]   in the deliberate heat exposure episode.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.760]   We also have a newsletter on deliberate heat exposure.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.260]   I'll put links to those in the show note captions
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.300]   and those explain safe ways to encourage sweating.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.300]   Why am I talking about this?
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.180]   Well, sweating may help remove some of the things
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.700]   that are attached to microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.780]   that can act as endocrine disruptors.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.060]   It's very, very unlikely that the microplastics
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.000]   and nanoplastics would actually be removed
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.560]   as whole particles in sweat.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.400]   I think that's very unlikely, frankly.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.320]   What's more likely is that the microplastics
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.840]   and nanoplastics aren't really getting removed from
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.020]   or broken down within our body at all.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.680]   They're getting lodged in these different tissues
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.520]   but the stuff that's on them and in them
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.920]   is potentially causing some of the biological harms
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.440]   that we've talked about.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.280]   And so removing those more robustly
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.840]   is what sweating is about.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.060]   It's what consuming cruciferous vegetables is about
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.360]   and so on and so forth.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.160]   So those are a few more to dos.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.840]   The other two don'ts, or I should say don'ts,
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.780]   are things like avoiding consumption of packaged food
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.600]   or food that's packaged in plastic.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.000]   Now, this is tough to do.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.520]   You know, I love berries, for instance.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.660]   I love blueberries.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.760]   I'm what you call a drive-by blueberry eater.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.600]   If there's blueberries in a bowl,
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.000]   I just kind of like sweep them up by the fistful.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.580]   So if there are blueberries on the counter,
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.720]   you're probably not getting very many.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.960]   I'm getting most of them.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.400]   I love blueberries,
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.520]   but I noticed that I was starting to accumulate.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.960]   And of course, I recycle those blueberry containers
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.760]   that are those plastic containers.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.480]   One way that you can avoid plastic packaging
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.140]   is go to farmer's markets, bring your own bags,
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.080]   bring your own baskets.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.180]   I love that the farmer's markets,
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.680]   they have those cardboard containers.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.920]   Of course, some of you may be shouting,
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.240]   "Wait, but those are colored green
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.500]   and the coloration is a problem
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.240]   and they have the microfibers with the..."
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.340]   True, but probably better than plastic containers
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.880]   that they use now in the grocery store
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.380]   for pretty much every fruit and vegetable, okay?
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.800]   So solution is either farmer's markets
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.760]   or trying to bring your own bags to the grocery store.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.320]   I know this is starting to sound kind of hippy-dippy,
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.980]   but these little things make a big difference over time.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.360]   You're reducing your plastic waste,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.520]   you're reducing the amount of plastic exposure
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.100]   of the fruits and vegetables you eat.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.760]   This can correspond to a real difference
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.840]   in the number of microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.000]   and the bad stuff that comes with them that you ingest.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.040]   And again, most of the time,
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   these things are going to save you cost
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.840]   as opposed to introduce new costs.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.020]   The other don'ts that we haven't talked so much about
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:53.140]   are to reduce the number of clothes that you purchase.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:53.980]   I know this might seem like,
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.600]   "Oh my God, where's this all going?"
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.000]   But it turns out that one of the major sources
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.920]   of microplastics and nanoplastics are the microfibers
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.440]   on clothing that come off in washing machines
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.840]   that then get distributed into the oceans through the water
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.460]   or that escape into the air.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.160]   There are a number of ways that you can trap those.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.120]   There are the things like the guppy bag that you can,
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.040]   I love the name, the guppy bag that you can buy
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.440]   at pretty low cost.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.120]   You can find those easily online
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.760]   that will trap some of that stuff.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.080]   There are filters that you can put
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.680]   within specific washing machines.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.480]   Some places actually require this now
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.560]   that capture those microfibers.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.420]   These microfibers, when I first heard about them,
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.260]   I thought, "Oh my goodness,
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.560]   "are we really talking about microfibers in clothing?"
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.600]   Well, just, I don't know, wear 100% cotton clothing.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.880]   But then you find out, because I read this book,
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.560]   this scary book, and it is scary.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.000]   It does kind of bum you out
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.080]   when you start reading this stuff
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.780]   that when you read "A Poison Like No Other,"
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.800]   how microplastics corrupted our planet and our bodies,
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.040]   you find out that so much of the waste
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.440]   that exists in landfills is clothing
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.440]   that people have discarded.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.400]   And there was nothing wrong with that clothing.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.600]   The clothing has dyes, it has little microfibers.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.680]   This stuff gets into the environment,
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.320]   gets into the oceans.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.280]   Here's the simple solution to all this.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.080]   It turns out that we replace far more clothing
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.360]   than we need to.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.040]   Okay, this is actually a great relief to me
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:15.040]   because I love few things more, in terms of clothing anyway,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.300]   the feeling of a T-shirt that I've worn many, many times,
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.340]   and it's really, really soft and kind of worn down,
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.420]   that kind of distressed look T-shirt.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:24.100]   Even though that might be fashionable to some people,
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.000]   to some people it's not,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.180]   I love the feeling of a really worn down, soft T-shirt.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.780]   Even the ones that have a little bit of, you know,
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.020]   sort of a jagged toothing along the collar.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.720]   Now, some people might loathe that.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.180]   They only want the pristine T-shirt that is super crisp.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.020]   That's not me.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.720]   I know I own a few of these black button down shirts,
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.260]   and indeed the same ones, I use them over and over again.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.700]   I do own a fair number of them,
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.580]   but I use the same ones over and over again.
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.960]   And I think that's in keeping with this other recommendation,
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.300]   which this book, "A Poison Like No Other" said,
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.480]   could make a major dent in the amount of microplastics
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.420]   and nanoplastics that are out there in the environment
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.620]   that we end up ingesting,
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.780]   and that the other animals on the planet
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:03.980]   who are so very important end up ingesting
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.580]   and potentially suffering from.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.040]   And that's to simply not buy or replace
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:09.880]   so much of our clothing,
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.940]   but to reuse our clothing.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:13.620]   Now, the argument has been made,
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.060]   and they counter it in the book.
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.080]   Well, then you're just going to wash
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.380]   the same clothing over and over.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.260]   You're going to break down those microfibers
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.580]   and introduce those dyes and things
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.180]   into the ocean, et cetera, into the air.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:27.500]   But it turns out that when you reuse the same clothing
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.940]   and wash it over and over again,
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.580]   you actually see a diminishment
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.220]   in the amount of microfibers and the amount of dyes
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.060]   and things that you extract from those clothing over time.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.620]   Okay, so now in some odd way,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.640]   we're talking about clothing purchases
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.620]   or non-purchases in this case on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.800]   But, you know, in researching this episode,
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.920]   I discovered that these are a major source,
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.300]   if not the major source of microplastic
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.800]   and nanoplastic particles in the environment
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.240]   and landfills, ocean, air, et cetera.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.360]   So while none of us, I believe none of us
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.120]   are going to go out there and create a tire
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.920]   that doesn't degrade as quickly as current tires, right?
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.760]   Most of us don't have the capacity to do that.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.820]   Let's face it, we got to get around in vehicles.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.060]   All those tires breaking down,
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.540]   not a whole lot we can do about that.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.240]   We're inhaling all that stuff,
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.620]   but we can make the decision to use the clothing
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.580]   that we've got for longer periods of time.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.740]   Is it really necessary to keep buying more and more clothes
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.540]   and replacing the old clothes, throwing out the old clothes
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.560]   or even donating those old clothes?
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.540]   Who knows?
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.980]   I'm all for donating clothing after you're done with it.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.900]   But now I have justification
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.740]   for just keeping the t-shirts that I have,
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.840]   making them softer and softer and softer over time.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.800]   And I should mention that of course,
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.480]   when you wear clothing
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.480]   that is shedding these microfiber particles,
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.660]   you're ingesting or rather you're inhaling more typically
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.680]   the microfibers and the microplastics and the nanoplastics
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.920]   and all the bad goodies that go with them.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.000]   As I say that, I think we need to be fair
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.240]   about what that means and what it doesn't mean.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.720]   I personally just don't see myself going around
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.560]   and looking at labels,
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.020]   finding only a hundred percent cotton
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.180]   with no microfiber shedding, no dyes, et cetera.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.760]   I mean, there are a lot of things that are now introduced
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.780]   to even a hundred percent cotton clothing
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.540]   that make them a little bit more water and stain resistant.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.860]   It's very, very difficult
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.420]   to find such sources of clothing, right?
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.700]   I know they're out there, but they're very difficult to find
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.820]   and they're quite costly in many cases.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:23.180]   If you happen to know of some true low cost versions
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.020]   of those things,
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.820]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.060]   But I think we have to be realistic here.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.220]   Plastics were introduced in the 1950s.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.420]   They are everywhere.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.580]   They are in our clothing.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.540]   They are in tires.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.700]   They are in medical devices.
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.140]   They're just everywhere.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.700]   The point of this discussion today
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.020]   is not to try and eliminate plastics.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.260]   I don't think that's reasonable.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.900]   I don't even think that would be useful
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.740]   relative to the incredibly powerful use of plastics
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.900]   in just about every industry.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.340]   There's always a trade-off with these sorts of things.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.660]   And I acknowledge that.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.260]   What I'm talking about is trying to limit your exposure
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:00.540]   and trying to buffer yourself against this bioaccumulation
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:03.020]   in ways that can protect your endocrine system,
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.420]   protect your brain, protect your cardiovascular system,
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:06.540]   protect your liver,
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.020]   protect the organs and tissue systems of your body
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:11.420]   so that you can thrive as much as possible.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:15.140]   So there are some other not to dos or things to avoid.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.220]   Microwave popcorn turns out to be a major source
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:18.060]   of these things.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.540]   Basically any bag or container,
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.220]   canned bag or plastic that has a lining
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:25.420]   that prevents oily stuff from staining it
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.980]   and getting through such as microwave popcorn,
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.140]   very likely is a source or I should say a rich source
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.700]   of microplastics, nanoplastics and endocrine disruptors.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:35.420]   Does that mean that if you have some microwave popcorn
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.260]   every once in a while,
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.420]   that's going to screw up your estrogen
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:40.020]   or testosterone system and make you infertile?
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:41.420]   No, I don't believe that.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.820]   These things are all a matter of dosage,
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:47.100]   exposure over time and so on.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.620]   Toothpaste and plastic tubing,
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.140]   another rich source of microplastics,
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.060]   nanoplastics that people ingest.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.740]   Of course, because you're putting it in your mouth.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.240]   When I did the oral health episode,
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.300]   I talked about some tooth tablets.
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:58.740]   I've become quite fond of these.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.060]   I have no financial relationship
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.500]   to the company that makes these,
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.740]   but these are two tablets
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.140]   that include something called hydroxyapatite,
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.700]   which is great for the remineralization of teeth
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.500]   'cause it turns out your teeth can fill in little cavities
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.820]   that start to form and overall tooth health.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.540]   It's also great for travel 'cause first of all,
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.780]   these things come in a glass jar, so no plastic.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.500]   You take the tooth tablets and you just chew them up
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.140]   and then you brush your teeth.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.420]   It's great because you don't have to worry
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:24.240]   about how many ounces is going through the screening process
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.120]   at the airport because it's not a liquid.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.340]   It's not a paste.
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.180]   It's a tablet.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.100]   They're super convenient.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:30.940]   I love those.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.460]   We'll probably link to those in the show note captions,
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:34.060]   even though I have no relationship to the company.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.060]   I'm just a big fan of that sort of thing,
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.220]   the convenience and the fact that it's housed in glass.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:42.180]   But as I say all this stuff, right?
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.400]   Avoiding drinking out of plastic.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.960]   Don't turn over your clothing so much.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.540]   Wash your clothes, but don't purchase
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:53.280]   and throw away clothing too much or more than is necessary.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.540]   Avoiding sea salt, these kinds of things.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:59.540]   These are all just choices for you in the buffet of options
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.660]   of ways to reduce your microplastic,
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.660]   nanoplastic ingestion and exposure
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.220]   and the bioaccumulation of those things over time
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:11.220]   and to increase in the case of things like sulforaphane
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:14.340]   and sweating, et cetera, and to increase the detoxification
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.860]   and removal of some of the more harmful products attached
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.580]   to or within these microplastics and nanoplastics, right?
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.980]   I certainly don't expect anyone, including myself,
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:25.960]   to start living a life free of microplastics
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.080]   and nanoplastics.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.240]   To do that, you'd probably have to leave planet earth.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.080]   I know certain people are developing plans
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.840]   to enable us to do that, even if we're not astronauts.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.760]   And frankly, when you get out to Mars
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.440]   or you get it into outer space,
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.060]   those microplastics and nanoplastics,
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.760]   based on everything I've learned
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.860]   and how incredibly sneaky, small, and pervasive they are,
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.680]   well, they're probably in outer space as well.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.160]   Now, the final thing I want to touch on
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.600]   is the potential role of microplastics, nanoplastics,
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.480]   BPAs, BPSs, and forever chemicals on the developing brain.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:59.520]   And this is an area that I'm very familiar with
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.160]   because much of my career,
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.800]   I've focused on brain development, neural development.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.520]   And one can find a lot of papers out there
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.360]   about the potential neurotoxicity of micro and nanoplastics,
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.760]   certainly the established neurotoxicity of microplastics
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.400]   and nanoplastics in animal models
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.120]   and the potential neurotoxicity
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.160]   of those things in human tissues.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.360]   Now, of course, because this animal literature
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.400]   and some correlative human literature
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.080]   have been out there for a while,
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.640]   the media and some people in particular
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.360]   have become concerned about
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.000]   and have mentioned the potential role
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.120]   of microplastics, nanoplastics,
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.920]   and the bad goodies that attach to them or come from them
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:44.560]   in potentially causing neurodevelopmental disorders
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.760]   such as autism and ADHD.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.080]   I want to be very clear.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.200]   I went into this literature, I read this review.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.080]   It's a quite nice review.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.840]   The plastic brain neurotoxicity of micro and nanoplastics.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.520]   And sure, there's a lot of animal literature
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.600]   showing for instance,
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.560]   that there's a disruption in certain enzymatic pathways
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.200]   within neurons in particular,
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.920]   and this is the one that intrigues me the most,
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.120]   a disruption in what's called acetylcholine esterase.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.880]   Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.360]   involved in neuroplasticity, in attention,
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.520]   among other things, levels of alertness,
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.520]   a number of things,
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.240]   including control of the so-called neuromuscular junctions
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.040]   that allow for us to move our limbs.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.640]   Acetylcholine esterase is involved in the degradation,
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.160]   the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.360]   So neurons release acetylcholine into the synapse
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.280]   where it can have an effect on muscle
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.040]   or it can have an effect on other neurons
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.200]   if we're talking about within the brain.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.880]   And indeed, there's a fair amount of evidence
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.840]   showing that microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.080]   are correlated with reductions in,
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.280]   or just changes in acetylcholine esterase activity.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.080]   Now it is true that where acetylcholine is released
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.440]   in the brain, it can impinge on dopamine circuits
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:56.200]   that are involved in reward pathways and movement.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.540]   But I want to be clear,
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:00.840]   people have taken some of those findings,
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.840]   translated them to the correlative data in humans,
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.520]   and have started to link the presence of microplastics
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.920]   and nanoplastics, in their words, not mine,
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.720]   in their words, to neurodevelopmental disorders
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.000]   such as autism and ADHD.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.920]   And while there is some evidence
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.120]   that some of the behavioral components
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.800]   or cognitive components of autism and ADHD
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:27.560]   may increase in line with increases in microplastic
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.120]   or nanoplastic exposure,
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.280]   the data there are still, in my opinion, very, very weak.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.920]   So in my opinion, it's far too early to conclude
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.960]   that microplastics and nanoplastics have any role
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.320]   and certainly not a causal role
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.840]   in the development of autism or ADHD
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.620]   or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.880]   That said, the presence of microplastics
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.040]   and nanoplastics in placenta
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.520]   and in that first stool from babies,
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.320]   which shows us that those microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320]   are getting into the developing fetus,
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.240]   well, that does, I think, raise level of concern,
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.340]   and it certainly should motivate pregnant women,
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:04.200]   as well as people who have newborn kids
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.680]   or are going to have kids
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.640]   to look around their home environment,
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.800]   think about the things they're putting into their body
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.000]   or the vessels they're using to ingest liquids,
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:12.840]   to ingest foods,
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:16.940]   and to start limiting microplastic and nanoplastic exposure,
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:20.300]   certainly during, but also perhaps before pregnancy
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:23.700]   and after pregnancy when one is breastfeeding.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.620]   So the point here is that we can't draw a direct relationship
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.380]   between microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.740]   and neurodevelopmental disorders.
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:32.480]   I don't think it would be appropriate at all to do that.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.680]   However, given that microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.580]   have these issues, both from their own breakdown,
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:39.740]   their presence, right,
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.740]   their own structural presence can be a problem,
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.560]   the chemicals within them can be a problem,
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.140]   the chemicals that attach to them
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:47.140]   can be a problem potentially,
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.820]   I think learning to limit our exposure
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.660]   throughout our lifespan,
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:54.300]   learning to reduce the bioaccumulation
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.540]   through detoxification and excretion pathways
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.340]   using the various approaches that we talked about,
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:02.580]   and certainly to pay extra attention to those things
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.780]   around the time of, meaning before, during,
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.700]   and after pregnancy is especially important
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.420]   because we just don't know all the things
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.160]   that these chemicals and these plastics are doing,
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.660]   but none of them seem to be very good,
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.180]   at least not in terms of the ways
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:19.220]   that they impact our brain and bodily tissues.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:23.040]   Okay, so today we've talked a lot about microplastics,
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.820]   what they are, where they're found,
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.380]   how they get into our body,
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.580]   where they get lodged within our body,
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.220]   what they potentially do in our body,
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.780]   none of which is good.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.260]   Some might be innocuous, some might be bad,
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:38.060]   none of which, at least as far as I know, is good,
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.860]   and some ways, both through some to-dos
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:46.300]   and some to-avoids, that we can increase our excretion
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.580]   or our breakdown and removal of the bad stuff
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:53.300]   on and in microplastics and nanoplastics.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.180]   And I realized that even though we covered a lot of things,
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.620]   we also just scratched the surface.
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:01.900]   For instance, we know that receipts
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:05.140]   are rich sources of BPAs, okay?
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.320]   So if you are somebody who handles receipts a lot
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.260]   for your job, probably best to use nitrile gloves, okay?
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.800]   Not latex gloves, but nitrile gloves.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.360]   Those are going to protect your hands.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.860]   If you're somebody who purchases things,
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.260]   maybe just say, "No, thanks.
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.720]   "I'll take the electronic receipt," or "No receipt."
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.000]   Okay, however, we need to be reasonable here as well.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]   Does this mean that if you touch a receipt
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.480]   that you're going to screw up your testosterone
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.320]   or estrogen?
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.680]   No, but you probably don't want to be rubbing those receipts.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.200]   And it's very clear that if you use sunscreen
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.240]   or lotions of any kind on your hands,
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.500]   you handle receipts, it can increase the access
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.360]   of those BPAs to your bloodstream.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.280]   And if you're somebody who handles receipts a lot,
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.560]   well then, probably best to use those nitrile gloves.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.680]   The point here is that there are a lot of different sources
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:51.200]   of these BPAs, BPSs, PFAS, so-called forever chemicals,
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.920]   microplastics, nanoplastics.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.800]   I also would just encourage you to do your research.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.480]   Look at the cans that you drink from.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.560]   Ensure that they don't include BPAs.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.600]   Look at the different things
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.080]   that you cook with in your kitchen.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.680]   Try and cook from cast iron or ceramic.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.840]   And if you don't, look at the other pans and cans
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.280]   and things in your environment
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.800]   and see what your likely exposure to these BPAs, BPSs,
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.920]   and forever chemicals is, and make choices accordingly.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.480]   That's what today's episode,
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.020]   and frankly, this podcast is about.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.580]   It's about you being informed and making the best choices
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:23.240]   for your mental health and physical health.

[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.800]   I do read all the comments.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.940]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.120]   I have a new book coming out.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.760]   It's my very first book.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.160]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.300]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.480]   This is a book that I've been working on
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.640]   for more than five years,
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.960]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.520]   of research and experience.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.320]   And it covers protocols for everything
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.060]   from sleep to exercise to stress control,
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:15.520]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.880]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.960]   for the protocols that are included.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.860]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.240]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.000]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.760]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.340]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.320]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.300]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.880]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.760]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.320]   And on all those platforms,
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.440]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.920]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.400]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.280]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.480]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.520]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.

[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.880]   our Neural Network newsletter
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.920]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.560]   that includes podcast summaries as well as protocols
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.400]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.680]   Those protocol PDFs are on things
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.560]   like neuroplasticity and learning,
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.160]   optimizing dopamine, improving your sleep,
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.320]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.400]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.560]   that describes a template routine
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.080]   that includes cardiovascular training
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.040]   and resistance training with sets and reps,
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.480]   all backed by science,
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.880]   and all of which, again, is completely zero cost.

[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:44.240]   all about microplastics and nanoplastics.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.520]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.680]   thank you for your interest in science.
