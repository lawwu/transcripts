[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.300]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.460]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.780]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.820]   Today, we are discussing music and your brain.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.340]   However, this episode could have just as easily
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.560]   been entitled Music is Your Brain or Your Brain is Music.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040]   And that's because music, believe it or not,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.300]   is a neurological phenomenon.
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.760]   Most of us think of music as something
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.440]   that happens outside of us.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.920]   The sounds we hear, the lyrics we hear, their meaning,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.740]   how they anchor us to pieces of our history,
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.960]   both emotional or social.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.120]   It turns out that when we listen to music,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.320]   it activates nearly every piece of our brain.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.920]   Moreover, when we listen to music,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.280]   it activates our brain in ways that our brain itself,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.140]   and indeed our body as well, help to create that music
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.080]   at the level of so-called neural ensembles,
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.060]   that is the firing of neurons.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.240]   In other words, when we listen to music,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.500]   our brain and our body become part of the instrument
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200]   that contributes to our perception of that music.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.640]   Today, I'm going to make clear how all of that happens.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.320]   We will also discuss how music can be leveraged
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.240]   towards shifting our brain states and our bodily states.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.720]   For instance, what sorts of music to listen to
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480]   in order to make ourselves happy.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.400]   Yes, studies have been done on that,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.420]   as well as how long to listen to music
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.760]   in order to shift our mood or our overall bodily state,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.360]   including how to process feelings of sadness.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.640]   Many of you are probably familiar with particular songs
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.220]   that anchor us to particular times in our history
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.760]   or people in our history.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.320]   And there's an age-old question really
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.460]   as to whether or not listening to sad music
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.440]   can help us process our feelings of sadness
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.620]   or whether or not they drive us further down the spiral
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.240]   of sadness and despair.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.880]   And indeed, studies have explored this as well.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.040]   So today I will explain how music,
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.300]   indeed how different types of music,
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.440]   activate different neural circuits in your brain
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.660]   to create different brain and bodily states,
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.500]   how we can leverage music
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440]   toward things like emotional processing,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.940]   shifting our emotions,
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.560]   as well as to enhance learning and memory.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.760]   And we will also talk about the use of music
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.440]   to enhance brain plasticity,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.620]   that is your brain's ability to change
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.040]   in response to experience,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.320]   not just in response to that music,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.440]   but rather using music as a tool
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.320]   to expand our capacity for neuroplasticity,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.400]   giving us the ability to learn far more
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800]   in other contexts and areas of life.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.980]   I confess that in researching this episode,
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.280]   I found myself continually delighted as to,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.180]   first of all, how impressive the science
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.160]   of the study of music in the brain is,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.040]   and secondly, how fundamental music is to all of our lives.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.160]   And this is true whether or not
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.000]   you're somebody who listens to music often
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.200]   or you're somebody that really prefers silence.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.720]   Indeed, we will talk about whether or not
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.600]   it's better to listen to music or remain in silence
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.320]   when you perform certain kinds of work.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.720]   It turns out that there's a very clear answer to that.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.440]   If you want a little bit of a hint,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.800]   it is best to listen to music in between bouts of work
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.320]   or during brief rest periods,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.440]   as opposed to listening to music while you work.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.520]   And for those of you that listen to music while you work
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.320]   and thoroughly enjoy listening to music while you work,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.020]   we will also discuss what that means
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.380]   about your brain in particular,
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.880]   because it's likely that it got wired up that way
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   at a particular phase of development.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.540]   And each and all of you can learn today
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.740]   how to best leverage music toward productivity,
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.100]   but perhaps equally important,
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.940]   how to leverage music for enrichment and enjoyment of life.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.740]   I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.380]   three live events in Australia.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.940]   All three events will cover science
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.060]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.680]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   There will also be a live question and answer session.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.180]   The first live event will take place on February 10th
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.900]   in Melbourne at the Plenary Theater.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.520]   The second live event will take place
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.240]   on February 17th in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.880]   And the third event will take place on February 23rd
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.940]   in Brisbane at the Great Hall.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.620]   To access tickets to any of these events,
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.440]   simply go to Hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.240]   and use the code Huberman.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.560]   I hope to see you there.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.540]   And last, but certainly not least,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.340]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.280]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.300]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.940]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.240]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.140]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.540]   to the general public.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.700]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.520]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.620]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.340]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.220]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.300]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.940]   about the fact that sleep,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.740]   that is getting enough quality sleep each night,
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.720]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.300]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.260]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.600]   is to make sure that your body temperature drops
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.980]   by about one to three degrees at the beginning of the night.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.880]   Indeed, that is how your body falls and stays deeply asleep.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.780]   As well, in order to wake up in the morning
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.640]   feeling refreshed, your bodily temperature
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.020]   needs to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.600]   Eight Sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.840]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.820]   allowing you to fall and stay deeply asleep
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.140]   throughout the night and to wake up feeling refreshed.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.080]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.660]   well over two years ago,
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.760]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.780]   It's allowed me to fall asleep more quickly.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.100]   It's allowed me to sleep more deeply throughout the night.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.920]   And if I happen to wake up during the middle of the night,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.820]   something that's perfectly normal to do once or even twice,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.800]   I fall back asleep far more quickly
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280]   and I wake up feeling refreshed as a consequence.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.260]   My mood focus and alertness throughout the day
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.580]   is greatly elevated as compared to prior to sleeping
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.460]   on my Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.460]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.020]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.900]   to save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.580]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.940]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.820]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.660]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.700]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.440]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.280]   the visual system,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.520]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.100]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.740]   in order for you to be able to see clearly
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.900]   in different environments.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.140]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.140]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.740]   so that you always see with crystal clarity.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.980]   Originally, their glasses were designed for performance,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.580]   that is for running and cycling and for sport,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.660]   and indeed they can still be used for performance.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.620]   They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty,
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.860]   they're extremely lightweight,
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.820]   but I should mention that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.860]   come in some of the aesthetics more typically associated
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.160]   with performance glasses, like those cyborg style glasses,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.740]   but they also have a number of styles
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.160]   that you would be perfectly comfortable
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.820]   wearing out to dinner or to work.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.500]   I wear readers at night or when I drive,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.460]   and I wear sunglasses during the day
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.020]   if I happen to be driving into bright light or outside
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.640]   and it's just overwhelmingly bright.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.840]   I do not wear sunglasses
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   when I do my morning sunlight viewing
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.660]   to set my circadian rhythm,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.980]   and I suggest that you do the same.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.420]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.020]   you can go to roca, R-O-K-A, .com
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.360]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.700]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.380]   Okay, let's talk about music and your brain.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.380]   And to start off, I just want to take a step back
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.260]   and acknowledge something
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.320]   that is absolutely remarkable about music,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.740]   which is if you think about language,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.500]   I could describe to you a glass,
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.020]   I could describe to you an apple,
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.740]   I could describe to you a story,
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.060]   I could describe to you a face,
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.980]   I could describe to you any number of different things
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.980]   and you could do the same for me.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.700]   Language is essentially infinite in the number of things
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.060]   that it can explain and the ways that it can explain it.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.700]   And yet, if you think about music,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.400]   music provided there are no lyrics in that music,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.580]   can't explain how a glass is shaped.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.660]   It can't even tell you that there's a glass present
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.280]   in the room or on a table.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.180]   It can't tell you what a face looks like.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.500]   It can't tell you what that person
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.340]   who owns that face did or is doing.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.940]   So in some ways you might think, wow,
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.460]   music is fairly diminished in terms of its qualitative depth
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.700]   compared to language.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.980]   And yet, if you take a step back
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.340]   and think about what music can do, it's astonishing
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.220]   and it actually overwhelms what language can do.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.380]   What can music do?
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.500]   Well, even in the absence of any lyrics,
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.220]   any words put to music, music can describe an emotion.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.180]   In fact, music can describe numerous types of emotions
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.060]   and it can do it with a lot of nuance.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.020]   So not just displaying for us happy or sad,
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.360]   but rather different degrees of happiness,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.780]   different degrees of sadness.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.600]   Music can be used to convey a sense of longing,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.660]   a sense of nostalgia, a sense of delight,
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.060]   a sense of awe and on and on.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.680]   So whereas music can't describe nouns very well,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.940]   it can beautifully describe emotions.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.300]   And not only can music describe emotions
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.340]   with a tremendous degree of nuance,
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.820]   music can evoke emotions
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.660]   with a tremendous degree of nuance.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.740]   Now, this is spectacular and it's not only spectacular,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.180]   it is important because as we move through today's episode,
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.880]   you'll soon come to realize that it's very likely,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.940]   and indeed we have a lot of scientific evidence
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.900]   to support the fact that music evolved
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.060]   prior to spoken language.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.760]   Moreover, it's very likely that singing evolved
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.220]   prior to spoken language and that music, singing and dance
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.080]   together evolved prior to language,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.740]   making music as well as singing and dance,
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.740]   but really just music even on its own
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.700]   in the absence of any lyrics or any bodily movement
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.000]   as the fundamental form of human communication.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.100]   Indeed, music can evoke empathy.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.380]   Again, we're talking about music
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.220]   in the absence of any lyrics.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.600]   And when I say music can evoke empathy,
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.480]   I'm not talking about the sort of empathy
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.740]   where you look at somebody and nod and understand
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.860]   so-called cognitive empathy,
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.940]   which is important by the way in relational dynamics,
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.580]   or emotional empathy where you're actually feeling
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.860]   what the other person is feeling,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.420]   but of course you never really know
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.500]   what somebody else is feeling, how could you?
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.220]   You can only have a sense of what they might be feeling
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.560]   and you have a sense of what you're feeling,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.340]   but let's be honest, as one of our prior guests
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.400]   on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Carl Deisseroth,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   so aptly noted, rarely do we ever understand
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.280]   how anyone else truly feels because indeed rarely
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.740]   do we ever understand how we ourselves truly feel.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.160]   And certainly with language,
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.900]   it's very hard to explain our feelings with words
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.600]   in a way that can convey the way that we feel
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.760]   with the kind of nuance that represents our own reality.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.220]   Even in a state of extreme happiness or extreme sadness,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.080]   words fall short of explaining how we feel inside.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.480]   And yet, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.980]   music not only can describe emotions,
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.220]   it can evoke emotions within us.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.920]   And in doing so, it can evoke emotions
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.660]   that give us a sense of empathy for the person
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.800]   playing the music or simply for others in the world.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.220]   And music can do that so powerfully
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.420]   because not only does music come in through our ears,
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.820]   and we'll talk about the process of how sound is converted
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.140]   into what we perceive as music in a little bit,
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.340]   because indeed it comes in through our ears
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.040]   and we can hear that music, of course,
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.860]   but the nerve cells, the neurons in your brain,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.280]   as well as the nerve cells in your body
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.940]   can become activated by music in a way
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.540]   that the firing of those neurons,
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.060]   literally the frequency of those neural impulses
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.880]   comes to match the frequency of the sounds
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.200]   that you're hearing in your outside environment.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.860]   In other words, when you listen to music,
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.340]   not only is that music coming into your body
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.180]   through your sense organs, your hearing,
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.600]   but your body itself is an instrument
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.820]   playing that music from within.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.360]   So for instance, if you listen to a piece of music
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.140]   that has a lightness to it, that evokes a sense in you
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.460]   of the turning of the seasons from winter to spring,
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.600]   something that's common in certain classical music,
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.060]   but other forms of music as well.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.720]   When you hear that music, indeed,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.040]   it's coming in through your ears,
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.480]   but also the firing of the neurons in your brain and body
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.500]   responding to those particular frequencies of sound
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.320]   is such that your body itself is an instrument
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.640]   playing that sense of the turning of the seasons
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.460]   from winter to spring within you,
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.860]   which is why your body starts to feel lifted in some cases,
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.340]   or it starts to feel a lightness in some cases,
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.340]   and an entire set of emotions starts to be recruited
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.060]   that at least for you resemble the turning of the seasons
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.140]   from winter to spring.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.580]   Now that may sound rather complex,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.120]   but we're going to break that process down
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.220]   into its component parts.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.200]   But what I essentially just said
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.940]   is that when you listen to music,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.820]   not only are you hearing that music,
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.220]   but your body, that is your neurons,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.260]   and indeed your hormones as well,
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.340]   things like oxytocin and some other hormones
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.180]   in your brain and body that we'll discuss,
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.980]   are contributing to a symphony of emotion
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.660]   from within your body and brain.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.520]   Okay, so while music can't explain objects,
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.980]   it can't describe them,
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.940]   it can explain in a very nuanced ways emotions,
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.740]   and it can evoke emotions within us.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.660]   Now, if that's not amazing enough,
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.420]   music can not only describe and evoke emotions,
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.060]   it can also imply intent.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.780]   Think for instance about drumming
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.340]   that you would hear off in the distance,
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.180]   and we're not talking about,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.980]   [imitates drumming]
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.920]   we're talking drumming of this sort.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   [imitates drumming]
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.520]   And perhaps the cadence of that drumming changes
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.420]   such that as it's approaching,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.180]   it gets more and more frequent.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.340]   [imitates drumming]
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.720]   What is the intent being implied?
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.020]   Well, we know from numerous studies
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.780]   and you know from numerous movies that you've seen and heard
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.720]   that that sort of low frequency drumming
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.860]   of increasing cadence as it approaches
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.900]   is implying the intent of aggression or war,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.740]   or at least is implying that something serious
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.980]   is going to happen.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.740]   Now contrast that with a different frequency of sound
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.300]   played at a higher cadence.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.100]   [imitates drumming]
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.140]   Now, the second set of tones,
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.620]   [imitates drumming]
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.420]   are far less clear in terms of what they mean,
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.100]   what their intent is.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.180]   But if we contrast them with,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.020]   let's just call them what they're typically called
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.180]   the war drums or the drums that convey a sense
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.020]   of aggressive intent.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.980]   [imitates drumming]
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.380]   What we create then is a juxtaposition
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.780]   of two different emotional states in you perhaps,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.080]   or maybe you don't respond to those
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.460]   with any robust emotional shift,
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.120]   but we are conveying two separate
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.720]   or distinct sets of intent.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.620]   Now of course, spoken language can convey intent.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.460]   I could say, for instance, you know, I'm going to help you.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.540]   How can I help you today?
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.180]   Or I could say, I'm going to hurt you, right?
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.900]   Of course, with spoken language, you could do that
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.020]   and you could change the intonation of that language,
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.380]   you could change the frequency.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.740]   So if I were to say, I'm going to hurt you,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.760]   it's very different than if I say, I'm going to hurt you.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.060]   Okay, or if I put it as a question, I'm going to hurt you.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.500]   Okay, so with language, of course,
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.640]   there's also the opportunity for a lot of nuance,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.160]   depending on where the inflections,
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.780]   where the accents are on a particular phrase,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.580]   even a particular word.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.960]   But with music, as you recall,
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.040]   when we convey a sense of intent,
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.140]   we are also conveying that sense of intent
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.160]   through the body of the listener,
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.020]   not just bringing it in through their ears.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.300]   And so when we do that,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.440]   what we do is we start to recruit a huge number
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   of neural circuits that are involved,
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.560]   not just in understanding or a sense of empathy
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.500]   for an emotion, but rather that can recruit movement
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.720]   or what we call pre-motor circuits in the body.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.580]   Pre-motor circuits are the neurons that start to fire
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.020]   before a particular pattern of action is generated.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.400]   And so when we hear music that conveys emotion,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.740]   that evokes emotion, and especially when we hear music
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.940]   that conveys a sense of intent from the outside,
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.560]   we too start to feel as if we need to move
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.780]   or respond to that music in a particular way.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.220]   Now, what I just described to you
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.780]   is not something that's learned.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.260]   In fact, it is innate.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.220]   How do we know that?
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.380]   Well, there are some beautiful studies
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.840]   that have explored how babies respond to music,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.140]   indeed, how babies respond to specific types of music,
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.080]   specific frequencies of sound,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.180]   spacing between particular notes, and on and on.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.000]   It's been demonstrated, for instance,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.960]   that babies as young as three months old
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.100]   respond to music very differently than they respond
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.340]   to just other forms of sound scrambled in time.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.120]   Now, of course, babies that are three months old
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.740]   aren't speaking, so you could ask them,
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.920]   does that sound like music?
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.360]   How does it make you feel, et cetera?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.200]   They're not going to answer,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.600]   at least not with any coherence,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.780]   because they don't have spoken language yet.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.040]   But despite their absence of language,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.300]   we know that babies as young as three months old
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.840]   respond to music because they do so
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.780]   with rhythmic movements of their bodily limbs
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.700]   and actually their torso as well.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.640]   Now, a little bit later, we will touch on this issue
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.980]   of what types of music evoke movement of the torso
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.460]   versus movement of the limbs
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.540]   versus movement of the torso and limbs.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.180]   No, I'm not going to dance for you during this podcast.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.640]   However, there's a really interesting story there
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.260]   that relates to how primitive or evolved
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.600]   the motor neurons,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.520]   the neurons that actually move the musculature are
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.260]   and how primitive or evolved the music
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.900]   that one listens to is.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.680]   But just to give you a sense of where that's headed,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.840]   in this study where they examined the responses
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   of very young babies to music,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.240]   what they found is that certain frequencies of sound
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.060]   evoked movements in those babies that were rhythmic,
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.440]   where it was mostly their torso moving back and forth
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.200]   and maybe their head a little bit,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.920]   whereas other patterns of sound,
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.420]   different frequencies in different arrangements,
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.440]   evoked movement of their limbs more than their torso
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.260]   and still other patterns of sounds
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.560]   evoked movement of their torso, limbs and head.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.740]   In other words, babies dancing.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.800]   And if you've ever been to a wedding or a party
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.180]   or been out dancing,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.220]   you will see people who include more torso versus limb
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.900]   versus limb and torso movement when they dance.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.520]   And yes, of course,
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.880]   some of this relates to proficiency in dancing
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.640]   or comfort on the dance floor, et cetera,
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.520]   but there are some universal rules out there
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.240]   about how certain frequencies and patterns of sound,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.480]   AKA music, evokes different types of bodily movements.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.360]   So starting from a very young age,
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.040]   prior to any instruction in terms of how to dance
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.200]   or what music is, babies are dancing to music.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.540]   And that highlights an important point
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.480]   that we will return to again and again
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.540]   throughout today's episode,
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.280]   which is that the systems of the brain
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   that respond specifically to movement, not just sound,
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.880]   but specifically to musical sounds
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.240]   are intimately tied to the neural circuits of the body
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.440]   that generate movement.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.720]   And this is especially important to understand
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   when we get into our discussion about music
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.400]   and our sense of motivation.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.600]   Okay, so the list of incredible things
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.580]   that music can evoke within us
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.480]   by way of how it activates our nervous system and body
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.760]   is starting to grow.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.640]   We've talked about how music can convey emotion,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.600]   how music can evoke emotion,
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.640]   and how music can convey a sense of intent,
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.420]   as well now as how music can generate action within us.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.520]   This is a pretty spectacular list if you think about it.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.720]   In addition, music causes changes
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.780]   within our bodily physiology
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.480]   that extends beyond the nervous system,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.160]   although it has a relationship to the nervous system.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.300]   In particular, there've been a lot of studies
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.640]   that have explored how music changes things
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.960]   like our blood pressure
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.600]   or how fast our heart is beating,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.720]   our so-called resting heart rate.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.200]   And here we've made some important discoveries
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.040]   in recent years.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.720]   And when I say we, I don't mean my laboratory,
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.460]   I mean laboratories that focus on the relationship
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.100]   between music and our bodily physiology,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.720]   because we've long known
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.340]   that music can change various health metrics.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.720]   There are some really nice studies,
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.600]   and I'll link to one or two of the meta-analyses
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.720]   of these studies in the show note captions,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.960]   that have showed that if people listen
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.400]   to anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes of music per day,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.980]   and by the way, the selection of music in these studies
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.540]   ranged everything from rock and roll,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.100]   to classical music, to country music,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.720]   typically these studies would ask subjects
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.160]   what their favorite music is,
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.400]   and then they would have them listen
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.520]   to that particular genre of music
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.040]   for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes per day.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.500]   And if you look at the meta-analyses of those studies,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.720]   what you find is that almost all of them
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.960]   see some sort of significant effect,
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.560]   that is some statistically significant shift
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.440]   in the bodily physiology of people
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.980]   that deliberately listen to music
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.460]   for 10 to 30 minutes per day.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.660]   Not while doing anything else,
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.560]   but just listening to that music.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.620]   They find, for instance,
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.740]   that their resting heart rate is reduced,
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.480]   if not during the period
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.560]   in which they're listening to the music,
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.880]   then after the time in which they're listening to the music,
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.120]   they find that their so-called heart rate variability
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.280]   tends to increase.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   For those of you that aren't familiar
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.640]   with heart rate variability,
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.440]   having increased heart rate variability is a good thing,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.840]   and that's because heart rate variability
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.640]   reflects the sort of push and pull,
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.080]   or the balance, rather,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.240]   of the activation of the so-called sympathetic nervous system
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.560]   which is the one sometimes called the fight or flight system,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.700]   although I don't really like that nomenclature.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.280]   The sympathetic nervous system,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.840]   by the way, is not about emotional sympathy,
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.600]   it's what drives your heart rate higher,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.840]   it tends to put us into activated states
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.500]   where we favor movement and motion and makes us alert,
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.400]   whereas the parasympathetic aspect of our nervous system
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.880]   is the portion of our autonomic nervous system,
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.680]   sometimes called the rest and digest system,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.160]   the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.800]   drives states of deeper relaxation, of calm.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.320]   In any event, heart rate variability
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.040]   reflects a periodic breaking,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.960]   a slowing down of heart rate and breathing
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.780]   and other aspects of our neural system function
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.160]   that works alongside with sympathetic activation.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.420]   Think of sympathetic activation as an accelerator,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.360]   parasympathetic activation as a break,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.740]   and when heart rate variability is higher,
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.260]   it reflects the fact that our parasympathetic nervous system
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.180]   is periodically engaging, it's getting activated
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.340]   and slowing our heart rate, slowing our breathing down.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.140]   Music seems to have the effect
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.300]   of activating that parasympathetic aspect
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.380]   of our nervous system,
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.940]   and so we are pumping the brake every once in a while,
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.100]   slowing down our heart rate, slowing down our breathing.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.700]   In other words, when people listen to music
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.500]   for a dedicated period of time each day
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.820]   of about 10 to 30 minutes,
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.080]   some studies looked at as much as 60 minutes,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.120]   but typically 10 to 30 minutes,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.720]   what one finds is that heart rate variability increases,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.080]   not just during the period
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.360]   when they're listening to the music, this is very important,
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.780]   but also heart rate variability is increased
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.480]   around the clock in those subjects, even during sleep,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.440]   making listening to 10 to 30 minutes
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.200]   of your favorite music each day,
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.080]   not just what I would think to be a enjoyable protocol,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.320]   if you could even call it a protocol,
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.720]   it's so enjoyable to listen to your favorite music
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.600]   that it feels almost inappropriate to call it a protocol
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.080]   because protocol sounds kind of rigid,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.480]   like you're imposing that on yourself,
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.280]   but if you need an excuse to listen to your favorite music
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.860]   for 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes per day,
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.960]   and just attending to that music,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.200]   not while doing anything else,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.480]   which is what these studies had subjects do,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.800]   well, indeed that's been shown
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.880]   to increase heart rate variability around the clock,
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.920]   which we know is beneficial
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.120]   for your mental and physical health more generally.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.320]   Okay, so there are dozens, if not hundreds of studies
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.400]   that have explored how music impacts our physiology,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.480]   and as I just mentioned,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.880]   it seems that if we listen to music that we like
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.240]   for 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes a day,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.640]   our physiology, certain health metrics,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.300]   heart rate variability in particular, improve.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.720]   Now, in light of the positive effects
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.680]   of listening to music on one's health,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.280]   there's a recent meta-analysis
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.200]   that I found particularly interesting.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.880]   The title of this meta-analysis
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.640]   is effects of music on the cardiovascular system,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.660]   and it was published in "Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine."
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.640]   Now, from the title of this paper,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.920]   "Effects of Music on the Cardiovascular System,"
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.640]   you might think that it's just yet another meta-analysis
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.100]   exploring how music impacts heart rate variability
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.600]   and things of that sort.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.440]   But what's interesting about this study
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.200]   is that it identifies that the way
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.640]   in which listening to one's favorite music
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.900]   positively impacts the cardiovascular system
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.880]   and other aspects of our physiology
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   is very likely not through direct changes on our heart rate
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.140]   simply by listening to music,
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.040]   but rather through changes in our breathing.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.360]   And this is true
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.840]   even if people were not singing along with the music,
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.980]   by the way.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.820]   Now, the relationship between breathing and heart rate
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.400]   is something that I've touched on before,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.200]   but if you haven't heard me discuss this,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.440]   I'm just going to briefly tell you the relationship
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.680]   in two or three sentences,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.240]   and then I'll explain the mechanism
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.720]   also in about two to three sentences.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.140]   So if you have a background in biology,
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.180]   or even if you don't,
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.860]   this will all be very simple and very clear.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.740]   When you deliberately inhale with a lot of vigor,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.440]   or you deliberately make your inhale longer
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.840]   than you naturally would,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.480]   so for instance, if I breathe in very vigorously
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.200]   through my nose,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.180]   something very specific happens to your heart rate,
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.360]   it increases,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.920]   whereas when you deliberately exhale,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.840]   meaning when you exhale
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.240]   and deliberately make that exhale longer,
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.960]   or you deliberately add vigor to that exhale,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.080]   or even a shorter, deliberate, more vigorous exhale,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.200]   you slow down your heart rate.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.520]   And that's because of a phenomenon
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.860]   called respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.260]   which because it includes the word arrhythmia,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.200]   sounds like a bad thing,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   but it's actually a wonderful thing.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.400]   And it has to do with the relationship
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.960]   between a particular muscle in your body
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.620]   called the diaphragm,
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.720]   which when you inhale, our lungs fill with air,
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.040]   our diaphragm moves down,
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.800]   and our heart therefore has a little bit more space.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.460]   It actually gets bigger,
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.640]   temporarily bigger, but bigger.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.880]   And when it does that,
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.080]   whatever volume of blood is in the heart
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.300]   is now moving through a larger space.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.880]   So it's the same amount of blood
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.480]   moving through a larger space,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.400]   and the nervous system registers that
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.380]   as the blood moving more slowly
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.320]   through that temporarily enlarged heart.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.160]   And as a consequence,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.360]   there's a signal sent through various stations
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.280]   of the nervous system to the heart to speed the heart up.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.920]   In other words, just as I said before,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.360]   when we inhale, our heart rate speeds up.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   Conversely, when we exhale, our lungs empty out some air,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   our diaphragm moves up.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.760]   And as a consequence of that,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.200]   there's less space for the heart.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.840]   And so our heart temporarily becomes smaller.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.100]   And when that happens,
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.960]   the volume of blood within that smaller heart
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.520]   moves more quickly.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   And that's detected by the nervous system,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.760]   which then triggers a neural signal
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.080]   from the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.440]   which is just fancy nerd speak
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.320]   for a neural signal is sent to your heart.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.520]   Every time you exhale to slow your heart down.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.080]   So the well-established effects
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.480]   of listening to your favorite music,
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.860]   increasing your heart rate variability
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.300]   is not a direct interaction
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.780]   between the sounds coming in through your ears
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.360]   and changes in your heart rate
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.980]   while you're listening to the music.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.780]   That's actually what I would have thought happened.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.640]   But this more recent meta-analysis
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.800]   pulls apart the variables in these different studies,
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.120]   really illustrates that when we are listening to music,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.680]   we are subconsciously, most of the time subconsciously,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.780]   changing our patterns of breathing.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.080]   We are inhaling an anticipation
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.180]   of certain things happening in the music.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.020]   We're exhaling when we feel a relief of tension.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.580]   We get excited, we may get sad, we may get happy.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.260]   We may even just be listening to music
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.940]   that we don't think is impacting our physiology
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.280]   at such a core level, but indeed it is.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.680]   Music is able to route into our nervous system
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.160]   at levels below our conscious awareness
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.660]   and literally turn the various knobs, if you will,
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.940]   of our cardiovascular system, of our breathing apparatus,
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.200]   the diaphragm, the lungs.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.840]   It can evoke respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.240]   which again, sounds like a terrible thing,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.400]   but is actually the reflection
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.680]   of a healthy nervous system and heart.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.760]   And in doing so, yes, it increases heart rate variability,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.200]   something that is beneficial to all of us,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.640]   but it's doing so by changing our patterns of breathing.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.680]   So if you've ever wondered why music can change
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.640]   how you feel so robustly,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.160]   well, it's doing that at a deep foundational level
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.200]   of your nervous system.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.960]   Indeed, at the levels of your nervous system
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.560]   that typically are not in your conscious awareness,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.120]   because I have to imagine that most of you
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.600]   are probably not listening to music and thinking,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.500]   oh, here comes that one chorus,
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.760]   or here comes that one melody,
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.560]   and this is where I always exhale,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.720]   or this is where I always hold my breath,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.540]   this sort of thing.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.420]   No, most people are just listening to music.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.100]   It's coming in through their ears.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.740]   They're experiencing some bodily sensations.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.240]   Maybe they're moving their torso, arms,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.320]   maybe your arms and torso.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.840]   Maybe you're not moving at all, no dancing.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.620]   Maybe just listening within your head,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.500]   or maybe it's just dropped into the background
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.160]   below your conscious awareness at all,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.460]   and yet that music is communicating emotion.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.560]   It's evoking emotion.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.520]   It's communicating intent.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.200]   It's activating those premotor circuits
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.240]   that would have you move if it could,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.280]   and we'll talk about dance a little bit later,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.680]   but even if you're not dancing,
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.440]   even if you're not swaying the tiniest bit,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   your patterns of breathing are changing,
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.480]   and through respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.280]   your heart rate is changing,
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.560]   and through changes in your heart rate,
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.960]   your heart rate variability is increasing.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.600]   So if ever you wanted a tool or protocol
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.760]   that was easy to use but could positively impact
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.680]   your mental and physical health,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.480]   well, listening to your favorite music
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.080]   for 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes, maybe more per day
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.560]   is that protocol.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.480]   As many of you know,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.160]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.600]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.920]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.760]   that's designed to meet
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.980]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.600]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.900]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.160]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.820]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings,
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.800]   but with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.560]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.720]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.520]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.160]   I have more focus and energy,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.280]   and I sleep better, and it also happens to taste great.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.160]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.840]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.540]   I answer, AG1.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.240]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.700]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.460]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.120]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.960]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.300]   So hopefully it's becoming clear
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.860]   just how absolutely powerful music is
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.180]   at evoking different physiological responses within you,
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.340]   that is within your brain and body.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.180]   But there's an additional one
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.840]   that I find particularly interesting
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.020]   because it addresses and indeed answers
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.660]   one of the most common questions that I receive all the time,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.440]   which is how can I get more motivated?
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.900]   Not how I, Andrew, can get more motivated,
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.020]   although of course I ask myself that question
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.140]   from time to time,
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.100]   although admittedly most of the time I'm wondering
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.060]   how I'm just going to get everything
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.180]   that I need to get done done,
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.000]   but I often get the question,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.480]   how can I feel more motivated
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.060]   or what can I do to sustain my motivation over time?
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.080]   And we hear a lot of different strategies
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.480]   about how to do that.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.540]   We hear about the quote unquote, just do it strategy,
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.740]   the incredible slogan that Nike created
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.060]   and that persists to this day
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.700]   has become commonplace in culture.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.200]   And indeed the just do it form of advice can be a good one,
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.420]   but for a lot of people just hearing just do it
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.260]   or telling themselves just do it
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.700]   is not something that can evoke action in them.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.020]   Other people will listen to motivational speeches,
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.720]   they'll look at motivational videos,
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.060]   they'll read motivational books,
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.780]   they may even hire coaches.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.240]   In other words, people invest a ton of time, energy,
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.060]   and money into trying to be more motivated.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.780]   And indeed a number of episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.020]   have focused on the relationship between say motivation,
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.400]   drive and the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.880]   And we have several episodes about that
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.960]   as well as a toolkit,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.760]   all of which are available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.700]   You can access those easily by putting motivation
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.580]   into the search function at hubermanlab.com.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.140]   All of that will come up timestamped, et cetera.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.680]   But perhaps surprisingly today's conversation about music
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.600]   offers us a particularly potent tool to increase motivation.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.940]   And that's because one of the fundamental properties
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.820]   of listening to music is that it evokes activation
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.200]   of these pre-motor and motor circuits
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.260]   within our brain and body.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.860]   That is the neural circuits whose specific job
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.020]   is to mobilize our body from its current position and state
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.980]   to a new position and state.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.440]   So for those of you that listen to music while you work out
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.100]   or prior to when you work out,
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.340]   you are definitely onto something.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.260]   For those of you that don't, that's fine too.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.580]   What I'm going to describe now
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.760]   are the specific sets of neural circuits
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.160]   that listening to music activates.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.100]   As I mentioned earlier, listening to music
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.480]   activates so many circuits throughout the brain and body
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.540]   that really one can take a step back
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.700]   from the scientific literature on this and say,
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.560]   anytime someone has done a study
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.420]   where human beings listen to music
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.560]   and people record from a particular brain area,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.600]   believe it or not, even from the olfactory system,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.560]   from the system and the brain responsible for smell,
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.920]   there seems to be some significant shift
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.580]   in terms of the neural firing there
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.020]   or the release of neural chemicals,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.140]   which on the one hand might lead you to conclude
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.700]   that listening to music is just sort of a non-specific,
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.140]   generalized activator of nervous system function.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.140]   It's just kind of like turning all the lights on,
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.240]   but that's not the case.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.880]   Music in fact is activating different neural circuits
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.180]   differently in time and space
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.060]   to evoke a whole set of specific reactions
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.340]   in your brain and body,
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.160]   but not the least of which is the propensity for you to move.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.740]   And this is something that you can leverage
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.100]   and indeed I'll describe a protocol
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.640]   by which you can leverage music
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.800]   in order to greatly increase your state of motivation.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.740]   Okay, so this is the portion of today's episode
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.520]   where we're going to discuss some specific neural circuits,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.180]   but I want to assure you that if you're a neurobiologist,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.260]   you can understand this.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.000]   If you are not a neurobiologist,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.860]   in fact, if you took no biology ever in your life,
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.900]   I'm going to make it clear and easy for you to understand.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.580]   As I mentioned before, when we hear music,
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.480]   it activates many, many circuits
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.420]   throughout the brain and body.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.900]   When I say circuits, I mean neurons,
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.860]   nerve cells that communicate with one another
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.980]   and sort of chains of reactions.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.880]   When I say respond to one another,
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.800]   what I mean is when neurons are quote unquote activated,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.660]   they release chemicals.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.060]   Those chemicals are called neurotransmitters,
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.980]   things like glutamate, GABA.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.240]   They're also called neuromodulators,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.200]   things like dopamine, serotonin.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.020]   The names don't really matter for sake of today's discussion,
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.180]   but what those things do is they influence the likelihood
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.600]   that the next neuron will be active or less active, okay?
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.380]   So neurons speak the language, if you will, of electricity,
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.740]   'cause that's how they evoke release of these chemicals
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.000]   and chemistry, they vomit out these chemicals.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.060]   Those chemicals then bind to little parking spots
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.240]   on the next neuron called receptors,
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.220]   and then the next neuron gets activated electrically
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.920]   and then to the next neuron and next neuron and so on.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.620]   It's a chain of electrochemical reactions, okay?
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.120]   So there's your neuroscience 101 lesson for today.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.020]   When people listen to music,
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.940]   there is heightened activation
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.580]   of the so-called frontal cortex, the area of your brain,
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.960]   which is on the surface below your skull,
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.100]   but just behind your forehead, more or less.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.840]   And that area of your brain is involved
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.100]   in a lot of different things.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.200]   It's involved in understanding context,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.380]   what sorts of behaviors and thoughts and actions
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.700]   are appropriate for a given environment.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.820]   By the way, if any of you have ever been in an environment
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.340]   where everyone was really quiet and you thought,
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.820]   oh my gosh, what's keeping me from just blurting out
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.020]   my name right now or saying something totally inappropriate,
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.820]   your frontal cortex is the one providing the shh,
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.700]   the so-called top-down inhibition on that impulse
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.420]   to blurt something inappropriate out.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.260]   And by the way, your thoughts about that impulse
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.420]   are perfectly normal.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.060]   They actually reflect a heightened sense of normalcy
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.880]   because it means that your brain is thinking about
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.840]   how it's not going to do that,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.500]   and so therefore you're not going to do that.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.680]   Likewise, if you are ever at the edge of a high bridge,
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.940]   please stay on the safe side of the railing.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.920]   But if you think, oh my goodness,
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.440]   what's keeping me from just jumping off the bridge right now,
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.520]   what's keeping you from doing that is your frontal cortex.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.620]   It's suppressing certain actions in a context-dependent way,
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.120]   in particular actions that are dangerous to you socially,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.160]   physically, dangerous to others socially,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.880]   physically, et cetera.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.720]   Now, the frontal cortex in order to do that
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.000]   also has an incredible ability to make predictions.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.720]   So this is the function of the frontal cortex
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.600]   that I want to focus on for the moment.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.940]   Your frontal cortex is great at doing the,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.480]   if this, then that type of analysis.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.720]   If I say this, everyone will be offended.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.560]   Or if I say this, maybe they'll laugh.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.760]   Or if I don't say this, I'll be safe.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.460]   If I do say that, I won't be safe, this kind of thing.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.820]   Frontal cortex is activated when we listen to music
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.340]   because within music, there are some regularities.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.560]   Sometimes these are described as motifs
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.700]   or melodies or choruses.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.260]   Again, this is the entire landscape of discussion
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.620]   that we could have and we will have with an expert guest
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.460]   about how the mathematics of music
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.060]   impacts the electrochemical signaling within the brain
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:46.020]   and the coding that is the mathematics of brain function,
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.140]   which leads us to predict that certain things,
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.060]   because they just happened,
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.220]   are likely to happen again or not happen again.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.080]   But let's set all that aside for the moment
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.480]   and just state the simple fact,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.880]   which is that when you listen to music,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.420]   your frontal cortex increases in activation
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.780]   because it is predicting what you're going to hear next
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.520]   based on what you're currently hearing
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.100]   and what you heard before.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.300]   Now, I am from the generation
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.140]   that we didn't have iPods when I was a kid.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.380]   We did have CDs, we did have tapes,
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.060]   but you had to fast forward or rewind a cassette tape,
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.180]   or you had to skip on the CD
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.980]   in order to move about the album in time.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.260]   Nowadays, you can cue up different songs
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.580]   in different order really easily,
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.140]   but if you are somebody who listens
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.580]   to albums start to finish,
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.020]   or if you're like me and you grew up listening
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.620]   to albums start to finish,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.500]   maybe occasionally skipping a song,
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.100]   but you will be very familiar with this phenomenon,
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.380]   which is that right as a given song ends,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.500]   if you're familiar with that album,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   you already anticipate the start
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.060]   of the next song in your head.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.580]   And that just speaks to the predictive function
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.420]   that the frontal cortex plays.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.300]   So if you have a mix tape with a bunch of different songs,
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.860]   sure, you don't expect one song of a given artist
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.020]   to lead into the next,
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.060]   but if you're somebody who's listened
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.100]   to that mix tape a lot,
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.680]   so you're familiar with what song comes next,
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.500]   or if you're listening to a given album start to finish
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.940]   and you're very familiar with it,
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.340]   well, then you'll immediately resonate
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.180]   with what I'm saying here,
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.700]   which is that your frontal cortex is always anticipating
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.960]   what sound is likely to come next.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.220]   And this is very important
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.620]   because one of the key things about music
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.620]   and its ability to evoke our sense of surprise or delight
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.220]   through the release of a neuromodulator called dopamine,
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.940]   we'll get to this a bit more later,
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.540]   is because that prediction machinery is thinking,
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.660]   oh, I heard that set of chords a moment ago,
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.680]   I'm going to hear it again.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.340]   And then when it changes up, your brain goes,
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.040]   oh, whoa, hold on.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.260]   That wasn't what I expected.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.720]   And it sometimes does that with a sense of delight,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.980]   like, oh yes.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.180]   And sometimes it hears that and it goes,
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.180]   oh wait, what's this?
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.380]   I don't really like this that much.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.860]   I like the opener of that song,
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.100]   but I don't really like the rest.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.620]   I think of that as, you know,
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.040]   there's certain pastries, muffins in particular,
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.360]   where I really like the top.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.480]   It's got the little crumbs,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.720]   it's got the berries and stuff,
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.440]   and then you like get down past the top.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.240]   And then you get to the middle of the thing and you're like,
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.340]   oh, well, this thing's not that good.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.980]   Okay, there's certain songs like that for me.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.400]   So I always thought of those as muffin songs
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.480]   because the top of the muffin is always the best.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.420]   Whereas a donut is great the whole way through.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.680]   And now I'm going on a tangent
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.160]   'cause I'm thinking about muffins and donuts.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.780]   So I'm going to take us back to music.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.700]   But the point is relevant nonetheless,
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.940]   which is that your frontal cortex is making predictions.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.840]   And when those predictions are broken,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.880]   that's a sense of novelty.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.700]   And when that novelty is something that you like, okay?
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.900]   So it evokes a sense of, yes, I like that.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.440]   Well, then dopamine is deployed.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.720]   And when that novelty is something you don't like,
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.200]   typically there's a reduction in the amount of dopamine
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.320]   released in a separate set of brain circuits
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.280]   below whatever level of dopamine happened to be there prior,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.640]   your so-called baseline level of dopamine, okay?
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.880]   So when you listen to music,
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.560]   there's a strong activation of the prediction machinery
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.640]   in your brain.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.380]   There's also activation of the circuits in your brain
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.440]   that register novelty.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.760]   What are those circuits?
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.000]   These are things like the ventral tegmental area
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.920]   and the nucleus accumbens.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.960]   I've talked about these before on the podcast.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.480]   Again, you don't need to know those names.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.880]   Those are the names given to certain brain areas
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.040]   that control the release of dopamine in time
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   according to whatever you happen to be experiencing
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.120]   in that moment, okay?
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.600]   So the mesolimbic reward pathway
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.760]   could perhaps better be called
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.280]   the mesolimbic reinforcement pathway.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.600]   So for those of you out there shouting,
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.620]   wait, the mesolimbic pathway does a bunch of other things.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.840]   It's not just dopamine.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.240]   I agree, it's also serotonin.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.080]   It's a bunch of other things.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.400]   But for today's discussion,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.240]   we're thinking about the mesolimbic pathway
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.480]   as deploying dopamine,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.880]   which it does when we hear something novel,
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.840]   meaning not what we predicted and we like what we hear.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.420]   And then there are a bunch of other brain centers
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.920]   and circuits that listening to music activates.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.120]   I'll just list off a few.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.860]   Again, this isn't intended to confuse anybody
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.600]   or add a lot of useless nomenclature,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.620]   but since I am a neuroscientist
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.640]   and this is a science and science-informed tools podcast,
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.080]   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.160]   that we get strong activation of a brain structure.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.000]   You actually have two of them,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.480]   one on each side of the brain called the amygdala.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.020]   This is a brain area that's part of a larger set of circuits
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.840]   that's associated with arousal, okay?
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.940]   Meaning becoming more alert,
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.200]   becoming more aware of our surroundings
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.640]   and the particular sensory stimuli that are coming in
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.920]   at the particular time,
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.320]   such as the notes of the music
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.800]   or a particular set of lyrics.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.700]   And music also activates areas of the brain,
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.160]   such as the parahippocampal formation,
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.220]   the cortex and the hippocampus itself,
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.400]   brain areas that encode and store memories.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.660]   And this is something that I think
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.280]   everyone will be familiar with.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.200]   When you hear certain songs
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.920]   or even songs that sound like certain songs
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.400]   or even songs that you swear you've never heard before,
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.000]   it can evoke a sense of nostalgia,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.680]   of longing for something, of missing somebody,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.120]   of sadness or of delight and happiness
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.080]   and positive memories of somebody or something.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.400]   Indeed, I think it's fair to say
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.780]   that hearing particular pieces of music, particular songs,
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.540]   more than any other experience
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.200]   can activate a whole library of memory
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.260]   and emotions within us.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.240]   And that's because of its ability to activate
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.200]   the parahippocampal regions of the brain,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.160]   the cortex and the hippocampus itself.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.280]   Again, several different brain areas,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.800]   all which communicate with one another
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.260]   and other areas of the brain
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.240]   in order to encode our memories, our sense of self,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.160]   our sense of others,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.880]   our sense of history with those people and on and on.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.920]   Now, rather than just make this
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.760]   a catalog of different brain areas that music evokes,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.680]   what I'm trying to do is spell out
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.080]   how music activating these different brain areas
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.240]   is creating different components
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.820]   of what we are familiar with as our experience of music.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.440]   So frontal cortex prediction,
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.560]   mesolimbic reward pathway, novelty, amygdala,
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.780]   a sense of emotion and arousal.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.920]   Parahippocampal cortex and cortex and hippocampus,
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   our memories, in particular,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.520]   our emotional memories and our location memories
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.480]   associated with a particular piece of music, right?
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.300]   Haven't you ever heard a song from,
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.640]   let's say, a summer camp that you went to
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.480]   when you were a kid?
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.680]   And all of a sudden, you're remembering
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.600]   the smell of the grasses at that summer camp.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.040]   You're remembering how some of the kids were really great
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.800]   and how some of the kids were really obnoxious.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.720]   You're remembering some things that you did.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.680]   You're remembering your counselors.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.120]   I mean, there's just a whole landscape
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.880]   of neural information there,
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.920]   life information stored in your head
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.320]   that hearing a particular song that was sung
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.440]   when you were, what, eight years old, 10 years old,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.600]   that camp just flips the lid on
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.840]   and it comes geysering out.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.080]   Remarkable.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.800]   Now, there are two other sets of brain circuits
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.880]   that are activated by music
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.480]   that deserve specific attention
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.840]   and deserve that specific attention now
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   in the context of discussing motivation
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.100]   and music's ability to motivate us in particular ways.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.880]   And those brain circuits are the basal ganglia, okay?
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.280]   So this is a set of circuits within the brain
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.820]   that are associated with action initiation,
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.240]   so-called go circuits,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.000]   and withholding action, so-called no-go circuits.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.840]   But basically the basal ganglia
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.480]   are involved in regulating movement.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.200]   And the cerebellum.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.080]   The cerebellum is sometimes referred to as the mini brain.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.300]   It looks like a little mini brain
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.880]   in the bottom back of the human brain.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   In some species, the cerebellum is much larger
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.960]   relative to the rest of the brain,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.920]   but in humans, it's like this little piece in the back
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.040]   that looks like a little mini brain,
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.360]   like you're carrying a second brain back there.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.320]   That's why I call it mini brain, cerebellum.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.960]   It's involved in a lot of things,
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.820]   but one of its primary functions
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.800]   is to encode rhythmic timing and processing.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.840]   And along with its outputs to some deeper brainstem areas,
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.580]   things like the vestibular and cochlear nuclei,
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.400]   we'll talk about this, the parabrachial nucleus.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.000]   Again, you don't need to know these names.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.380]   It, meaning the cerebellum, along with the basal ganglia,
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.040]   creates patterns of activity in our brain
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.080]   that cascade down to particular circuits in our body.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.660]   So these are so-called pre-motor circuits and motor circuits
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.520]   that generate the sense that we not only can move,
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.820]   but that we want to move
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.300]   and that we want to move in particular ways.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.660]   So if you internalize nothing from the last five minutes
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.060]   or so in which I've been describing
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.580]   how music impacts different neural circuits in the brain,
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.120]   please do take away this important point,
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.580]   which is that when we listen to music,
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.580]   we think of that as an auditory experience,
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.920]   but now you know that it's also an emotional experience.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.360]   And, and this is a very important and,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.100]   when we listen to music,
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.840]   it is programming a specific set of motor actions
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.880]   that are more likely to occur.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.960]   Put differently, when we listen to music,
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.680]   we are more likely to move our body and not just dance,
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.920]   not just move our torso, our limbs,
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.820]   or our limbs and torso together in concert with the music,
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.800]   but rather move our body from its current position
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.180]   to another position.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.920]   And this is one of the most important things
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.420]   to understand about music.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.980]   Music, despite being an auditory stimulus
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.520]   coming in through our ears,
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.640]   evokes the activation of neural circuits in our brain
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.560]   that creates a sort of inertia.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.520]   It creates a propensity for action across our entire body.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.440]   So now that you understand that listening to music
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.160]   activates lots of different brain circuits,
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.740]   of course, the circuits that respond to auditory stimuli,
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.400]   so-called primary auditory cortex,
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.720]   is powerfully activated by listening to music,
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.340]   but also circuits associated with novelty, anticipation.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.280]   We talked about circuits in the brain associated with memory,
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.400]   but also circuits in the brain
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.120]   that are associated with generating movement,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.440]   and not just movement that is in sync with
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.440]   or corresponds to the music that we're listening to,
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.040]   but all forms of movement.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.100]   But when we listen to music
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.840]   that has a relatively fast cadence,
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.400]   and we can actually define what that cadence needs to be,
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.200]   and we'll do that in a moment,
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.000]   when we do that, so-called premotor circuitry,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.720]   the circuitry that's going to initiate
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.580]   that kind of inertia or that pressure for movement
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.240]   within the neural circuits that actually evoke movement,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.140]   are all activated.
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.200]   So for those of you that like to listen to music
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.800]   while you exercise,
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.300]   you're familiar with the fact that
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.380]   listening to great songs with a great beat,
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.620]   with particular lyrics,
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.260]   or that associate you with a particular time
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.280]   or place in your life can be very motivating.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.980]   But there are data showing that when people listen to music
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.640]   that's faster than about 140 to 150 beats per minute,
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.480]   that it creates a heightened state of motivation
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.760]   in the body to move.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.460]   And the way that it does that
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.160]   is by way of shifting the balance
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.540]   between those go circuits and no-go circuits
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.380]   of the basal ganglia.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.020]   There's some other ways that it does it as well.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.040]   For instance, music can evoke the release
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.760]   of certain neurochemicals called the catecholamines.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.720]   These include dopamine,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.600]   but also norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.240]   from centers in the brain and body,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   glands in the body like the adrenal gland,
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.340]   that shift the body toward a predisposition
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.980]   of being more likely to move.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.480]   So if we want to distill all this out
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.420]   to a simple actionable takeaway, simply know this.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.520]   Listening to music, relatively faster music,
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.560]   predisposes you to be more motivated to move.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.220]   And that is independent, is what I find so cool.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.080]   It's independent of whether or not
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.140]   you're familiar with the song,
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.440]   independent of whether or not the lyrics of the song
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.080]   are motivating lyrics.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.120]   If they are, that's just going to layer on top
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.640]   of the faster cadence,
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.680]   which is going to predispose you to move.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.400]   But what's remarkable is that just listening
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.480]   to that faster cadence music
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.000]   is creating a neuronal resonance, if you will,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.240]   a pattern of neuronal firing within you
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.440]   that is going to essentially take your,
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.540]   and here I'm using metaphor,
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.240]   is going to put your state of motivation
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.400]   from either back on your heels to being flat-footed,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   or let's say you're mildly motivated,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.560]   so I'll call that flat-footed,
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.420]   to being forward center of mass.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.920]   So for any of you that are suffering
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.720]   from lack of motivation in particular to exercise,
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.080]   but believe it or not, also to do cognitive work
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.360]   where you're going to be still
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.600]   and you're going to sit down and you're going to read
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.360]   or learn or practice something,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.460]   listening to music for 10 to 15 minutes
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.320]   prior to doing that work, prior to doing that exercise,
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   is one of the best ways to get motivated
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.000]   in order to engage in that work or engage in that exercise.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.300]   That's been demonstrated in the data very conclusively
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.380]   using a variety of different types of music.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.380]   And again, there are multiple mechanisms
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.660]   that converge to create that heightened state of motivation.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.520]   Some of those mechanisms are neurochemical,
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.320]   like the release of the so-called catecholamines,
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.180]   dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.000]   Some of them are strictly neural circuit-based,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.120]   so activation of premotor circuitry,
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.360]   and those are going to combine with neural circuits
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.520]   that are going to narrow your field of vision.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.720]   This is a good thing whenever you want to be motivated.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.840]   They're going to literally constrict your field of vision
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.240]   to more of a tunnel type of vision
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.040]   as opposed to more panoramic vision.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.540]   And that I described it as placing you
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.120]   into a forward center of mass.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.720]   I don't necessarily mean literally a forward center of mass,
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.880]   unless perhaps you're exercising,
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.320]   like running, leaning slightly forward.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.840]   What I'm talking about is using music
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.320]   as a way to deliberately shift your state of mind and body
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.500]   from one that is amotivated, not motivated,
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.520]   to more motivated.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.420]   And it's a very simple protocol
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.360]   extracted from the peer-reviewed literature.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.300]   You simply find some faster music,
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.380]   hopefully music that you like.
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.840]   It would be even better if it was music that had lyrics
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.360]   that you find motivating,
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.840]   and listening to that for 10 to 15 minutes
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.340]   prior to engaging in whatever that work may be,
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.040]   physical or cognitive.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.540]   On the topic of cognitive work,
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.980]   one of the most common questions I get is,
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.380]   what sorts of sounds or music should I listen to
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:00.560]   in order to increase my state of productivity,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.240]   motivation, concentration, et cetera?
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.440]   On previous podcasts related to focus and motivation,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.000]   I touched on the use of so-called binaural beats,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.220]   which are different frequencies of beats
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.980]   presented to one or the other ear.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.980]   This is best accomplished with headphones.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.640]   And there are a lot of different frequencies
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.100]   of binaural beats that you can get out there.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.500]   If you want to get detailed about this,
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.120]   binaural beats also involve the differential
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.200]   between the frequency of beats
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.780]   between the two, presented to the two ears.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.080]   And then that difference then is heard
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.300]   by higher order processing centers in the brain.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.640]   In any event, we don't have to get too technical about it.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.260]   We can simply say that,
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:41.100]   yes, there are some decent peer reviewed studies
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.540]   demonstrating that when people listen to so-called 40 Hertz,
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.980]   it's a particular frequency of sound,
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.860]   40 Hertz binaural beats,
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.060]   that it can enhance concentration and focus.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.860]   However, and this is important,
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.860]   there are some recent studies that show that binaural beats
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.220]   sometimes can impede concentration and focus
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.820]   and thereby can impede cognitive performance
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.220]   on various tasks.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.300]   However, the studies that show that binaural beats
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:09.060]   can be detrimental to performance on various cognitive tasks
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.960]   did not use 40 Hertz binaural beats specifically.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.720]   So we are still awaiting more studies on binaural beats.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.820]   Meanwhile, I'll just restate what I said before
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.520]   is that there is some evidence
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.240]   that listening to 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.520]   can enhance concentration and focus.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.760]   There are also data showing that other frequencies
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.160]   of binaural beats might be detrimental to concentration
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.700]   and cognitive performance.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.220]   And previously, I've also discussed studies showing
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.560]   that, for instance, if people listen to white noise
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.400]   in the background,
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.140]   you can do this on your computer or speakers in the room
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.040]   or headphones or so-called brown noise,
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.800]   which is essentially like white noise,
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.680]   shh, all frequencies of sound
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.880]   or most frequencies of sound combined,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.680]   but with particular frequencies of sounds
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.860]   that are accentuated and others are notched out
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.940]   as it's called, so-called brown noise.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.080]   Rather than understand all of this at a technical level,
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.440]   'cause I've covered that before in previous podcasts,
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.060]   suffice to say, if you go to YouTube
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.440]   and you just put in white noise background
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   for cognitive focus
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.640]   or brown noise background for cognitive focus,
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.520]   you can just try those if you like during a session
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.060]   in which you're trying to read or learn
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.720]   or do mathematics or music or any kind of cognitive work.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.560]   If you don't like them, if they don't work for you,
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.660]   then there's certainly no obligation to use them.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.040]   Likewise with 40 Hertz binaural beats.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.960]   And for binaural beats,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.800]   you can also find those as zero-cost YouTube scripts.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.600]   There are a number of zero-cost apps
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.960]   that will allow you to listen to binaural beats.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:29.200]   I've used the app Brainwave for some period of time now.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.040]   To be honest,
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.280]   I've done this strict control experiment on myself
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.160]   of listening to the 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.880]   or not listening to 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.560]   doing the equivalent types of tasks.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.240]   I can be fairly regimented with my work and behavior,
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.180]   but I haven't run a detailed controlled study
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.460]   on myself around this.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.620]   Rather, if I want to heighten my level of focus
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.720]   or rule out distractions,
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.360]   what I will do is I will listen to either white noise
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.840]   or brown noise while I do work,
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.340]   or I will listen to 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.480]   while I do certain types of work.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.280]   Or sometimes, frankly, I just work in silence.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.740]   Other times, I will listen to classical music
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.580]   in the background.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.160]   I'm a big fan of listening to classical piano.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.960]   I particularly like Glenn Gould, the Bach variations.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.380]   Those are very pleasant to me.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.160]   But, and this is really important,
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.680]   in researching this episode about music and the brain,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.020]   what I discovered was in the controlled studies
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:20.860]   that have been carried out
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.280]   as to whether or not people perform better
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.400]   on cognitive tasks that require a lot of focus,
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.040]   especially learning tasks that compared silence
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.520]   in the background to purely instrumental music
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.100]   in the background, to music with lyrics in the background,
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:39.320]   to one's favorite music with or without lyrics,
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.800]   the data are very clear.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.440]   It's very clear that most people,
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.280]   that means statistically on average,
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.740]   people perform best on cognitive tasks
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.000]   or tasks that require a lot of focus to perform.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.580]   Again, these are mental tasks, not physical tasks.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:59.120]   When they are doing those tasks in complete silence.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.940]   So that was somewhat surprising to me.
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:05.700]   Second best conditions are to do those tasks
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.920]   in the presence of instrumental music only.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.800]   And in that case, there was a lot of variation
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.720]   as to whether or not people preferred faster cadence music.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.100]   So 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster,
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.980]   or slower music, 60 beats per minute or slower.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.940]   I'll get back to those specific numbers later
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.660]   because they represent thresholds for inducing
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.240]   different types of emotional states, either happy or sad.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.760]   But meanwhile, it's very clear when people work in silence,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.360]   they perform better than when they work
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.440]   with music instrumentals in the background.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.200]   And they perform even less well when they listen to music
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.080]   with lyrics in the background.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.440]   We'll talk about why that is the case in a moment.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.000]   And then people perform especially poorly
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.500]   relative to their performance in silence
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.240]   or any of the other conditions I mentioned
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.320]   when they listen to their favorite music
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.000]   while doing cognitive work.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.360]   And that to me was a bit surprising,
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.140]   especially since I spent a lot of my university years
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.680]   studying while listening to my favorite music
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.520]   in different forms.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.120]   I'd listen to slower music than faster music
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.120]   and go back and forth.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.780]   And then sometimes turn it off altogether
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.720]   and work in silence.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.320]   But the center of mass of the literature around this issue
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.500]   of whether or not to listen to music while one studies
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.400]   or tries to learn something, the data are pretty clear.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.780]   The data show that it's best to study and learn
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.000]   either in silence or with quiet instrumentals
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   in the background.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.620]   Now, I mentioned before that previous studies compared
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.260]   the effects of working in silence versus working
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:33.360]   with 40 Hertz binaural beats or white noise or brown noise
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.200]   in the background.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.860]   And in those studies, it was found that the white noise,
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.600]   brown noise and 40 Hertz binaural beats background
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.440]   produced better levels of focus.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.280]   I should say heightened levels of focus
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.880]   and cognitive performance and learning
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.040]   then working in silence.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.440]   But I've not yet seen a study that compared 40 Hertz
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.440]   binaural beats, brown noise, white noise to music directly.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.960]   Perhaps there's one out there.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.120]   If there is, please send it to me.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.380]   I'd be very curious to learn what the results of those are.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.980]   Now that might seem like a lot of information,
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.960]   but the takeaways from it are very clear.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.840]   And it's always nice when things are clear, right?
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.120]   It's clear that if we want to focus and learn
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.760]   that working in silence or with white noise or brown noise
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.360]   or 40 Hertz binaural beats is going to be preferable
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.860]   to working while listening to music.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.520]   But if you're going to listen to music while you work,
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.200]   that is do cognitive work,
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.840]   then you're going to want to listen to music
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.060]   that is purely instrumental.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.500]   And ideally the music would be somewhat faster
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.680]   than 140 to 150 beats per minute.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.820]   Now, I do not expect you to go and measure the frequency
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.200]   of beats per minute in the music that you listen to.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.560]   And of course the beats per minute are going to change,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.160]   right, that's an average 140 to 150 beats per minute.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.000]   I don't expect you to get super technical,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.480]   break down the music that you're listening to.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.180]   That is not my goal,
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.940]   nor is that really what this podcast is about.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.640]   I think occasionally people think that, you know,
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.560]   the goal of a science and science-based protocols podcast
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.800]   is to optimize everything.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.920]   In fact, I'm not such a fan of the word optimize
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.280]   because optimal really depends on the situation
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.400]   that you happen to be in.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.180]   The point here is simply this,
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.200]   that many people out there, including myself,
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.980]   have been listening to some of our favorite music
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.320]   while working, but it's very clear as to why
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.140]   that degrades cognitive performance.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.000]   We know, for instance, that when we read,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.520]   we are creating a semantic narrative in our own head.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.080]   And when we listen to music with lyrics,
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.020]   especially music with lyrics that we recognize,
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:30.080]   the semantic content of the song, the lyrics,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.100]   competes with our comprehension of the narrative
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.860]   within our head from the material
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:36.320]   that we're supposed to be learning.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.760]   So now it should be sort of obvious
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.560]   why listening to your favorite music that includes lyrics
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.800]   while trying to learn something else
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.240]   is going to impede learning.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.460]   It's because you've got multiple scripts,
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.960]   multiple dialogues happening in your head.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.760]   And in fact, this is an opportunity for me
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.580]   to take a slight tangent, but a relevant one,
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.400]   which is to say a lot of times people will ask me
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.660]   how I can retain a lot of information.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.360]   I confess I never use a teleprompter for podcasting.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.200]   I do have usually a short stack of notes,
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.860]   anywhere from one to six or seven pages
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.480]   of just bullet pointed notes that cue up things
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.800]   that I want to talk about
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.440]   and that I have researched in the literature.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.820]   And then of course I'll refer to papers from time to time.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.720]   But one of the things that's been very useful for me,
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.800]   which was taught to me, by the way,
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.760]   by a professor when I was in university
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:24.360]   to read and retain information that I've read by memory
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.160]   is that when I read, I'm trying to listen
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.660]   to the words being spoken in my head,
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:31.800]   typically in my own voice,
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.840]   although sometimes in someone else's voice,
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.640]   it doesn't really matter, I find.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.080]   So when I'm reading, yes, it's a process of visual scanning,
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.600]   but I'm also listening to the words within my head
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.920]   as if they're being spoken.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.940]   Some of you may be familiar with this because you do it,
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.240]   others of you perhaps might find this a bit more foreign.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.360]   I'd be curious to know what your process of reading
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.900]   and retaining that information is,
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.520]   whether or not it includes an internal dialogue.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.060]   But nonetheless, it should be very straightforward now
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:59.780]   to see why if you're listening to words
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.480]   that you're reading on a page,
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.840]   maybe even mumbling them a little bit,
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.520]   moving your lips a little bit while you read,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.960]   which by the way, if you heard our episode
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.320]   on language and auditory processing with Dr. Eddie Chang,
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.720]   who's chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.680]   he talked about the fact that when we read any material,
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.160]   that the brain is generating pre-motor activity,
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.620]   you now know what pre-motor activity is,
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.440]   pre-motor activity down to the muscles of the throat,
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.880]   larynx and pharynx, which would speak those words
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.600]   were those signals to get above a certain level,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.720]   but that when we read typically,
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.360]   the signals that are getting sent
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.500]   through those pre-motor circuits
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.360]   are just below the threshold of what would have us
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.120]   actually speak those words.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.920]   Put simply, when we read,
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.620]   we are just shy of saying what we are reading.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.220]   And so when I say that when I read,
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.240]   I'm listening to the words in my head,
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.580]   that's what I'm referring to.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.380]   So we're starting to funnel in on some general principles
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.380]   of music and how it impacts the brain
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.660]   and how that can be leveraged toward better learning
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.280]   and better motivation,
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.140]   both in the context of physical and cognitive endeavors.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.280]   Okay, so if you want to get motivated listening to music
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.680]   prior to doing something
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.500]   that you're trying to motivate to do is a good idea.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.520]   That's what the data say.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.860]   If you're trying to learn something that's cognitive,
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.720]   that requires reading, focus and concentration,
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.260]   silence, 40 Hertz binaural beats,
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.680]   white noise or brown noise is probably best.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.720]   And if you are going to listen to music,
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.640]   listening to music that includes instrumentals,
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.480]   but not lyrics would be best.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.260]   And listening to music that includes lyrics
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.160]   that you're very familiar with would be the worst condition.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.060]   Now, with that said, there are nice studies.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.180]   And by the way, I'm going to link to a number of reviews
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.020]   and primary studies in the show note captions
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.260]   that refer back to this point I'm about to tell you,
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.620]   which is that listening to music
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.300]   while trying to do cognitive tasks
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.000]   can be detrimental toward learning that material.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.880]   Turns out that if you listen to music
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.300]   in the breaks between trying to learn certain material,
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.120]   you can actually heighten your level of cognition
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.060]   and focus and your ability to learn.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.600]   So I find this particularly cool.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.920]   It's not that music is bad
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.860]   for focusing cognition and learning.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.400]   It's that listening to music,
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.420]   especially music that you're familiar with
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.200]   that includes lyrics at the same time
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.560]   as trying to learn something else is not a good idea.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.680]   But listening to music with lyrics,
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.220]   especially music with lyrics that you're familiar with
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.360]   that you find particularly uplifting and motivating
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.640]   is a cognitive and performance enhancer
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.060]   when you go back to doing that work in silence
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.820]   or perhaps while listening to white noise,
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.140]   brown noise or 40 Hertz binaural beats.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.460]   So like so many things, the answer is not black and white.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.060]   It's not that silence is better than music
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.940]   or that music is bad for learning.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.220]   It turns out that listening to music,
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.160]   even music with lyrics you're very familiar with
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.460]   can be highly beneficial for learning,
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:52.940]   but that you want to listen to that music
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.420]   in the breaks between these bouts of cognitive work.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.100]   Now I've done previous podcasts that talk about
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.620]   how long a bout of cognitive work can or should be.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.860]   Typically 90 minutes is going to be the upper limit
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.820]   before you take a break.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.860]   Some people can't work for 90 minutes without a break.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.660]   And by the way, folks, when I say without a break,
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.220]   I don't mean remaining in a deep trench of focus
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.060]   for 90 minutes.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.620]   Nobody does that.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.000]   Actually, I suppose there are a few folks
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.700]   that with neurochemical assistance
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.620]   or just by way of training can get themselves
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.680]   into a deep, deep trench of focus for 90 minutes or more.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.460]   But most people are going to focus on something
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.180]   and then have their attention flip out of focus.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.220]   And then they're going to have to draw their focus back
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.100]   to whatever it is they're doing.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:33.940]   That's not just typical.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.900]   That's absolutely normal and you shouldn't be concerned
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.780]   at all if you try and focus for three minutes
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.740]   and find your attention jumping around
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.460]   two or three times during that attempt.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.520]   But if you're somebody who is going to do say a 90 minute
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.940]   or even 60 minute or even 30 minute bout of work
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.100]   and you are going to get up for a moment
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.940]   and use the restroom or you're going to take a break
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.040]   in between bouts of work.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.360]   So maybe you work for 30 minutes,
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.700]   take 10 minutes or five minutes off or 90 minutes,
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.220]   take 30 minutes off, listening to music in those breaks,
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:07.380]   it seems can increase our ability to focus
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.780]   and to learn new material once we return
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.980]   to those bouts of cognitive focus.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.780]   Now, when it comes to physical exertion,
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.260]   cardiovascular exercise, resistance training of any kind,
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.980]   many people including myself like to listen to music
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.300]   while performing that physical exercise
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.100]   or that physical exertion.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.460]   The data on whether or not music improve
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.340]   physical performance is a bit mixed.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.980]   Certainly you can find studies that show
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.060]   that it improves physical output.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.920]   Other studies will say that it doesn't make a difference.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.140]   Other studies will say that it reduces physical output.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.060]   However, this is a very important however,
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:49.180]   the type of physical exercise is not very well matched
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.740]   between those different studies.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.060]   So this is something that I believe
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.380]   is going to be highly individual.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.540]   In accordance with the published data, I mix it up.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.620]   There are times when I will head out for a run
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.820]   or I will do a resistance training session
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.040]   and I will listen to music,
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.640]   usually an album all the way through
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.500]   or a playlist all the way through.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.720]   And that's because I don't want to be going
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.820]   onto my phone very often.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:10.740]   In fact, these days I use an older separate phone
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.460]   that doesn't have any text messaging
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.020]   or communication to the outside world,
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.980]   but it has music loaded into it or onto it
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.380]   that allows me to just listen to music
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.140]   so that I don't run the risk of getting distracted texting
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.020]   and doing things like that.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.780]   I just want to focus on my physical exercise.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.140]   I should say that phone also has audio books,
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.740]   podcasts, things I've downloaded to it.
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:33.120]   So it's a place where I can listen to things,
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.480]   but not communicate with the outside world,
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.980]   at least while exercising.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.960]   Some people do very well to listen to music,
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.180]   literally in between and during their sets
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.140]   of resistance training throughout their entire runs.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.340]   It's going to be individual.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.800]   You have to figure out what's best for you.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.500]   However, one of the most interesting things
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.300]   about the scientific literature on this
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.180]   shows that if people listen to music,
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:57.620]   in particular music that tends to be faster, more upbeat,
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.340]   typically it's going to be in these studies,
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.460]   rock and roll music, as opposed to classical,
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.900]   although there are some studies that have explored classical
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.680]   and other forms of music as it relates to exercise,
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.940]   listening to that music in between bouts of exertion,
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.060]   so in the rest between sets of resistance training,
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:19.060]   or periodically during say a run or a bout of cycling,
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:23.100]   can indeed enhance performance in a way
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.200]   that at least by my read of the data exceeds
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.640]   that which is observed
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.360]   when people just listen to music throughout.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.660]   In other words, if you find it useful to listen to music
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.400]   before, during and after your workouts, great, be my guest.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.060]   However, what the data say is that switching up
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.060]   between silence and listening to music,
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.680]   and in this case, it would be listening to music
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.780]   that you're very familiar with
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.660]   and that can evoke a sense of motivation
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.100]   and desired action in you for whatever reason,
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:53.300]   the music, the beat, the memories that it draws you to, et cetera.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.780]   Well, then that's going to be useful.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.540]   So there really isn't one protocol
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.380]   for how to get the most out of music
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.060]   for sake of physical exertion,
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.460]   but if you're interested in playing
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.700]   with some of these variables
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.420]   as they've been examined within the peer reviewed literature,
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:09.180]   I find it interesting and indeed I found it useful
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.780]   to, for instance, do a workout where I only listen to music
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.940]   in between sets of resistance training,
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.460]   or to listen to music prior to going out for a run,
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.060]   and then oftentimes when I do that,
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.500]   the song or songs will be sort of on loop in my head.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.660]   Although I confess that a lot of times nowadays,
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.940]   I listen to podcasts while I run or while I hike,
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.580]   and when I'm in the gym and I'm doing resistance training,
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.620]   I like to listen to music as opposed to content
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.680]   that requires that I really focus very heavily
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.780]   on that content, such as a podcast, such as a book.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.900]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.600]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.980]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.460]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.000]   to help you better understand your body
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.900]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.220]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.540]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.760]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.340]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.380]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:03.260]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.420]   about hormones and so on,
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.420]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.720]   With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.500]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.400]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.380]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.560]   and behavioral, supplement, nutrition, and other protocols
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.360]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.620]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.920]   Inside Tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.140]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.780]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.360]   and energy regulation.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.800]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.440]   Now I'd like to talk about the use of music
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.540]   to shift our mood and indeed,
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.020]   to get us out of states of anxiety.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.180]   This is a really interesting scientific literature
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.760]   with some very specific actionable takeaways
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.900]   that I think everyone will find beneficial.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.540]   I certainly did.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.340]   However, I want to point out
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:03.780]   that we don't need a scientific study to illustrate for us
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:05.660]   the way that music can shift our mood.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:09.260]   And you already know why it is that listening to a sad song
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.660]   can sometimes make us feel sad.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.180]   Listening to happy music can make us feel happy.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.020]   It's because when we listen to music,
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.540]   there are some fundamental components of that music,
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.980]   literally the mathematical structure of that music,
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.460]   including the frequency of sounds,
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.340]   the cadence of those sounds, as well as the lyrics,
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.500]   but even in the absence of lyrics
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.220]   that are activating brain circuits within us
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.420]   such that the frequencies of sound that we're hearing
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.260]   are evoking firing of neurons in the brain
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.300]   of the same frequency.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.440]   In other words, your brain becomes a bit of a piano
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.120]   playing the same song that you're hearing inside your head.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.820]   Now that's sort of a duh, right?
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.020]   You hear music in your head,
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.220]   even if you're listening to it from outside in the room.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.740]   But when you understand that neurons speak the language
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.160]   of electrochemical communication,
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.560]   what we're talking about here is particular music
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.460]   evoking the release of neurochemicals in your brain
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.300]   at a particular frequency.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.220]   So just think about that for a second.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.900]   We know that neurochemicals such as dopamine, serotonin,
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.320]   some of the so-called endogenous opioids, right?
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.860]   These aren't opioids that people take.
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.540]   This isn't related to the opioid crisis.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:20.440]   We're talking about endogenous opioids
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.020]   that are released in response to music,
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.180]   things like exercise,
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.180]   different types of social interactions.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.820]   Those and other chemicals are released
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.860]   according to the firing of specific neurons.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.980]   And we know that when you listen to music
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.180]   at particular frequencies
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.740]   arranged in particular motifs, et cetera,
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.060]   that the neurons that release those neurochemicals
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.180]   are firing at those same frequencies.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.420]   In other words, that the sound is causing
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:50.420]   a sound-dependent pharmacologic concert within your brain.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.060]   So that fact should make it incredibly clear
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.220]   as to why certain music, even in the absence of lyrics,
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.260]   can evoke certain emotional states.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.440]   Certain sound frequencies are transformed
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.760]   into the neural language within your brain
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.020]   that releases certain neurochemicals
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:09.200]   that create certain emotional states of brain and body.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.260]   Just to drill in how incredible that really is
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.920]   a little bit further,
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.820]   if you see a beautiful painting
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:20.380]   or the picture or presence of somebody's face in real life
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.740]   that evokes a particularly strong positive
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.620]   or negative emotion,
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.640]   you can imagine that, of course,
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.900]   it creates the release of certain neurochemicals,
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.900]   or perhaps in the case of a negative face,
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.380]   suppresses the release of certain neurochemicals.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.620]   But we can't say that a particular frequency of color,
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.720]   say reds against oranges or the presence of a rainbow,
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.720]   evokes a sort of rainbow-like cascade of neurochemicals,
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.700]   whereas with sound, that's exactly what's happening.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.340]   And this isn't to diminish the value of vision
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.300]   in terms of its ability to evoke emotional states within us.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.380]   After all, I'm foremost a neuroscientist,
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.040]   but under the umbrella of neuroscientists,
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.280]   I started off as, and I continue to be,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.580]   a vision neuroscientist studying the visual system
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.840]   and its ability to evoke emotional states within us.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.860]   But I have to acknowledge that the auditory system,
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.700]   and in particular, the circuits in the brain
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.940]   that respond to music,
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.480]   have a remarkably potent ability
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.400]   to evoke these emotional states,
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.540]   which is why when surveys have been done
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.920]   asking people why they listen to music,
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.860]   the responses that have come back
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:29.060]   generally resemble the following statistics.
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.660]   Approximately 90% of people
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.940]   say they listen to music to relax.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.980]   Approximately 82% of people
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.560]   self-report that they listen to music
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.320]   in order to make themselves happy.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.500]   Approximately 46.5% of people
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.020]   say that they listen to music
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:49.360]   in order to process particular states of emotion.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.720]   We'll get back to what process means in a moment,
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.400]   but more often than not,
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.060]   when these studies have asked specific questions
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.380]   about what particular types of emotions
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:58.360]   people are listening to
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.200]   in order to process their emotions better,
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.140]   it is the emotion of sadness.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:08.960]   And 32.5% of people report that they listen to music
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.740]   in order to increase their sense of concentration,
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.040]   and we already talked about the role of music
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.720]   in concentration or its ability, in some cases,
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.700]   to inhibit concentration a few minutes ago.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.880]   Now, you might be asking yourself,
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.700]   how can 90% of people listen to music for one thing
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.000]   and 82% of people for another thing, and so on and so forth,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.340]   we're well over 100% of people.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.600]   Well, in this survey and other surveys like it,
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.980]   people had the option to give multiple reasons
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.620]   for listening to music because, of course,
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:38.420]   most people have multiple reasons for listening to music.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.000]   Now, with that said,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.820]   if we are to examine this one particular category,
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.680]   nearly half of people who report listening to music
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.320]   on a regular basis listen to music
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.360]   in order to process their emotions,
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.620]   we can ask, what does the scientific literature tell us
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.200]   about how certain types of music
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.060]   evoke certain types of emotions
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.220]   or help us process certain emotions?
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.280]   Again, we'll get back to what we mean
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.300]   by process in a moment,
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.900]   but a number of studies have been done on this.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.060]   There's some meta-analyses
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.840]   that converge on some general themes,
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.040]   what I refer to as the center of mass of data, right?
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.120]   When there are a lot of studies in a given area,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.440]   the outcomes of some of those studies
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.060]   conflict with one another.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.660]   Generally, in a good meta-analysis,
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.520]   what happens is different studies
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.360]   are considered more powerful or less powerful than others,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.620]   depending on how many subjects were involved,
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.800]   the different control conditions
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.180]   or lack of control conditions, and so on and so forth.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.200]   This is one of the great values of meta-analyses
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.540]   is that they don't treat all studies equally.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.880]   They separate out studies
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.320]   based on their level of rigor and thoroughness.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.800]   Well, what we can say with confidence
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.500]   is that music that makes us quote-unquote happy
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.340]   or tends to shift people's state from less happy to happier,
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.620]   regardless of how they entered the experiment,
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:57.100]   tends to be faster music, meaning music that on average
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.100]   contains 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster, okay?
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.540]   And there are some other features
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.980]   to quote-unquote happy music, if you will,
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.180]   that it tends to be in a major key,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.060]   that if there are lyrics to that music,
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.080]   that the lyrics tend to report things that are happy
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.060]   or get this, total nonsense.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.840]   In fact, when the type of lyrics in this quote-unquote
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.380]   happy music's, I guess, singing about great events
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.020]   in life and positive things,
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.280]   falling in love, being in love, positive memories,
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.840]   birth of children, connection to friends, great adventures,
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.980]   those lyrics, or I should say that music
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.340]   containing those lyrics was no more effective
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.920]   in creating states of happiness
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.300]   than was music of equivalent cadence.
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.900]   So again, music that was 140 to 150 beats per minute
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.300]   or faster on average.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.900]   Well, even if the lyrics were complete nonsense,
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.260]   even if the vocalizations weren't actual words,
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.780]   it still evoked the same increase in the level of happiness
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.640]   in the subjects than when compared to the music
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.540]   containing coherent lyrics around happy events.
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:09.680]   What this means is that the cadence of music
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.020]   is no doubt the critical variable
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.180]   when one is trying to shift one's mood
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.280]   from a state of whatever, could be depressed or sad
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.780]   to non-depressed, non-sad, or neutral to positive
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.440]   and so on and so forth.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.560]   But what this also explains is one-hit wonders.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.740]   Rarely, if ever, by the way,
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.440]   are one-hit wonders sad and depressing songs.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.120]   Sometimes, almost always, these one-hit wonders
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.100]   are songs that are very effective in shifting people's mood
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.660]   from not so happy to happier, or we could just say happier,
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.340]   regardless of where they started out
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.400]   before listening to the song.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.960]   They feel better while and after listening to the song.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.380]   And indeed, more often than not,
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.300]   the lyrical content of those songs
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.860]   is not particularly meaningful.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.980]   It's not addressing a particularly meaningful state or issue.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.180]   It's just what some people call a party song,
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.980]   or it's something that's just uplifting,
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.020]   not just to them, but to many other people,
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.100]   which actually brings up an interesting
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.260]   and future-looking point, which is that nowadays,
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.900]   we are seeing the emergence of AI, artificial intelligence,
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.940]   being used to generate new songs
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.900]   by capturing these well-established rules,
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.320]   gleaned from neuroscience of how music impacts the brain,
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.900]   such that in the future, artificial intelligence
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.980]   is going to be generating hit songs for us,
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.160]   as opposed to having people generating hit songs.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.400]   I know this evokes a state of concern and fear
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.240]   in many people.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.760]   I think that this is a fear that needs to be matched with,
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.360]   I don't know, perhaps a cautious optimism.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.200]   I mean, who knows?
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.100]   Maybe there are patterns of music, including lyrics,
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.440]   that human beings, in their current understanding
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.200]   of themselves and of music,
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.400]   have not yet been able to tap into, and who knows?
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.600]   Maybe AI will be generating the best music
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.320]   that we've ever heard,
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.720]   or perhaps music that can shift our states
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.620]   from more depressed or sad to heightened levels of happiness
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.360]   in ways that humans have just not been able to accomplish.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.400]   So I think it's important to balance any pessimism
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.160]   about AI and its ability to generate music
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.680]   based on these rules of how music impacts the brain
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.900]   with an open-mindedness.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:17.180]   After all, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and neural recordings
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.940]   directly with electrodes in the brain,
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.580]   while people are listening to music,
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:23.180]   is teaching us how the brain responds to that music
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:27.020]   and is giving us information that indeed human beings,
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.720]   but also computers, can use
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.200]   in order to generate stimuli, music,
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.580]   that can shift our brain into more positive states.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.020]   And if that's the case, wouldn't that be wonderful?
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:40.280]   Another established feature of happy music is, get this,
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.000]   its ability to get people to relax the furrow of their brow,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.160]   indeed to raise their eyebrows and to be a bit wide-eyed,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.900]   and not just through autonomic arousal,
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.560]   but rather through activation of the muscles in the face.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.480]   Conversely, we know that sad music,
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.280]   and here we can define sad music,
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.940]   this has actually been done in the literature,
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.920]   sad music tends to be slower than average,
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.920]   slower than 60 beats per minutes or so, again, on average.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.740]   And this again is independent of the lyrics
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.020]   that might not even be present in the song.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:17.280]   Sad music tends to activate the corrugator muscles
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.540]   of the forehead, which are the muscles that furrow the brow
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.180]   and that lead to a kind of serious look.
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.640]   It's a folding in of the face,
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.920]   as opposed to a widening up of the eyes
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.820]   and a relaxation of the brow.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.640]   Now, given where we are in the course of this discussion,
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.100]   that shouldn't be surprising.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.380]   We already talked about how listening to particular sounds
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.520]   evokes the release of particular neurochemicals,
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.300]   but in a more direct fashion,
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.500]   listening to particular sounds
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.620]   activates certain premotor and motor circuits
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.540]   within the brain and body,
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:49.480]   not just the desire to move one's torso, limbs, or both,
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.840]   bob one's head or move a head side to side,
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.500]   but also the micro structures of the face,
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.820]   which because one of the main roles of the face
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.280]   is to communicate emotion,
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.580]   is going to cause either a relaxation of the brow
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:06.340]   and a lifting of the eyebrows or a furrowing
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.940]   or a activation of the corrugator muscles
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.240]   of the eyebrow.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:13.240]   And if that's not obvious and yet interesting enough,
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.560]   well, get this, there seems to be a direct relationship,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.820]   I'm chuckling 'cause this still just blows my mind
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.640]   because it's a total duh, obvious when you hear it,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.580]   but it's still just so cool,
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:27.020]   that there's a direct relationship of the frequency
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:27.860]   of the sound that you hear,
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:30.060]   either low pitched or high pitched
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.700]   and the cadence of that sound,
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:32.860]   and here I realize I'm not using
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.320]   technical music theory language,
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.180]   but whether or not that particular tone is played
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.460]   over and over close in time or more spaced out in time
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.260]   and facial expressions,
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:48.260]   and indeed when we listen to base tones,
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.580]   low frequency tones set apart from one another
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.980]   with some distance so that they're not overlapping,
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:58.480]   we get the all too familiar base face.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.540]   So what I'm referring to here is what neuroscientists
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.580]   would call a labeled line,
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.420]   literally a circuit of neurons
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.820]   that goes from the periphery, in this case, our ears,
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.300]   into our brain through several different stations
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:15.300]   and then wicks out to impact all sorts of things within us,
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.660]   states of emotion, states of motivation,
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.860]   our propensity to move,
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.860]   but also a labeled line circuit
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:26.020]   coming from hearing low frequency sounds
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.220]   played spaced apart from one another
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.280]   that evokes a particular facial expression,
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.920]   and again, this takes us back to the earlier statement
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:37.120]   that I made, which is not an original statement frankly,
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.880]   there are people within the field of auditory processing
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.180]   and understanding how the brain processes music,
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.000]   in fact, one of the world experts in this,
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.120]   Dr. Eric Jarvis at the Rockefeller University
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.340]   was a guest on this podcast
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.700]   where we talked about the relationship
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.820]   between music, movement, and singing,
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.560]   and the fact that music, movement, in particular dance,
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.300]   and singing likely preceded the evolution
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.260]   of modern spoken language.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:06.640]   Well, Eric Jarvis and others have argued quite convincingly
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.200]   that these circuits that I'm calling labeled lines
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.680]   to particular facial expressions and states of emotion
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.100]   are the most fundamental components of communication
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.260]   and the ways that humans have communicated
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.960]   about their emotional state
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.140]   and literally induced that same emotional state
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.740]   in other members of our species
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.940]   dating back tens of thousands, if not more years.
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.060]   One of the fun things about researching this episode
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.340]   on music and the brain
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.180]   is that there are a lot of quality studies
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.900]   exploring how music impacts the brain,
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.820]   neuroimaging, neural recording data
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:40.280]   from excellent laboratories, as well as a lot of studies.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.840]   In fact, a surprising number of studies
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.940]   exploring how particular types of music impacts mood states.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:47.660]   And fortunately, that allowed me to glean
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.620]   some very specific recommendations
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.200]   as to the minimum amounts of, say, happy music
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.040]   that you need to listen to
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.360]   in order to shift your mood into a happier state.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.420]   And indeed, the numbers exist in the literature,
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.580]   and it has been shown that the threshold
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:04.500]   for significantly shifting one's mood into a happier state
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.880]   by listening to the sorts of music we talked about before,
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.980]   that faster cadence music, even with nonsense lyrics,
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.700]   although it could include other lyrics,
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.540]   instead is nine minutes.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:16.420]   Not 10, not eight, but nine.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.040]   And I'm sort of joking when I say not 10, not eight, but nine
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.040]   because, of course, you could listen to music
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.900]   for 10 minutes or 15 minutes or longer.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.360]   In fact, earlier, we talked about the benefits of doing that.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.780]   But when one examines the various studies
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.400]   that looked at how long subjects need to listen to music
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.700]   in order to shift their mood into a happier state,
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.980]   the threshold seems to be nine minutes.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.760]   So if you want to feel happier than you currently feel,
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.220]   it seems that listening to happy music for nine minutes
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.860]   or more is going to be the effective approach.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.100]   Okay, so nine minutes or more to shift one state to happier.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:53.180]   What about to process somber or sad feelings,
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.980]   feelings of loss?
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:58.900]   Well, this raises an even bigger question,
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.620]   and it's a question that I also get very often.
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.180]   As you're noticing, I get a lot of questions often.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.160]   In any event, one of the common questions that I get
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.840]   is when we are feeling sad or experiencing a loss,
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.500]   grieving the loss of a relationship by death or decision
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:19.700]   or by somebody moving away or the loss of a pet, et cetera,
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.720]   is it better to go into that state,
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.080]   in other words, to quote, unquote, feel one's feelings
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.040]   or to counter those feelings?
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.300]   Now, historically, that's been a very difficult question
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.820]   for me to answer because who am I to say
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:35.020]   whether or not you should feel your feelings
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.720]   or whether or not feeling those feelings
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.900]   will take you down a trench of feeling much worse
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:39.980]   or much better?
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.500]   In fact, there's an emerging literature
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.380]   exactly about that issue.
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:47.140]   That is whether or not the catharsis model is really best,
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.700]   catharsis being the expression and feeling of one's emotions
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.740]   as a way to extrude or get rid of those emotions
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.780]   or whether or not that simply drives us further down
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.460]   the trench of those emotions.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.340]   That's really something that we should address
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.840]   in a separate podcast episode.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.980]   And I will have experts from the fields of psychiatry
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.220]   and psychology to help us address that question directly.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.060]   But since we're talking about music and the brain
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.780]   and the fact that music has a tremendous capacity
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:15.540]   to evoke emotional states, including sad states,
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.940]   what has been shown in the peer-reviewed literature
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:21.680]   is that when people who are feeling sad,
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.640]   for whatever reason, loss of relationship, death, who knows,
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.540]   doesn't really matter why they're feeling sad after all.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.420]   It's that they're feeling sad.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:37.420]   Listening to 13 minutes or more of sad music,
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:41.820]   that music can contain lyrics they are familiar with
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:44.420]   or no lyrics, regardless of whether or not
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:47.200]   it contains lyrics, it's going to be on average
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.260]   50 or 60 beats per minute or less.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.660]   We established that already.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:54.880]   Listening to that for 13 minutes or more
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.820]   has been shown to be effective in allowing people
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.080]   to quote unquote process their somber feelings
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.120]   and to some extent to move past their feelings of sadness.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.860]   So those studies support the idea that when feeling sad,
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.880]   feeling one's feelings and perhaps even amplifying
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.080]   those feelings of sadness by listening to sad music
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.900]   for 13 minutes or more can help people
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.860]   process those sad feelings.
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.620]   And while that point might seem overly reductionist,
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:23.940]   I actually think it's a real value.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:26.500]   I'm certainly familiar with feelings of loss,
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.220]   feelings of grief, and I've often struggled
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.900]   with this question of, gosh, do I try and just push it aside
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.080]   or do I deal with those feelings?
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080]   Again, this is something that you really need to determine
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.100]   for yourself, but what these studies show
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.860]   pretty conclusively is that when we're feeling sad,
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:46.580]   matching that sadness or amplifying that sadness
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.720]   by listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.140]   can help us move through that state of sadness.
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.980]   And one could argue this is more or less the use
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:57.100]   of catharsis of amplifying emotional expression
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.660]   or feeling in order to try and move that feeling out
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.660]   is a classic idea originating in Freudian psychology,
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.220]   but probably before then as well.
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.320]   But in any event, I think these data support the idea
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.860]   that even when feeling sad, perhaps especially
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.860]   when feeling sad, amplifying or matching those feelings
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:19.860]   through the use of sad music for 13 minutes or more,
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.900]   again, you don't need to set a timer for 13 minutes,
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.100]   but giving yourself a period of time
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.500]   to just listen to that music is one way
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.660]   that can help you move through that state of sadness
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:31.060]   and then be able to lean back into other areas of life.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.180]   So we've talked about the role of music in evoking
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.680]   or shifting states of happiness and sadness.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.800]   There are also interesting data that support the use of music
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.500]   for shifting one out of a state of heightened anxiety.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.220]   And I find this especially interesting because my laboratory
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.340]   for a long time has worked on behavioral interventions
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.720]   to reduce anxiety, things like the physiological psi,
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.860]   which if you're not familiar with,
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:56.460]   you can put physiological psi and my last name into YouTube.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.700]   And there's a demonstration of that.
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.820]   It's a breathing technique of two inhales through the nose
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:02.420]   and a long exhale through the mouth, the lungs empty,
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.820]   that at this point in time,
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.440]   we understand to be the fastest and most effective way
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.460]   to reduce one's levels of anxiety in real time.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.040]   So it's two inhales through the nose,
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.860]   long to lungs empty, exhale through the mouth.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.460]   That's the physiological psi.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.700]   Earlier, we talked about the fact that one of the main ways
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:25.820]   in which listening to music shifts heart rate
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.860]   and increases heart rate variability,
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.340]   and thereby positively shifts
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.880]   a number of different health metrics
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.400]   is through shifts in breathing.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.580]   So I justify that brief vignette about the physiological psi
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.040]   as within the general context
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.080]   of what we're talking about today.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.400]   In any event, there are data that have explored
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:48.160]   whether or not specific musical stimuli
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.700]   can be used to significantly reduce anxiety.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.140]   In particular, one published
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.820]   out of the University of Pennsylvania,
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.500]   and I'll provide a link to this study
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:57.920]   in the show note captions,
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.380]   which shows that people that listen to a particular song
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.060]   that I'll describe in a moment,
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.300]   experience up to 65% reductions in their anxiety.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.500]   That's a significant reduction in anxiety.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   And I should point out that 65% reduction in anxiety,
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:18.800]   in this case, was accomplished with just three minutes
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.240]   of listening to this one particular song.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.040]   And get this, that particular song
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.440]   was as effective in reducing anxiety
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.040]   as one of the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.600]   So what is this magical anxiety-reducing song?
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:37.060]   The title of the song is "Waitless" by Marconi Union.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:39.880]   I hadn't heard of the song prior to researching this episode.
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.640]   I did indeed look up the song on YouTube
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.200]   and listen to the song.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.400]   I will provide a link to the song in the show note captions.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.900]   I confess that it is a very relaxing song.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:52.800]   I also confess that I was not experiencing anxiety
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.200]   when I listened to the song,
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.300]   but it was successful in reducing my level
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.600]   of overall autonomic arousal.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.240]   I found myself more relaxed, et cetera.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.400]   Now, of course, what I'm describing
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.540]   in terms of my own experience is not a peer-reviewed study.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.720]   It's what I would call anecdata,
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.840]   meaning I'm just describing my experience.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.880]   But again, there are peer-reviewed studies
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.560]   exploring how this particular song
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.200]   shifts one's autonomic state.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.280]   And I think this three minutes of listening to this one song
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.000]   should at least be tried by anyone
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.360]   that's trying to reduce their anxiety,
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.680]   because unless you're listening to the song
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.080]   in some way that I'm not aware of,
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.440]   like excessively loud or something of that sort,
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.840]   I can't imagine how listening to the song
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.280]   would be detrimental in any way.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.560]   And if you are anything like the subjects in the study
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.520]   that they explored, it could very well be beneficial
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.320]   and help you reduce your anxiety.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.060]   It's also something that you could keep queued up
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.540]   in your phone or on any device,
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.120]   such that if you think you may experience anxiety,
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.360]   you just put your headphones in and listen to it.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.640]   You might be wondering whether or not
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.840]   Marconi Union's "Waitless" is only three minutes long.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.140]   Well, I don't know the answer to that,
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.460]   because when you go on YouTube,
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.040]   what you'll see is that clearly a number of people
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.680]   are benefiting from listening to the song
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:01.700]   to reduce their anxiety,
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.260]   or at least that a number of people have listened
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:06.740]   to this song, because if you put Marconi Union "Waitless"
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.700]   into the search function on YouTube,
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.820]   what you'll quickly discover is that the top video
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:15.820]   has, get this, 47 million views, and it's 10 hours long.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.920]   Now, across today's episode,
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.240]   it's been in the back of my mind
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.660]   that some of you out there perhaps are trained musicians,
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.620]   that you grew up playing an instrument,
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.040]   perhaps sang in choir or at school,
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.540]   perhaps you played multiple instruments,
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.880]   perhaps you even know music theory,
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.240]   whereas others, such as myself,
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.880]   were encouraged to play an instrument when we were younger,
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.800]   but then abandoned that instrument.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.160]   In fact, I'll just tell you a brief story.
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.980]   When I was a kid, every kid in school was required
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:44.820]   to pick an instrument.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.820]   My parents, for whatever reason,
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.400]   clearly they didn't ask me what I wanted to do,
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.980]   they asked me to play the violin in school.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:57.380]   And I got the violin, I started playing the violin,
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.100]   I took the Suzuki method lessons.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:02.080]   This is where you don't learn to read music directly.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.980]   There's a number assignment to the different notes,
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:07.080]   and that's initially how you learn.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.220]   I was also supposed to listen to the songs while I slept,
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.200]   this idea that some of the music and musical learning
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.360]   could be encoded during sleep.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.840]   An interesting topic because there's actually
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.460]   some emerging evidence for that now,
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.320]   but at the time, as far as I know,
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.560]   there were no peer-reviewed studies,
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:24.080]   but nonetheless, it was thought that this works
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.360]   and perhaps it does.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.880]   Well, I can tell you one thing for sure,
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.280]   it did not work for me because I have one photo
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:34.280]   and truly just one from a concert that I played,
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.360]   I must've been about eight or nine years old,
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.960]   and within this photo, what you'll notice
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:42.800]   is there's a gallery of children, all with violins,
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.800]   all of whom's bows are up and my bow is down.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.680]   That in addition to the fact that my fly was open
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.080]   in the picture and the fact that every time
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.760]   I played the violin, either by practice
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.620]   or with the teacher present,
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.120]   when we would go to these once a week sessions
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:04.100]   with a individual teacher, people would cringe,
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:07.380]   animals would cringe, literally dogs would howl
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.300]   such that my parents did not encourage me
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:12.980]   to continue playing, in fact, they and many others
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:15.440]   encouraged me to quit playing, so I quit playing.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.100]   I confess I don't know how to play any instrument,
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:21.360]   I've attempted a few other instruments in my lifetime.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.140]   Yes, I believe in neuroplasticity,
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.240]   it is a hallmark feature of our brain,
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.620]   our brain can learn things even as adults,
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.040]   but the point I'm trying to make here
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.060]   is that I am not of the category of kids
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:36.080]   that played an instrument and understands music theory
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.520]   or how to read music, I simply don't.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.820]   And I realized that those of you that are listening to this
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:44.320]   or watching this out there are probably in a mixed category
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.740]   of proficiency all the way down to what I would consider
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:50.800]   my own relationship to music, which is deficiency,
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.120]   although I greatly enjoy listening to music
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:57.040]   and I do have a pretty good ability to memorize lyrics.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.220]   In any event, the reason I raised this is that
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:03.900]   there are now dozens, if not hundreds
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.960]   of quality peer reviewed studies using a variety
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.960]   of technical approaches that show that when children,
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.800]   especially children younger than eight,
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.920]   learn to play an instrument and even better,
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.740]   learn to play multiple instruments,
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.820]   regardless of whether or not they learn to read music,
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.540]   that it leads to greatly enhanced connectivity
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.500]   within their brain that persists into adulthood
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.820]   and that it facilitates other forms
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.740]   of neuroplasticity and learning,
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:35.040]   which is basically to say that my brain very likely
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.320]   does not include these enhanced circuits.
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.840]   Which circuits am I referring to?
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.580]   Well, there are a number of different circuits in the brain
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:42.720]   that have been shown to expand when children learn
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.500]   how to play an instrument as a child, eight or younger.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.600]   And again, eight isn't a strict cutoff
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.000]   and I always have to highlight this, forgive the tangent,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.520]   but when we say eight or younger,
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.620]   I don't want people with nine-year-old children
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.740]   or a 10-year-old kid or even 16-year-old kid listening
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.900]   or even adult listening to think,
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.860]   oh, you know, the window is shut for me.
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.220]   Because when one designs a study,
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.420]   you have to have some thresholds of who you include
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.700]   and who you don't include and sometimes that leads
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.260]   to these kind of artificial perceptions
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.340]   about where the cutoffs are.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.640]   But in any event, it's very clear
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.540]   that if you did learn an instrument when you were young
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:17.380]   or ideally even multiple instruments
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.980]   and even better would be to learn multiple instruments
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.460]   and how to sing along with instrumentals,
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:25.700]   especially in an improvised manner,
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:30.260]   well, your brain has expanded connectivity on average
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:33.020]   relative to children that did not have that experience.
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:36.540]   Now, the good news is that learning how to play
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:40.540]   an instrument or even, thankfully for me,
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:42.800]   listening to novel forms of music,
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.340]   music that you don't typically listen to
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:47.380]   for 30 to 60 minutes per day,
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.260]   and it doesn't have to be every day, in fact,
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:52.460]   it can even be just three days a week for 30 to 60 minutes,
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.940]   has been shown to expand brain connectivity
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.420]   in ways that of course lends itself
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:01.180]   to better musical comprehension and even performance.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:04.300]   But learning how to play a musical instrument at any age
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.300]   as well as singing and singing,
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.460]   especially with others in a group,
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:11.080]   has been shown to enhance learning
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.820]   and the acquisition of new skills
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:15.700]   separate from musical learning and singing.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.580]   In other words, it seems that learning how to play
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.580]   an instrument and singing are a gateway to neuroplasticity.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:26.140]   And this is, again, supported by neuroimaging data.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:28.260]   Some of the more striking of those data
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:30.200]   are that children that learned how to play
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.180]   one to three instruments when they were a kid
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.520]   or that sang in a choir or a group
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.900]   or that were taught to sing solo for that matter
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.580]   show up to 30% greater connectivity
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.080]   within this particular brain network
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.300]   that links the two hemispheres of the brain.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.580]   Now, as soon as I say two hemispheres of the brain,
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.660]   it starts drawing up a lot of ideas in people's heads,
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.860]   mainly derived from pop psychology
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.420]   that there are left-brained people and right-brained people.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.520]   I've touched on this before,
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.460]   but I want to make this abundantly clear again now.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:59.580]   Most of what you've heard
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.620]   about so-called left-brained people or right-brained people
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.740]   is complete and total nonsense.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.820]   It's myth.
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.540]   There are some functions in the brain
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.780]   that are lateralized to the left or the right hemisphere,
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:12.300]   in particular, prosody.
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:16.000]   They sort of lilting and falling of speech and in singing
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.540]   is highly lateralized in the brain.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.880]   Other aspects of language can be lateralized in the brain.
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.280]   But really, if you hear that certain people
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.520]   are more emotional or certain people are more logical
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.760]   based on right-brain, left-brain stuff,
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.480]   that stuff is completely false.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.080]   It's complete garbage, in fact.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.680]   It's not based in any real solid data.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.920]   So when I say that learning an instrument
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.200]   or learning how to sing young or even as an adult
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.240]   is beneficial for increasing the connectivity
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.880]   between the two sides of the brain,
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.120]   what that increased connectivity
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.520]   between the two sides of the brain,
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.320]   which is, by the way, mediated through a structure
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.440]   called the corpus callosum,
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:50.700]   is not about enhancing one's emotional capacity
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.160]   or logical capacity.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.360]   It's really about increasing the capacity
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.280]   of all brain circuits,
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.960]   or at least the brain circuits
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.520]   that are connected up directly with the corpus callosum,
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:02.040]   which includes many brain circuits
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.280]   for things like cognition, language learning,
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.880]   speech, mathematics.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.320]   A lot of people don't realize this,
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.080]   but a lot of musicians are also
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.000]   especially adept at mathematics.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.480]   And for you musicians,
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.920]   you're probably nodding, of course, right?
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.520]   Because music is grounded in theory
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.120]   that has basis in math and in physics,
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.080]   something that we will address in a future episode
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.760]   about harmonics, et cetera.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.960]   When children or adults learn
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.680]   how to play a musical instrument or several,
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:32.520]   or how to sing and play musical instruments,
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.360]   that increased connectivity in the corpus callosum
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.960]   is essentially providing multiple highways of option
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.700]   for learning all sorts of things.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.560]   So it's something that I highly encourage,
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.600]   so much so that I intend to finally, finally
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.240]   learn how to play an instrument.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:49.960]   I've got a particular instrument in mind
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.160]   that I've wanted to learn how to play for a very long time,
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.780]   but based on my prior experience
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.900]   with trying to learn an instrument,
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:58.920]   and because I like to consider myself a considerate person,
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.520]   I intend to do this more or less in isolation from people
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.680]   and indeed from animals as well.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.820]   And for those of you that don't have the time or energy
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.760]   or desire to learn new forms of music,
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.220]   you'll be perhaps delighted to know
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:14.840]   that just listening to novel forms of music,
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.620]   and in particular, when you listen to novel forms of music
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.520]   and you pay attention to that music,
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.420]   not just letting it play in the background,
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.900]   that too has been demonstrated
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.980]   to expand the brain's capacity for neuroplasticity,
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:29.660]   its ability to modify itself and make it better
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.460]   at learning other sorts of things,
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:33.120]   both cognitive and physical.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.640]   So I highly encourage you to listen to the music you love.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.680]   I certainly love to listen to the music
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.400]   that I delight in and have for so many years,
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.420]   but there's also strong scientific support
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:45.160]   to encourage listening to new forms of music
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.480]   that hopefully you will like,
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.900]   but nonetheless, the mere forging for
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.720]   and listening to novel forms of music itself
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.640]   seems to activate brain circuitry in a way
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:57.000]   that allows for better learning and comprehension
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.440]   of all sorts of things.
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.880]   So today we've been talking about music in the brain,
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.280]   and I confess this is an enormous topic,
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.400]   so much so that I had to discard
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:09.840]   with entire sets of data and discussion
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.140]   around, for instance, the mathematical structure of music
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:15.560]   and how that relates to the mathematical structure
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.900]   of firing of neurons.
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:18.880]   We touched on this a little bit, however,
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.600]   in the context of certain frequencies of sounds
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.760]   that we hear creating certain frequencies
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.100]   of neuronal firing and activation in the brain.
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.020]   I mean, just think about that, how amazing that is.
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.100]   It's literally like the brain playing your neurons
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:30.980]   like a piano.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.580]   This is not what happens when you smell a particular odor
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.220]   or taste a particular taste
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.840]   or see a particular face or visual stimulus.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.640]   Incredible things happen within those senses as well,
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.980]   but there is something oh so fundamental and incredible
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.240]   about music and its ability to tap into our neural circuitry
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.440]   and our neural chemistry in ways
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.960]   that shift our emotional states and our motivational states.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.520]   So we talked about ways that music can be leveraged
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.180]   to shift our emotional and motivational states.
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.320]   Again, not as a way to reduce music
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.400]   to its reductionist parts,
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.920]   but rather to help us gain understanding
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.600]   into how the brain responds to music
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.520]   and how we can leverage music of all kinds
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.220]   with and without lyrics,
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:13.680]   how we can balance the contrast between music and silence
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.400]   to increase motivation and so on and so on.
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:17.600]   For those of you that are interested
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.320]   in the more formal structure of music
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.360]   and how it relates to brain function and vice versa,
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.340]   as well as for those of you that are interested
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.080]   in singing and songwriting
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.360]   and more along the lines of lyrical content
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.880]   and how singing in groups
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.080]   and how improvisation of singing and musical playing
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.220]   can impact brain function and plasticity,
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:39.360]   I promise you there's going to be both an expert guest
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.040]   coming on the podcast to discuss that,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.920]   as well as a solo episode on those topics.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.440]   Again, the topic of music and the brain
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.740]   being far too vast to cover in just one conversation.
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.520]   With that said, I hope that today's discussion
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.400]   allowed for you to think about music differently.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.020]   Hopefully it will lead you to listen to music
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:57.940]   a bit differently, perhaps even leverage music
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:59.620]   for different purposes in your life,
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.360]   and above all, to think about music and to enjoy music,
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.720]   either listening to it or playing it or both,
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.820]   because as you now know, music isn't just able
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.420]   to activate your brain,
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.800]   but rather your brain contains vast amounts of real estate
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.920]   that are literally there to listen to music.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.220]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.260]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:55.200]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.580]   for things like improving sleep,
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.020]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.500]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.080]   with Momentous Supplements,
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.540]   because Momentous Supplements are the very highest quality.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.300]   They also ship internationally,
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.200]   and they tend to focus on single ingredient formulations,
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.420]   which makes it easy to develop the most biologically
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.200]   effective and cost-effective supplement regimen for you.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.780]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.940]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.400]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:22.220]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:24.160]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.220]   please do so.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.740]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms,
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:30.660]   so that's Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads, and Facebook.
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:32.040]   And on all those platforms,
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.000]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.600]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.080]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.000]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.140]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:43.540]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.940]   And if you haven't already subscribed to our newsletter,
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.780]   we have a zero-cost monthly newsletter,
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:49.220]   it's called the Neural Network Newsletter,
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:52.320]   that provides podcast summaries, as well as toolkits,
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.980]   such as a toolkit for sleep, toolkit for focus,
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.420]   toolkit for neuroplasticity, toolkit for fitness,
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.160]   deliberate cold exposure, heat exposure, and on and on.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.880]   Again, all available zero cost.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.380]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:07.720]   scroll down to newsletter, tap on newsletter,
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.920]   and then give us your email.
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:09.760]   And I want to emphasize,
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.980]   we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:13.380]   Thank you once again for joining me
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:16.500]   for today's discussion about music and your brain.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.760]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.440]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.020]   [upbeat music]
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:25.600]   (upbeat music)
