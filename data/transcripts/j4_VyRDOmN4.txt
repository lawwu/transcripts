[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   The following is a conversation with Kamran Vafa,
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.760]   a theoretical physicist at Harvard
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.200]   specializing in string theory.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.960]   He is the winner of the 2017 Breakthrough Prize
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.320]   in Fundamental Physics,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.760]   which is the most lucrative academic prize in the world.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.440]   Quick mention of our sponsors, Headspace,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.880]   Jordan Harberger Show, Squarespace, and Allform.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.000]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.040]   As a side note, let me say that string theory
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.960]   is a theory of quantum gravity
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.280]   that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.680]   It says that quarks, electrons, and all other particles
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.320]   are made up of much tinier strings of vibrating energy.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920]   They vibrate in 10 or more dimensions,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.040]   depending on the flavor of the theory.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.600]   Different vibrating patterns result in different particles.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.680]   From its origins, for a long time,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.680]   string theory was seen as too good not to be true,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.360]   but has recently fallen out of favor
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.640]   in the physics community,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.200]   partly because over the past 40 years,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.120]   it has not been able to make any novel predictions
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.320]   that could then be validated through experiment.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.280]   Nevertheless, to this day,
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440]   it remains one of our best candidates
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.160]   for a theory of everything,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.560]   or a theory that unifies the laws of physics.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.040]   Let me mention that a similar story happened
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.000]   with neural networks
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.120]   in the field of artificial intelligence,
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.600]   where it fell out of favor
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.840]   after decades of promise and research,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.000]   but found success again in the past decade
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.360]   as part of the deep learning revolution.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140]   So I think it pays to keep an open mind,
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.040]   since we don't know which of the ideas in physics
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.080]   may be brought back decades later
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.640]   and be found to solve the biggest mysteries
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   in theoretical physics.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.980]   String theory still has that promise.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.760]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.820]   and here's my conversation with Kamran Vafa.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.700]   What is the difference between mathematics and physics?
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.460]   - Well, that's a difficult question,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.400]   because in many ways,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.640]   math and physics are unified in many ways,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.480]   so to distinguish them is not an easy task.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.840]   I would say that perhaps the goals
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.540]   of math and physics are different.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.440]   Math does not care to describe reality, physics does.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.200]   That's the major difference,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.360]   but a lot of the thoughts, processes, and so on,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.760]   which goes to understanding the nature and reality
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.680]   are the same things that mathematicians do.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.360]   So in many ways, they are similar.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.660]   Mathematicians care about deductive reasoning,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.480]   and physicists or physics in general,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.760]   we care less about that.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.000]   We care more about interconnection of ideas,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.880]   about how ideas support each other,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.240]   or if there's a puzzle, discord between ideas.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.200]   That's more interesting for us.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.560]   And part of the reason is that we have learned in physics
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.320]   that the ideas are not sequential,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.920]   and if we think that there's one idea
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.040]   which is more important,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.200]   and we start with there and go to the next idea,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.760]   next one, and deduce things from that
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.600]   like mathematicians do,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.720]   we have learned that the third or fourth thing
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.580]   we deduce from that principle
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.380]   turns out later on to be the actual principle,
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.900]   and from a different perspective,
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.740]   starting from there leads to new ideas,
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.920]   which the original one didn't lead to,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.140]   and that's the beginning of a new revolution in science.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.240]   So this kind of thing we have seen again and again
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.080]   in the history of science,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.120]   we have learned to not like deductive reasoning,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.200]   because that gives us a bad starting point
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.260]   to think that we actually have the original thought process
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.220]   should be viewed as the primary thought,
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.920]   and all these are deductions,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.600]   like the way mathematicians sometimes do.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.000]   So in physics, we have learned to be skeptical
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.920]   of that way of thinking.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.240]   We have to be a bit open to the possibility
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.280]   that what we thought is a deduction of a hypothesis
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.080]   actually the reason that's true is the opposite,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.940]   and so we reverse the order.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.640]   And so this switching back and forth between ideas
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   makes us more fluid about a deductive fashion.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.460]   Of course, it sometimes gives a wrong impression
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.960]   like physicists don't care about rigor,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.400]   they just say random things,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.900]   they are willing to say things that are not backed
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.220]   by the logical reasoning, that's not true at all.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.620]   So despite this fluidity
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.000]   in seeing which one is a primary thought,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.080]   we are very careful about trying to understand
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.680]   what we have really understood
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.120]   in terms of relationship between ideas.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.000]   So that's an important ingredient,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.340]   and in fact, solid math being behind physics
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.200]   is I think one of the attractive features of a physical law.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.280]   So we look for beautiful math underpinning it.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.760]   - Can we dig into that process of starting from one place
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.040]   and then ending up at like the fourth step
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.440]   and realizing all along that the place
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.000]   you started at was wrong?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.560]   So is that happen when there's a discrepancy
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.120]   between what the math says
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.960]   and what the physical world shows?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.840]   Is that how you then can go back
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.680]   and do the revolutionary idea
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040]   for different starting place altogether?
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.800]   - Perhaps I give an example to see how it goes,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   and in fact, the historical example
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.160]   is Newton's work on classical mechanics.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.000]   So Newton formulated the laws of mechanics,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.840]   you know, the force F equals to ma and his other laws,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.960]   and they look very simple, elegant, and so forth.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.840]   Later, when we studied more examples of mechanics
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.640]   and other similar things,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.960]   physicists came up with the idea
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.400]   that the notion of potential is interesting.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.800]   Potential was an abstract idea which kind of came,
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.000]   you could take its gradient and relate it to the force,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.720]   so you don't really need a a priori,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.200]   but it solved, helped some thoughts.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.960]   And then later, Euler and Lagrange reformulated
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.240]   Newtonian mechanics in a totally different way
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.360]   in the following fashion.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.880]   They said, if you wanna know where a particle
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.520]   at this point and at this time,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.000]   how does it get to this point at the later time,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.920]   is the following.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.640]   You take all possible paths connecting this particle
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.680]   from going from the initial point to the final point,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.160]   and you compute the action.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.400]   And what is an action?
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.760]   Action is the integral over time
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.160]   of the kinetic term of the particle minus its potential.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.800]   So you take this integral,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.080]   and each path will give you some quantity.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.060]   And the path it actually takes, the physical path,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.580]   is the one which minimizes this integral or this action.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.880]   Now, this sounded like a backwards step from Newton's.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.720]   Newton's formula seemed very simple.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.680]   F equals to ma, and you can write F
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.840]   is minus the gradient of the potential.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.040]   So why would anybody start formulating such a simple thing
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.240]   in terms of this complicated looking principle?
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.760]   You have to study the space of all paths and all things
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.760]   and find the minimum, and then you get the same equation.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.040]   So what's the point?
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.440]   So Euler and Lagrange's formulation of Newton,
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   which was kind of recasting in this language,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.040]   is just a consequence of Newton's law.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.800]   F equals to ma gives you the same fact
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.200]   that this path is a minimum action.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.440]   Now, what we learned later, last century,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.520]   was that when we deal with quantum mechanics,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.760]   Newton's law is only an average correct.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.840]   And the particle going from one to the other
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.880]   doesn't take exactly one path.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.800]   It takes all the paths with the amplitude,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.240]   which is proportional to the exponential of the action
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.940]   times an imaginary number, i.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.960]   And so this fact turned out to be the reformulation
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.780]   of quantum mechanics.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.520]   We should start there as the basis of the new law,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   which is quantum mechanics.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.560]   And Newton is only an approximation
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.000]   on the average correct.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.360]   - When we say amplitude, you mean probability?
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.200]   - Yes, the amplitude means if you sum up all these paths
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.100]   with exponential i times the action,
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.400]   if you sum this up, you get the number, complex number.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.480]   You square the norm of this complex number,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.760]   gives you a probability to go from one to the other.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   - Is there ways in which mathematics can lead us astray
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.480]   when we use it as a tool to understand the physical world?
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.580]   - Yes, I would say that mathematics can lead us astray
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.240]   as much as old physical ideas can lead us astray.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.680]   So if you get stuck in something,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.280]   then you can easily fool yourself
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.520]   that just like the thought process,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.300]   we have to free ourselves of that.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.720]   Sometimes math does that role.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.560]   Like say, oh, this is such a beautiful math.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.040]   I definitely wanna use it somewhere.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.840]   And so you just get carried away
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.760]   and you just get maybe carried too far away.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.960]   So that is certainly true,
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.040]   but I wouldn't say it's more dangerous
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.640]   than old physical ideas.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.400]   To me, new math ideas is as much potential
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.380]   to lead us astray as old physical ideas,
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.780]   which could be long-held principles of physics.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.860]   So I'm just saying that we should keep an open mind
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.900]   about the role that math plays,
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.020]   not to be antagonistic towards it
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.980]   and not to over-welcoming it.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.060]   We should just be open to possibilities.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.660]   - What about looking at a particular characteristics
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.700]   of both physical ideas and mathematical ideas,
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.820]   which is beauty?
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.780]   You think beauty leads us astray,
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.180]   meaning, and you offline showed me a really nice puzzle
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.400]   that illustrates this idea a little bit.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.020]   Now, maybe you can speak to that or another example
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.520]   where beauty makes it tempting for us to assume
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.360]   that the law and the theory we found
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.740]   is actually one that perfectly describes reality.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.800]   - I think that beauty does not lead us astray
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.920]   because I feel that beauty is a requirement
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.760]   for principles of physics.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   - So beauty is a fundamental in the universe?
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.920]   - I think beauty is fundamental.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.800]   At least that's the way many of us view it.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   - It's not emergent?
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.120]   - It's not emergent.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.720]   I think Hardy is the mathematician who said
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.760]   that there's no permanent place for ugly mathematics.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.900]   And so I think the same is true in physics,
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.800]   that if we find a principle which looks ugly,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.640]   we are not going to be, that's not the end stage.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.000]   So therefore, beauty is going to lead us somewhere.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.800]   Now, it doesn't mean beauty is enough.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.440]   It doesn't mean if you just have beauty,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.920]   if I just look at something is beautiful, then I'm fine.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.240]   No, that's not the case.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   Beauty is certainly a criteria
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.480]   that every good physical theory should pass.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.520]   That's at least the view we have.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.280]   Why do we have this view?
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.760]   That's a good question.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.000]   It is partly, you could say,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.080]   based on experience of science over centuries,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   partly is philosophical view of what reality is or should be.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.760]   And in principle, it could have been ugly
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.520]   and we might have had to deal with it,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.560]   but we have gotten maybe confident
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.000]   through examples after examples in the history of science
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.480]   to look for beauty.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.280]   - And our sense of beauty seems to incorporate
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.040]   a lot of things that are essential for us
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.000]   to solve some difficult problems like symmetry.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.360]   We find symmetry beautiful
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.260]   and the breaking of symmetry beautiful.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.440]   Somehow symmetry is a fundamental part
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.040]   of how we conceive of beauty at all layers of reality,
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.240]   which is interesting.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   Like in both the visual space, like where we look at art,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.120]   we look at each other as human beings,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.800]   the way we look at creatures in the biological space,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.280]   the way we look at chemistry,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.400]   and then to the physics world as the work you do.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.440]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.040]   It makes you wonder like,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.000]   which one is the chicken or the egg?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.800]   Is symmetry the chicken
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.600]   and our conception of beauty the egg
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.360]   or the other way around?
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   Or somehow the fact that the symmetry is part of reality,
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.200]   it somehow creates a brain that then is able to perceive it?
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.040]   Or maybe this is just 'cause we,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   maybe it's so obvious it's almost trivial
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.520]   that symmetry, of course,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.400]   will be part of every kind of universe that's possible.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.000]   And then any kind of organism
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.600]   that's able to observe that universe
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.320]   is going to appreciate symmetry.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.040]   - Well, these are good questions.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.380]   We don't have a deep understanding
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.720]   of why we get attracted to symmetry.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.920]   Why do laws of nature seem to have symmetries
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.080]   underlying them?
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.900]   And the reasoning, the examples of whether,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.720]   if it wasn't symmetry, we would have understood it or not.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.840]   We could have said that, yeah,
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.040]   if there were things which didn't look that great,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.900]   we could understand them.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.040]   For example, we know that symmetries get broken
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.280]   and we have appreciated nature
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.400]   in the broken symmetry phase as well.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.280]   The world we live in has many things
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.120]   which do not look symmetric,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.960]   but even those have underlying symmetry
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.640]   when you look at it more deeply.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.080]   So we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.960]   by the appearance of symmetry all over the place
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.000]   and we look for it.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.200]   And I think this is perhaps related
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.320]   to the sense of aesthetics that scientists have.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.760]   And we don't usually talk about it among scientists.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.560]   In fact, it's kind of a philosophical view
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.240]   of why do we look for simplicity or beauty or so forth.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.440]   And I think in a sense,
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.880]   scientists are a lot like philosophers.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.200]   Sometimes I think, especially modern science
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.880]   seems to shun philosophers and philosophical views.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.400]   And I think at their peril.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.360]   I think in my view, science owes a lot to philosophy.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.160]   And in my view, many scientists,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.180]   in fact, probably all good scientists
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.840]   are perhaps amateur philosophers.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.020]   They may not state that they are philosophers
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.400]   or they may not like to be labeled philosophers,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.740]   but in many ways, what they do
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.640]   is like what is philosophical takes of things.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.320]   Looking for simplicity or symmetry
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.640]   is an example of that in my opinion, or seeing patterns.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.680]   You see, for example, another example of the symmetry
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.440]   is like how you come up with new ideas in science.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.880]   You see, for example, an idea A
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.640]   is connected with an idea B.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.800]   Okay, so you study this connection very deeply
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.280]   and then you find the cousin of an idea A,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   let me call it A prime.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.060]   And then you immediately look for B prime.
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.260]   If A is like B and if there's an A prime,
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.360]   then you look for B prime.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.180]   Why?
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.920]   Because it completes the picture.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.760]   Why?
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.180]   Well, it's philosophically appealing
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.280]   to have more balance in terms of that.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.560]   And then you look for B prime
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.600]   and lo and behold, you find this other phenomenon,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.160]   which is a physical phenomenon, which you call B prime.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.600]   So this kind of thinking motivates
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.500]   asking questions and looking for things.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.560]   And it has guided scientists, I think, through many centuries
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.840]   and I think it continues to do so today.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.960]   - And I think if you look at the long arc of history,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.440]   I suspect that the things that will be remembered
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   is the philosophical flavor of the ideas of physics
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.540]   and chemistry and computer science and mathematics.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:29.320]   Like I think the actual details
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.220]   will be shown to be incomplete or maybe wrong,
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.980]   but the philosophical intuitions
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.880]   will carry through much longer.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.380]   There's a sense in which, if it's true,
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.260]   that we haven't figured out most of how things work currently
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.180]   that it'll all be shown as wrong and silly.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.940]   It'd almost be a historical artifact.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.700]   But the human spirit, whatever,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.140]   like the longing to understand the way we perceive the world,
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.780]   the way we conceive of it, of our place in the world,
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.540]   those ideas will carry on.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.380]   - I completely agree.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.620]   In fact, I believe that almost,
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.260]   well, I believe that none of the principles
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.620]   or laws of physics we know today are exactly correct.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.740]   All of them are approximations to something.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.700]   They're better than the previous versions that we had,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.780]   but none of them are exactly correct
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.980]   and none of them are gonna stand forever.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.820]   So I agree that that's the process we are heading,
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.140]   we are improving.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.420]   And yes, indeed, the thought process
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.820]   and that philosophical take is common.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.460]   So when we look at older scientists
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.060]   or maybe even all the way back to Greek philosophers
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.420]   and the things that the way they thought and so on,
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.140]   almost everything they said about nature was incorrect.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.900]   But the way they thought about it
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.820]   and many things that they were thinking
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.940]   is still valid today.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.060]   For example, they thought about symmetry breaking.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.980]   They were trying to explain the following.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.660]   This is a beautiful example, I think.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.900]   They had figured out that the earth is round
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.420]   and they said, okay, earth is round.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.300]   They have seen the length of the shadow of a meter stick
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.140]   and they have seen that
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.540]   if you go from the equator upwards north,
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.460]   they find that depending on how far away you are,
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.900]   that the length of the shadow changes.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.900]   And from that, they had even measured
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.260]   the radius of the earth to good accuracy.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.460]   - That's brilliant, by the way,
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.540]   the fact that they did that.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.660]   - Very brilliant, very brilliant.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.740]   So these Greek philosophers are very smart.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.640]   And so they had taken it to the next step.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.100]   They asked, okay, so the earth is round.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.200]   Why doesn't it move?
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.260]   They thought it doesn't move.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.520]   They were looking around, nothing seemed to move.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.420]   So they said, okay, we have to have a good explanation.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.300]   It wasn't enough for them to be there.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.060]   So they really wanna deeply understand that fact
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.660]   and they come up with a symmetry argument.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.300]   And the symmetry argument was,
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.460]   oh, if the earth is a spherical,
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.500]   it must be at the center of the universe for sure.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.420]   So they said the earth is at the center of the universe.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.260]   - That makes sense.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.700]   - And they said, if the earth is going to move,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.180]   which direction does it pick?
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.820]   Any direction it picks, it breaks that spherical symmetry
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.060]   because you have to pick a direction.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.340]   And that's not good because it's not symmetrical anymore.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.940]   So therefore, the earth decides to sit put
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.940]   because it would break the symmetry.
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.780]   So they had the incorrect science.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.900]   They thought earth doesn't move
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.660]   and they had this beautiful idea
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.220]   that symmetry might explain it.
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.620]   But they were even smarter than that.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.780]   Aristotle didn't agree with this argument.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.420]   He said, why do you think symmetry prevents it from moving?
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.920]   Because the preferred position?
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.340]   Not so.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.300]   He gave an example.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.100]   He said, suppose you are a person
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.300]   and we put you at the center of a circle
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.900]   and we spread food around you on a circle around you,
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.020]   loaves of bread, let's say.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.060]   And we say, okay, stay at the center of the circle forever.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.060]   Are you going to do that just because of the symmetric point?
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.620]   No, you are going to get hungry.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.940]   You're going to move towards one of those loaves of bread
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.460]   despite the fact that it breaks the symmetry.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.340]   So from this way, he tried to argue
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.620]   being at the symmetric point
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.360]   may not be the preferred thing to do.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.540]   And this idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.620]   is something we just used today
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.580]   to describe many physical phenomena.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.600]   So spontaneous symmetry breaking
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.940]   is the feature that we now use.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.040]   But this idea was there thousands of years ago,
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.020]   but applied incorrectly to the physical world,
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.020]   but now we are using it.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.740]   So these ideas are coming back in different forms.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.360]   So I agree very much that the thought process
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.000]   is more important and these ideas are more interesting
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.180]   than the actual applications that people may find today.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.660]   - Did they use the language of symmetry
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.700]   and the symmetry breaking and spontaneous symmetry?
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.180]   But that's really interesting.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.500]   'Cause I could see a conception of the universe
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.180]   that kind of tends towards perfect symmetry
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.980]   and is stuck there.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.740]   Like not stuck there, but achieves that optimal
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.100]   and stays there.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.900]   The idea that you would spontaneously break out of symmetry,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.460]   like have these perturbations,
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.180]   jump out of symmetry and back.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.300]   That's a really difficult idea to load into your head.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   Like where does that come from?
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.940]   And then the idea that you may not be
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.420]   at the center of the universe.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.940]   That is a really tough idea.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.320]   - Right, so symmetry sometimes an explanation
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.940]   of being at the symmetric point
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.940]   is sometimes a simple explanation of many things.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.540]   Like if you have a ball, a circular ball,
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.140]   then the bottom of it is the lowest point.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.740]   So if you put a pebble or something,
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.580]   it will slide down and go there at the bottom
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.740]   and stays there at the symmetric point,
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.420]   because the preferred point, the lowest energy point.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.260]   But if that same symmetric circular ball that you had
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.580]   had a bump on the bottom,
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.380]   the bottom might not be at the center,
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.940]   it might be on a circle on the table.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.300]   In which case the pebble would not end up at the center,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.900]   it would be the lower energy point.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.020]   Symmetrical, but it breaks the symmetry
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.180]   once it picks a point on that circle.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.920]   So we can have symmetry reasoning for where things end up
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.740]   or symmetry breakings, like this example would suggest.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.500]   - We talked about beauty.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.660]   I find geometry to be beautiful.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.420]   You have a few examples that are geometric in nature
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.500]   in your book.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.840]   How can geometry in ancient times or today
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.500]   be used to understand reality?
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.600]   And maybe how do you think about geometry
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.540]   as a distinct tool in mathematics and physics?
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.940]   - Yes, geometry is my favorite part of math as well.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.480]   And Greeks were enamored by geometry.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.500]   They tried to describe physical reality
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.980]   using geometry and principles of geometry and symmetry.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.220]   Platonic solids, the five solids they had discovered,
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.220]   had these beautiful solids.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.300]   They thought it must be good for some reality.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.980]   They must be explaining something.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.700]   They attached one to air, one to fire and so forth.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.400]   They tried to give physical reality to symmetric objects.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.580]   These symmetric objects are symmetries of rotation
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.740]   and discrete symmetry groups we call today
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.400]   of rotation group in three dimensions.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.220]   Now, we know now, we kind of laugh at the way
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.500]   they were trying to connect that symmetry to, you know,
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.020]   the laws of the realities of physics.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.840]   But actually it turns out in modern days,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.820]   we use symmetries in not too far away
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.860]   exactly in these kinds of thoughts,
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.580]   processes in the following way.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.420]   In the context of string theory,
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.620]   which is the field light study,
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.840]   we have these extra dimensions.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.660]   And these extra dimensions are compact, tiny spaces
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.260]   typically, but they have different shapes and sizes.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.220]   We have learned that if these extra shapes and sizes
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.900]   have symmetries, which are related to the same
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.200]   rotation symmetries that the Greek were talking about,
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.540]   if they enjoy those discrete symmetries,
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.780]   and if you take that symmetry and quotient the space by it,
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.540]   in other words, identify points under these symmetries,
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.540]   you get properties of that space at the singular points,
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.460]   which force emanates from them.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.220]   What forces?
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.980]   Forces like the ones we have seen in nature today,
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.100]   like electric forces, like strong forces, like weak forces.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.900]   So these same principles that were driving them
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.620]   to connect geometry and symmetries to nature
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.440]   is driving today's physics.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.060]   Now much more, you know, modern ideas,
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.540]   but nevertheless the symmetries connecting geometry
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.360]   to physics.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.460]   In fact, often we sometimes we have,
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.580]   we ask the following question,
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.840]   suppose I want to get this particular, you know,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.140]   physical reality, I want to have this particles
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.780]   with these forces and so on, what do I do?
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.480]   It turns out that you can geometrically design
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.180]   the space to give you that.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.400]   You say, oh, I put the sphere here, I will do this,
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.660]   I will shrink them.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.540]   So if you have two spheres touching each other
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.900]   and shrinking to zero size, that gives you strong forces.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.740]   If you have one of them, it gives you the weak forces.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.860]   If you have this, you get that.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.060]   And if you want to unify forces, do the other thing.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.500]   So these geometrical translation of physics
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.860]   is one of my favorite things that we have discovered
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.580]   in modern physics in the context of string theory.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.820]   - The sad thing is when you go into multiple dimensions
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.820]   and we'll talk about it is we start to lose our capacity
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.540]   to visually intuit the world we're discussing.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.660]   And then we go into the realm of mathematics
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.740]   and we'll lose that.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.680]   Unfortunately, our brains are such that we're limited.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.860]   But before we go into that mysterious, beautiful world,
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.440]   let's take a small step back.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.840]   And you also in your book have this kind of,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.260]   through the space of puzzles, through the space of ideas,
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.020]   have a brief history of physics, of physical ideas.
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.960]   Now, we talked about Newtonian mechanics,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.280]   a leading all through different Lagrangian,
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.960]   Hamiltonian mechanics.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.160]   Can you describe some of the key ideas
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.520]   in the history of physics, maybe lingering on each
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.600]   from electromagnetism to relativity to quantum mechanics
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.440]   and to today as we'll talk about with quantum gravity
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.720]   and string theory?
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.880]   - Sure, so I mentioned the classical mechanics
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.780]   and the Euler-Lagrange formulation.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.200]   One of the next important milestones for physics
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.240]   were the discoveries of laws of electricity and magnetism.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.500]   So Maxwell put the discoveries all together
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.600]   in the context of what we call the Maxwell's equations.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.880]   And he noticed that when he put these discoveries
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.640]   that Faraday's and others had made
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.000]   about electric and magnetic phenomena
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.220]   in terms of mathematical equations, it didn't quite work.
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.780]   There was a mathematical inconsistency.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.240]   Now, one could have two attitudes.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.760]   One would say, okay, who cares about math?
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.400]   I'm doing nature, electric force, magnetic force,
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.840]   math I don't care about.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.920]   But it bothered him.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.000]   It was inconsistent.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.080]   The equations he were writing,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.460]   the two equations he had written down
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.360]   did not agree with each other.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.320]   And this bothered him.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.300]   But he figured out, you know,
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.400]   if you add this jiggle this equation
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.080]   by adding one little term there, it works.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.560]   At least it's consistent.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.440]   What is the motivation for that term?
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.520]   He said, I don't know.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.080]   Have we seen it in experiments?
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.240]   No.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.060]   Why did you add it?
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.840]   Well, because of mathematical consistency.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.560]   So he said, okay, math forced him to do this term.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.460]   He added this term,
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.240]   which we now today call the Maxwell term.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.920]   And once he added that term,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.440]   his equations were nice, you know, differential equations,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.480]   mathematically consistent, beautiful.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.160]   But he also found a new physical phenomena.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.040]   He found that because of that term,
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   he could now get electric and magnetic waves
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.340]   moving through space at a speed that he could calculate.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.600]   So he calculated the speed of the wave.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.440]   And lo and behold,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.760]   he found it's the same as the speed of light,
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.520]   which puzzled him because he didn't think
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.820]   light had anything to do with electricity and magnetism.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.440]   But then he was courageous enough to say,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.960]   well, maybe light is nothing
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.660]   but these electric and magnetic fields moving around.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.960]   And he wasn't alive to see the verification
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.440]   of that prediction, and indeed it was true.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.480]   So this mathematical inconsistency,
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.440]   which we could say, you know,
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.280]   this mathematical beauty drove him
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.380]   to this physical, very important connection
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.120]   between light and electric and magnetic phenomena,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.560]   which was later confirmed.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.120]   So then physics progresses and it comes to Einstein.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.720]   Einstein looks at Maxwell's equation, says,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.160]   beautiful, these are nice equation,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.700]   except we get one speed light.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.480]   Who measures this light speed?
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.600]   And he asked the question,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.320]   are you moving, are you not moving?
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.800]   If you move, the speed of light changes,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.760]   but Maxwell's equation has no hint
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.400]   of different speeds of light.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.680]   It doesn't say, oh, only if you're not moving,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.520]   you get the speed.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.640]   It's just, you always get the speed.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.680]   So Einstein was very puzzled
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   and he was daring enough to say,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.960]   well, you know, maybe everybody
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   gets the same speed for light.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.360]   And that motivated his theory of special relativity.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.720]   And this is an interesting example
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.760]   because the idea was motivated from physics,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.520]   from Maxwell's equations,
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.160]   from the fact that people tried to measure
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.720]   the properties of ether,
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.760]   which was supposed to be the medium
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.720]   in which the light travels through.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.920]   And the idea was that only in that medium,
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.120]   the speed of, if you're at rest
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.480]   with respect to the ether,
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.600]   the speed of light,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.520]   and if you're moving, the speed changes.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.960]   And people did not discover it.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.360]   Michelson and Morley's experiments
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.080]   showed there is no ether.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.600]   So then Einstein was courageous enough to say,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.120]   you know, light is the same speed for everybody,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.480]   regardless of whether you're moving or not.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   And the interesting thing
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.520]   is about special theory of relativity
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.360]   is that the math underpinning it is very simple.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.480]   It's linear algebra.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.680]   Nothing terribly deep.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.840]   You can teach it at high school level,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.720]   if not earlier.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.880]   Okay, does that mean Einstein's
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.360]   special relativity is boring?
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.600]   Not at all.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   So this is an example where simple math,
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.000]   you know, linear algebra,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.920]   leads to deep physics.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.120]   Einstein's theory of special relativity,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.960]   motivated by this inconsistency
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.280]   that Maxwell's equation would suggest
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.120]   for the speed of light,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   depending on who observes it.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.760]   - What's the most daring idea there,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.920]   that the speed of light could be the same everywhere?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.720]   - That's the basic, that's the guts of it.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.120]   That's the core of Einstein's theory.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.520]   That statement underlies the whole thing.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.040]   Speed of light is the same for everybody,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.480]   it's hard to swallow,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.360]   and it doesn't sound right.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.320]   It sounds completely wrong on the face of it.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.960]   And it took Einstein to make this daring statement.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.560]   It would be laughing in some sense.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.520]   How could anybody make this possibly ridiculous claim?
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.720]   And it turned out to be true.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.880]   - How does that make you feel?
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.360]   'Cause it still sounds ridiculous.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.080]   - It sounds ridiculous until you learn
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.960]   that our intuition is at fault
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.560]   about the way we conceive of space and time.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.120]   The way we think about space and time is wrong,
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.360]   because we think about the nature of time as absolute.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.720]   And part of it is because we live in a situation
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.400]   where we don't go with very high speeds,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.960]   that our speeds are small compared to the speed of light,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.720]   and therefore the phenomena we observe
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.440]   does not distinguish the relativity of time.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.200]   The time also depends on who measures it.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.800]   There's no absolute time.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.920]   When you say it's noon today now,
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.380]   it depends on who's measuring it,
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.040]   and not everybody would agree with that statement.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.560]   And to see that, you would have to have fast observer
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.760]   moving close to the speed of light.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.800]   So this shows that our intuition is at fault.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.360]   And a lot of the discoveries in physics
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.680]   precisely is getting rid of the wrong old intuition.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.000]   And it is funny because we get rid of it,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.240]   but it always lingers in us in some form.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.020]   Like even when I'm describing it,
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.960]   I feel like a little bit like, isn't it funny?
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.480]   As you're just feeling the same way.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.800]   It is, it is.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.600]   But we kind of replace it by an intuition.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.440]   And actually there's a very beautiful example of this,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.040]   how physicists do this, try to replace their intuition.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.400]   And I think this is one of my favorite examples
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.240]   about how physicists develop intuition.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.000]   It goes to the work of Galileo.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.600]   So again, let's go back to Greek philosophers
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.520]   or maybe Aristotle in this case.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.560]   Now again, let's make a criticism.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.320]   He thought that objects, the heavier objects
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.000]   fall faster than the lighter objects.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.880]   - Makes sense.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.840]   - It kind of makes sense.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.960]   And people say about the feather and so on,
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.680]   but that's because of the air resistance.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.600]   But you might think like if you have a heavy stone
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.480]   and a light pebble, the heavy one will fall first.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.280]   If you don't do any experiments,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.480]   that's the first gut reaction.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.080]   I would say, everybody would say that's the natural thing.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.600]   Galileo did not believe this
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.920]   and he kind of did the experiment.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.680]   Famously it said he went on the top of Pisa Tower
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   and he dropped these heavy and light stones
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.840]   and they fell at the same time
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.040]   when he dropped it at the same time, from the same height.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.960]   Okay, good.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.400]   So he said, I'm done.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.680]   I've showed that the heavy and lighter objects
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.880]   fall at the same time, I did the experiment.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.480]   Scientists at that time did not accept it.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.800]   Why was that?
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.600]   Because at that time science was not just experimental.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.880]   The experiment was not enough.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.600]   They didn't think that they have to soil their hands
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.880]   in doing experiments to get to the reality.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.360]   They said, why is it the case?
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.200]   - Why?
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.400]   - So Galileo had to come up with an explanation
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.560]   of why heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.280]   This is the way he convinced them, using symmetry.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.160]   He said, suppose you have three bricks,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.160]   the same shape, the same size, same mass, everything.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.200]   And we hold these three bricks at the same height
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.920]   and drop them.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.160]   Which one will fall to the ground first?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.320]   Everybody said, of course, we know that symmetry
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.040]   tells you they're all the same shape,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.440]   same size, same height.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.960]   Of course they fall at the same time.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.880]   Yeah, we know that, next, next.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.080]   It's trivial.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.160]   He said, okay, what if we move these bricks around
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.000]   with the same height?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.360]   Does it change the time they hit the ground?
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.520]   They said, if it's the same height,
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.000]   again, by the symmetry principle,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.160]   because the height translation,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.000]   horizontal translation is the symmetry.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.280]   No, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.600]   They all fall at the same rate.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.880]   Good, doesn't matter how close I bring them together?
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.920]   No, it doesn't.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.040]   Okay, suppose I make the two bricks touch
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.880]   and then let them go.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.160]   Do they fall at the same rate?
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.640]   Yes, they do.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.960]   But then he said, well, the two bricks that touch
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.200]   are twice more mass than this other brick.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.680]   And you just agreed that they fall at the same rate.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.800]   They say, yeah, yeah, we just agreed.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.440]   That's right, that's great.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.480]   Yes, so he de-confused them by the symmetry reasoning.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.360]   So this way of repackaging some intuition,
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.880]   a different intuition.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.960]   When the intuitions clash,
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   then you side on the, you replace the intuition.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   - That's brilliant.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:31.320]   In some of these more difficult physical ideas,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.240]   physics ideas in the 20th century and the 21st century,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.160]   it starts becoming more and more difficult
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.000]   to then replace the intuition.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.880]   You know, what does the world look like
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   for an object traveling close to the speed of light?
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.960]   You start to think about like the edges
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.480]   of supermassive black holes.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.000]   And you start to think like, what's that look like?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.640]   Or I've been into gravitational waves recently.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.040]   It's like when the fabric of space-time
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.400]   is being morphed by gravity.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   Like what's that actually feel like?
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.860]   If I'm riding a gravitational wave, what's that feel like?
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:12.120]   I mean, I think some of those are more sort of hippie,
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.800]   not useful intuitions to have.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.760]   But if you're an actual physicist
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.600]   or whatever the particular discipline is,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.520]   I wonder if it's possible to meditate,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.680]   to sort of escape through thinking,
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.760]   prolonged thinking and meditation on a world,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.320]   like live in a visualized world that's not like our own
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.120]   in order to understand a phenomenon deeply.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.880]   So like replace the intuition
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.600]   like through rigorous meditation on the idea
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.360]   in order to conceive of it.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.720]   I mean, if we're talking about multiple dimensions,
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.600]   I wonder if there's a way to escape
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.960]   with a three-dimensional world in our mind
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.040]   in order to then start to reason about it.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.080]   The more I talk to topologists,
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:04.280]   the more they seem to not operate at all
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.720]   in the visual space.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.880]   They really trust the mathematics,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.400]   which is really annoying to me
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   because topology and differential geometry
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.040]   feels like it has a lot of potential
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.520]   for beautiful pictures.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.640]   - Yes, I think they do.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.320]   Actually, I would not be able to do my research
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.200]   if I don't have an intuitive feel about geometry.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.680]   And we'll get to it, as you mentioned before,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.120]   that how, for example, in string theory,
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.440]   you deal with these extra dimensions.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.480]   And I'll be very happy to describe how we do it
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.640]   because without intuition, we will not get anywhere.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.480]   And I don't think you can just rely on formalism.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.400]   I don't.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.120]   I don't think any physicist just relies on formalism.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.040]   That's not physics.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.720]   That's not understanding.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.120]   So we have to intuit it.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.280]   And that's crucial.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.320]   And there are steps of doing it, and we learned.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.880]   It might not be trivial, but we learned how to do it.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.560]   Similar to this Galileo picture I just told you,
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.440]   you have to build these gradually.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.920]   - You have to connect the bricks.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.000]   - You have to connect the bricks.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.800]   Exactly, you have to connect the bricks, literally.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.760]   So yeah, so then, going back to your question
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.080]   about the path of the history of the science,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.400]   so I was saying about the refusal of magnetism
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.600]   and the special relativity were simple idea
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.400]   led to special relativity,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.020]   but then he went further thinking about acceleration
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.760]   in the context of relativity,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.840]   and he came up with general relativity
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.720]   where he talked about the fabric of space-time being curved
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.640]   and so forth and matter affecting the curvature
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.520]   of the space and time.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.520]   So this gradually became a connection
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.580]   between geometry and physics.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.180]   Namely, he replaced Newton's gravitational force
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.000]   with a very geometrical beautiful picture.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.540]   It's much more elegant than Newton's,
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.980]   but much more complicated mathematically.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.780]   So when we say it's simpler,
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.020]   we mean in some form it's simpler,
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.780]   but not in pragmatic terms of equation solving.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.340]   The equations are much harder to solve in Einstein's theory,
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.920]   and in fact, so much harder that Einstein himself
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.020]   couldn't solve many of the cases.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.940]   He thought, for example, he couldn't solve the equation
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.800]   for a spherical symmetric matter,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.980]   like if you had a symmetric sun,
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.740]   he didn't think you can actually solve his equation for that
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.380]   and a year after he said that it was solved by Schwarzschild.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.020]   So it was that hard that he didn't think
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.940]   it's gonna be that easy.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.000]   So yeah, the formalism is hard,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.460]   but the contrast between the special relativity
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.060]   and general relativity is very interesting
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.540]   because one of them has almost trivial math
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.580]   and the other one has super complicated math.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.620]   Both are physically amazingly important.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.740]   And so we have learned that the physics
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.860]   may or may not require complicated math.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.620]   We should not shy from using complicated math
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.820]   like Einstein did.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.940]   Nobody, Einstein wouldn't say,
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.300]   I'm not gonna touch this math
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.700]   because it's too much tensors or curvature
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.380]   and I don't like the four dimensional space time
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.020]   because I can't see four dimension.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.140]   He wasn't doing that.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.520]   He was willing to abstract from that
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.660]   because physics drove him in that direction,
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.460]   but his motivation was physics.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.560]   Physics pushed him.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.980]   Just like Newton pushed to develop calculus
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.540]   because physics pushed him that he didn't have the tools.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.140]   So he had to develop the tools
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.020]   to answer his physics questions.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.780]   So his motivation was physics again.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.820]   So to me, those are examples which show
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.580]   that math and physics have this symbiotic relationship
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.900]   which kind of reinforce each other.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.120]   Here I'm giving you examples of both of them,
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.540]   namely Newton's work led to development
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   of mathematics calculus.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.680]   And in the case of Einstein,
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.800]   he didn't develop Riemannian geometry, just used them.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.360]   So it goes both ways.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.200]   And in the context of modern physics,
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.560]   we see that again and again, it goes both ways.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.960]   - Let me ask a ridiculous question.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.880]   You know, you talk about your favorite soccer player,
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.440]   the bar, I'll ask the same question about Einstein's ideas,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.640]   which is, which one do you think
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.520]   is the biggest leap of genius?
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.960]   Is it the E equals MC squared?
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.560]   Is it Brownian motion?
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.160]   Is it special relativity?
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.180]   Is it general relativity?
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.780]   Which of the famous set of papers he's written in 1905
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.740]   and in general, his work was the biggest leap of genius?
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.260]   - In my opinion, it's special relativity.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.140]   The idea that speed of light is the same for everybody
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.500]   is the beginning of everything he did.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.220]   - The beginning is the-- - The beginning.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.580]   - Once you embrace that weirdness, all the weirdness--
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.780]   - I would say that's, even though he says
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.740]   the most beautiful moment for him,
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.060]   he says that is when he realized
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.620]   that if you fall in an elevator,
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.700]   you don't know if you're falling
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.420]   or whether you're in the falling elevator
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.100]   or whether you're next to the Earth gravitational field,
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.800]   that to him was his aha moment,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.620]   which inertial mass and gravitational mass
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.460]   being identical geometrically and so forth
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.500]   as part of the theory, not because of,
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.280]   you know, some funny coincidence.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.380]   That's for him, but I feel from outside at least,
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.860]   it feels like the speed of light being the same
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.180]   is the really aha moment.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.160]   - The general relativity to you is not,
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.940]   like the conception of space-time.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.580]   - In a sense, the conception of space-time
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.620]   already was part of spatial relativity
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.900]   when you talk about length contraction.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.060]   So general relativity takes that to the next step,
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.460]   but beginning of it was already space-length contracts,
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.780]   time dilates, so once you talk about those,
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.740]   then yeah, you can dilate more or less different places
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.900]   than its curvature, so you don't have a choice.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.500]   So it's kind of started just with that same simple thought,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.660]   speed of light is the same for all.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.060]   - Where does quantum mechanics come into view?
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.580]   - Exactly, so this is the next step.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.820]   So Einstein's, you know, developed general relativity
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.500]   and he's beginning to develop the foundation
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.980]   of quantum mechanics at the same time,
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.260]   the photoelectric effects and others.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.740]   And so quantum mechanics overtakes, in fact,
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.600]   Einstein in many ways because he doesn't like
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.380]   the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.380]   and the formulas that's emerging,
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.320]   but physicists march on and try to, for example,
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.860]   combine Einstein's theory of relativity
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.060]   with quantum mechanics.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.080]   So Dirac takes special relativity,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.820]   tries to see how is it compatible with quantum mechanics.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.540]   - Can we pause and briefly say what is quantum mechanics?
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.860]   - Oh yes, sure, so quantum mechanics,
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.500]   so I discussed briefly when I talked about the connection
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.100]   between Newtonian mechanics and the Euler-Lagrange
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.340]   reformulation of the Newtonian mechanics
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.140]   and interpretation of this Euler-Lagrange formalism
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.620]   in terms of the paths that the particle take.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.500]   So when we say a particle goes from here to here,
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.100]   we usually think it classically,
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.340]   it follows a specific trajectory,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.560]   but actually in quantum mechanics,
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.020]   it follows every trajectory with different probabilities.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.940]   And so there's this fuzziness.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:49.300]   Now, most probable, it's the path that you actually see
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.860]   and the deviation from that is very, very unlikely
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.820]   and probabilistically very minuscule.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.380]   So in everyday experiment, we don't see anything deviated
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.040]   from what we expect.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.540]   But quantum mechanics tells us that things are more fuzzy,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.780]   things are not as precise as the line you draw.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.780]   Things are a bit like cloud.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.180]   So if you go to microscopic scales,
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.580]   like atomic scales and lower,
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.800]   these phenomena become more pronounced.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.300]   You can see it much better.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.380]   The electron is not at the point,
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.340]   but the clouds spread out around the nucleus.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.300]   And so this fuzziness, this probabilistic aspect of reality
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   is what quantum mechanics describes.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.640]   - Can I briefly pause on that idea?
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.780]   Do you think this is, quantum mechanics
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.080]   is just a really damn good approximation,
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.240]   a tool for predicting reality?
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.900]   Or does it actually describe reality?
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.840]   Do you think reality is fuzzy at that level?
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.460]   - Well, I think that reality is fuzzy at that level,
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.880]   but I don't think quantum mechanics
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.800]   is necessarily the end of the story.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.780]   So quantum mechanics is certainly an improvement
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.420]   over classical physics.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.220]   That much we know by experiments and so forth.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.240]   Whether I'm happy with quantum mechanics,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.660]   whether I view quantum mechanics, for example,
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.060]   the thought, the measurement description
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.980]   of quantum mechanics, am I happy with it?
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.780]   Am I thinking that's the end stage or not?
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:12.740]   I don't.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.340]   I don't think we're at the end of that story.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.460]   And many physicists may or may not view this way.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.980]   Some do, some don't.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.000]   But I think that it's the best we have right now.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.080]   That's for sure.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.400]   It's the best approximation for reality we know today.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.840]   And so far, we don't know what it is the next thing
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.520]   that improves it or replaces it and so on.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.080]   But as I mentioned before, I don't believe any
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.760]   of the laws of physics we know today
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.600]   are apparently exactly correct.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.440]   - It's the end of the story.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.040]   - And it doesn't bother me.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.440]   I'm not like dogmatic, saying, I have figured out,
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.560]   this is the law of nature, I know everything.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.840]   No, no.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.600]   That's the beauty about science, that we are not dogmatic.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.380]   And we are willing to, in fact, we are encouraged
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.940]   to be skeptical of what we ourselves do.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.420]   - So you were talking about Dirac.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.640]   - Yes, I was talking about Dirac, right.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.900]   So Dirac was trying to now combine
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.760]   this Schrodinger's equations, which was described
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.780]   in the context of trying to talk about how
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.860]   these probabilistic waves of electrons move for the atom,
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.740]   which was good for speeds which were not too close
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.980]   to the speed of light, to what happens when you get
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.860]   to the near the speed of light.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.460]   So then you need relativity.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.460]   So then Dirac tried to combine Einstein's relativity
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.700]   with quantum mechanics.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.740]   So he tried to combine them and he wrote
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.900]   this beautiful equation, the Dirac equation,
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.660]   which roughly speaking, take the square root
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.460]   of the Einstein's equation in order to connect it
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.300]   to Schrodinger's time evolution operator,
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.220]   which is first order in time derivative,
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.100]   to get rid of the naive thing that Einstein's equation
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.380]   would have given, which is second order.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.380]   So you have to take a square root.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.580]   Now square root usually has a plus or minus sign
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.500]   when you take it.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.780]   And when he did this, he originally didn't notice this,
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.600]   didn't pay attention to this plus or minus sign,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.940]   but later physicists pointed out to Dirac,
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.260]   says, look, there's also this minus sign.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.060]   And if you use this minus sign, you get negative energy.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.620]   In fact, it was very, very annoying that, you know,
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.660]   somebody else tells you this obvious mistake you make.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.840]   Pauli, famous physicist, told Dirac, this is nonsense.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.620]   You're gonna get negative energy with your equation,
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.460]   which negative energy without any bottom.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.500]   You can go all the way down to negative infinite energy,
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.140]   so it doesn't make any sense.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.220]   Dirac thought about it, and then he remembered
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.300]   Pauli's exclusion principle.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.320]   Just before him, Pauli had said, you know,
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.720]   there's this principle called the exclusion principle
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.420]   that two electrons cannot be on the same orbit.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.740]   And so Dirac said, okay, you know what?
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:37.740]   All these negative energy states are filled orbits,
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:38.980]   occupied.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.980]   So according to you, Mr. Pauli, there's no place to go,
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.220]   so therefore they only have to go positive.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   Sounded like a big cheat.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.000]   And then Pauli said, oh, you know what?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.900]   We can change orbits from one orbit to another.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.860]   What if I take one of these negative energy orbits
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.620]   and put it up there?
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.740]   Then it seems to be a new particle,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:03.220]   which has opposite properties to the electron.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.060]   It has positive energy, but it has positive charge.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.980]   What is that?
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.460]   Dirac was a bit worried.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.620]   He said, maybe that's proton,
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.540]   because proton has plus charge.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.820]   He wasn't sure.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.580]   But then he said, oh, maybe it's proton.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.860]   But then they said, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.420]   It has the same mass as the electron.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.340]   It cannot be proton, because proton is heavier.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.180]   Dirac was stuck.
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.080]   He says, well, then maybe another particle we haven't seen.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.780]   By that time, Dirac himself was getting a little bit
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.100]   worried about his own equation
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.600]   and his own crazy interpretation.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.160]   Until a few years later, Anderson,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.740]   in the photographic place that he had gotten
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:45.640]   from these cosmic rays, he discovered a particle
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.960]   which goes in the opposite direction that the electron goes
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.920]   when there's a magnetic field,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.360]   and with the same mass,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.200]   exactly like what Dirac had predicted.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.680]   And this was what we call now positron.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.320]   And in fact, beginning with the work of Dirac,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.240]   we know that every particle has an antiparticle.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.520]   And so this idea that there's an antiparticle
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.880]   came from this simple math.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.840]   There's a plus and a minus
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   from the Dirac's quote-unquote mistake.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.440]   So again, trying to combine ideas,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.120]   sometimes the math is smarter than the person
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   who uses it to apply it.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.920]   And we try to resist it, and then you're kind of confronted
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.100]   by criticism, which is the way it should be.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.940]   So physicists come and say, no, no, no, that's wrong,
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.860]   and you correct it, and so on.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.840]   So that is a development of the idea
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   there's particle, there's antiparticle, and so on.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.720]   So this is the beginning of development of quantum mechanics
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.440]   and the connection with relativity.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.900]   But the thing was more challenging,
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.760]   because we had to also describe
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.780]   how electric and magnetic fields work with quantum mechanics.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.200]   This was much more complicated,
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.760]   because it's not just one point.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.380]   Electric and magnetic fields were everywhere,
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.300]   so you had to talk about fluctuating and a fuzziness
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.320]   of electrical field and magnetic fields everywhere,
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.680]   and the math for that was very difficult to deal with.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.560]   And this led to a subject called quantum field theory.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.320]   Fields, like electric and magnetic fields,
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.080]   had to be quantum, had to be described also in a wavy way.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.280]   Feynman, in particular, was one of the pioneers,
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.100]   along with Schrodinger and others,
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.880]   to try to come up with a formalism to deal with fields,
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.800]   like electric and magnetic fields,
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.200]   interacting with electrons in a consistent quantum fashion,
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.960]   and they developed this beautiful theory,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.600]   quantum electrodynamics, from that.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.000]   And later on, that same formalism,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.760]   quantum field theory, led to the discovery
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.560]   of other forces and other particles,
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.840]   all consistent with the idea of quantum mechanics.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.720]   So that was how physics progressed,
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.560]   and so basically we learned that all particles
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.880]   and all the forces are in some sense
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.640]   related to particle exchanges.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.320]   And so, for example, electromagnetic forces
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   are mediated by a particle we call photon, and so forth.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.640]   And same for other forces that they discovered,
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.080]   strong forces and the weak forces.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.920]   So we got the sense of what quantum field theory is.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.880]   - Is that a big leap of an idea
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.240]   that particles are fluctuations in the field?
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.080]   Like the idea that everything is a field?
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.320]   Is the old Einstein, light is a wave,
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.480]   both a particle and a wave, kind of idea?
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.960]   Is that a huge leap in our understanding
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.400]   of conceiving the universe as fields?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.240]   - I would say so.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.720]   I would say that viewing the particles,
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.800]   this duality that Bohr mentioned
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.040]   between particles and waves,
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.080]   that waves can behave sometimes like particles,
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.400]   sometimes like waves, is one of the biggest leaps
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.820]   of imagination that quantum mechanics made physics do.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.480]   So I agree that that is quite remarkable.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.240]   - Is duality fundamental to the universe,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.200]   or is it just because we don't understand it fully?
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.460]   Like we'll eventually collapse into a clean explanation
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.960]   that doesn't require duality?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.440]   That a phenomena could be two things at once
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.400]   and both to be true?
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.960]   That seems weird.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.320]   - So in fact, I was going to get to that
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.360]   when we get to string theory,
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.000]   but maybe I can comment on that now.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.520]   Duality turns out to be running the show today,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.600]   is the whole thing that we are doing is string theory.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.820]   Duality is the name of the game.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.440]   So it's the most beautiful subject,
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.840]   and I want to talk about it.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.440]   - Let's talk about it in the context of string theory.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.160]   So do you want to take a next step into,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.680]   'cause we mentioned general relativity,
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.480]   we mentioned quantum mechanics,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.640]   is there something to be said about quantum gravity?
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.960]   - Yes, that's exactly the right point to talk about.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.480]   So namely, we have talked about quantum fields,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.760]   and I talked about electric forces,
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.720]   photon being the particle carrying those forces.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.600]   So for gravity, quantizing gravitational field,
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.200]   which is this curvature of space-time
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.580]   according to Einstein,
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.680]   you get another particle called graviton.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.980]   So what about gravitons?
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.440]   Should be there, no problem.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.160]   So then you start computing it.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.440]   What do I mean by computing it?
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.400]   Well, you compute scattering of one graviton
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.500]   off another graviton,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.480]   maybe with graviton with an electron and so on,
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.920]   see what you get.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.480]   Feynman had already mastered this quantum electrodynamics,
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.380]   he said, "No problem, let me do it."
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.200]   Even though these are such weak forces,
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.360]   the gravity is very weak,
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.680]   so therefore to see them,
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.080]   these quantum effects of gravitational waves
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.480]   was impossible, it's even impossible today.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.680]   So Feynman just did it for fun.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.080]   He usually had this mindset that I wanna do something
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.160]   which I will see in experiment,
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.240]   but this one, let's just see what it does.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.680]   And he was surprised because the same techniques
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.960]   he was using for doing the same calculations,
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.160]   quantum electrodynamics, when applied to gravity failed.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.300]   The formulas seemed to make sense,
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.560]   but he had to do some integrals,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.040]   and he found that when he does those integrals,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.200]   he got infinity, and it didn't make any sense.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.520]   Now, there were similar infinities in the other pieces,
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.920]   but he had managed to make sense out of those before.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   This was no way he could make sense out of it,
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.960]   he just didn't know what to do.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.560]   He didn't feel it's an urgent issue
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.800]   because nobody could do the experiment,
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.760]   so he was kind of said, "Okay, there's this thing,
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.360]   "but okay, we don't know how to exactly do it,
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.700]   "but that's the way it is."
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.120]   So in some sense, a natural conclusion
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.640]   from what Feynman did could have been like,
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.440]   gravity cannot be consistent with quantum theory,
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.600]   but that cannot be the case
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.000]   because gravity is in our universe,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.020]   quantum mechanics is in our universe,
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.600]   they're both together, somehow it should work.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.000]   So it's not acceptable to say they don't work together.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.400]   So that was a puzzle, how does it possibly work?
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.660]   It was left open.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.120]   And then we get to the string theory.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.880]   So this is the puzzle of quantum gravity,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.440]   the particle description of quantum gravity failed.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:45.820]   - So the infinity shows up, what do we do with infinity?
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.760]   Let's get to the fun part, let's talk about string theory.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.600]   - Yes.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:55.840]   - Let's discuss some technical basics of string theory.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.740]   What is string theory?
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.140]   What is a string?
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.080]   How many dimensions are we talking about?
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.720]   What are the different states?
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.960]   How do we represent the elementary particles
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.780]   and the laws of physics using this new framework?
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.840]   - So string theory is the idea
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.280]   that the fundamental entities are not particles,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.920]   but extended higher dimensional objects,
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.380]   like one dimensional strings, like loops.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.000]   These loops could be open, like the two ends,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.100]   like an interval or a circle without any ends.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:32.700]   So, and they're vibrating and moving around in space.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.880]   So how big they are?
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.620]   Well, you can of course stretch it and make it big,
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.620]   or you can just let it be whatever it wants.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.300]   It can be as small as a point
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.380]   because the circle can shrink to a point
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.940]   and be very light, or you can stretch it
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.060]   and becomes very massive,
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.220]   or it could oscillate and become massive that way.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.340]   So it depends on which kind of state you have.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.980]   In fact, the string can have infinitely many modes
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.900]   depending on which kind of oscillation it's doing.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.020]   Like a guitar has different harmonics,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.140]   string has different harmonics,
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.980]   but for the string, each harmonic is a particle.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.420]   So each particle will give you,
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.180]   ah, this is a more massive harmonic,
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.480]   this is a less massive.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.000]   So the lightest harmonic, so to speak, is no harmonics,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.820]   which means like the string shrunk to a point,
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.260]   and then it becomes like a massless particles
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.600]   or light particles like photon and graviton and so forth.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.620]   So when you look at tiny strings,
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.500]   which are shrunk to a point, the lightest ones,
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.660]   they look like the particles that we think of,
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.540]   they're like particles.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.100]   In other words, from far away, they look like a point.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:32.140]   But of course, if you zoom in,
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.060]   there's this tiny little circle that's there
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.060]   that's shrunk to almost a point.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.540]   - Should we be imagining,
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.540]   this is to the visual intuition,
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.720]   should we be imagining literally strings
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.120]   that are potentially connected as a loop or not?
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.640]   When you and when somebody outside of physics
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.920]   is imagining a basic element of string theory,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.080]   which is a string,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.740]   should we literally be thinking about a string?
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.560]   - Yes, you should literally think about string,
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.580]   but string with zero thickness.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.920]   - With zero thickness.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.720]   - So notice it's a loop of energy, so to speak.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.780]   If you can think of it that way.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.080]   And so there's a tension like a regular string.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.100]   If you pull it, you have to stretch it.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.180]   But it's not like a thickness,
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.800]   like you're made of something, it's just energy.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.680]   It's not made of atoms or something like that.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.800]   - But it is very, very tiny.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.640]   - Very tiny.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.680]   - Much smaller than elementary particles of physics.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.600]   - Much smaller.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.720]   So we think if you let the string to be by itself,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.260]   with the lowest state, there'll be like a fuzziness
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.840]   or a size of that tiny little circle,
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.340]   which is like a point, about, could be anything between,
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.400]   we don't know the exact size,
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.340]   but in different models have different sizes,
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.160]   but something of the order of 10 to the minus,
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.600]   let's say 30 centimeters.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.660]   So 10 to the minus 30 centimeters,
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.320]   just to compare with the size of the atom,
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.380]   which is 10 to the minus eight centimeters,
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.460]   is 22 orders of magnitude smaller.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.160]   So it's--
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.120]   - Unimaginably small, I would say.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:56.960]   - Very small.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.800]   So we basically think from far away,
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.920]   string is like a point particle.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.700]   And that's why a lot of the things that we learned
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.920]   about point particle physics
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.020]   carries over directly to strings.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.000]   So therefore there's not much of a mystery
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.940]   why particle physics was successful,
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.520]   because string is like a particle when it's not stretched.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.960]   But it turns out having this size,
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.200]   being able to oscillate, get bigger,
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.400]   turned out to be resolving this puzzles
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.660]   that Feynman was having in calculating his diagrams,
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.600]   and it gets rid of those infinities.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.440]   So when you're trying to do those infinities,
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.360]   the regions that give infinities to Feynman,
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.740]   as soon as you get to those regions,
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.040]   then this string starts to oscillate,
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.520]   and these oscillation structure of the strings
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.000]   resolves those infinities to find the answer at the end.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   So the size of the string,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.800]   the fact that it's one dimensional,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.680]   gives a finite answer at the end,
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.720]   resolves this paradox.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.080]   Now, perhaps it's also useful to recount
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.280]   of how string theory came to be.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.240]   Because it wasn't like somebody say,
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.800]   "Well, let me solve the problem of Einstein's,
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.040]   "solve the problem that Feynman had
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.440]   "with unifying Einstein's theory with quantum mechanics
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.080]   "by replacing the point by a string."
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.160]   No, that's not the way the thought process,
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.800]   the thought process was much more random.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.000]   Physicist, Veneziano in this case,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.920]   was trying to describe the interactions
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.120]   they were seeing in colliders, in accelerators.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.560]   And they were seeing that some process,
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.480]   in some process when two particles came together
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.760]   and joined together, and when they were separately,
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.500]   in one way, and the opposite way,
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.020]   they behave the same way.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.640]   In some way, there was a symmetry, a duality,
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.920]   which he didn't understand.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.960]   The particles didn't seem to have that symmetry.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.980]   He said, "I don't know what it is,
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:44.680]   "what's the reason that these colliders
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.700]   "and experiments we're doing seems to have the symmetry,
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.880]   "but let me write the mathematical formula
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.680]   "which exhibits that symmetry."
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.080]   He used gamma functions, beta functions, and all that,
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.580]   you know, complete math, no physics,
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.320]   other than trying to get symmetry out of his equation.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.100]   He just wrote down a formula
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.840]   as the answer for a process, not a method to compute it.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.120]   Just say, "Wouldn't it be nice if this was the answer?"
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:08.960]   - Yes.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.380]   - "Physicist looked at this formula,
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.400]   "hmm, that's intriguing, it has this symmetry, all right,
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.720]   "but what is this, where is this coming from?
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.440]   "Which kind of physics gives you this?"
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.280]   Said, "I don't know."
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.440]   (laughing)
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.020]   - Yeah. - A few years later,
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.520]   people saw that, oh, the equation that you're writing,
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.640]   the process that you're writing
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.800]   in the intermediate channels that particles come together
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.120]   seems to have all the harmonics.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.320]   Harmonics sounds like a string.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.680]   Let me see if what you're describing
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   has anything to do with the strings,
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.400]   and people try to see if what he's doing
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.400]   has anything to do with the strings.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.880]   Oh, yeah, indeed, if I study scattering of two strings,
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.840]   I get exactly the formula you wrote down.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.360]   That was the reinterpretation of what he had written
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.500]   in the formula as a string,
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.120]   but still had nothing to do with gravity.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.400]   It had nothing to do with resolving the problems
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.200]   of gravity with quantum mechanics.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.600]   It was just trying to explain a process
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.140]   that people were seeing in hadronic physics collisions.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.420]   So it took a few more years to get to that point.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:09.120]   They noticed that, physicists noticed that
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.240]   whenever you try to find the spectrum of strings,
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.420]   you always get a massless particle,
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.840]   which has exactly the properties
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.940]   that a graviton is supposed to have,
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.160]   and no particle in hadronic physics that had that property.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.740]   You are getting a massless graviton
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:25.720]   as part of the scattering without looking for it.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.520]   It was forced on you.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.760]   People were not trying to solve quantum gravity.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.880]   Quantum gravity was pushed on them.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.960]   I don't want this graviton, get rid of it.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.080]   They couldn't get rid of it.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.360]   They gave up trying to get rid of it.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.640]   Physicists said, Sherkin-Schwartz said, you know what?
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.300]   String theory is theory of quantum gravity.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.640]   They changed the perspective altogether.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.560]   We are not describing the hadronic physics.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.800]   We're describing this theory of quantum gravity.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:54.080]   - And that's when string theory probably got exciting,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.340]   that this could be the unifying theory.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.780]   - Exactly, it got exciting,
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.480]   but at the same time, not so fast.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.840]   Namely, it should have been fast, but it wasn't,
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.080]   because particle physics through quantum field theory
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.120]   were so successful at that time.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.560]   This is mid '70s.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.000]   Standard model of physics, electromagnetism
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.840]   and unification of electromagnetic forces
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.100]   with all the other forces were beginning to take place
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.400]   without the gravity part.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.900]   Everything was working beautifully for particle physics.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.160]   And so that was the shining golden age
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.240]   of quantum field theory and all the experiments,
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.800]   standard model, this and that, unification,
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.800]   and spontaneous symmetry breaking was taking place.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.040]   All of them was nice.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.320]   This was kind of like a side show
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.360]   and nobody was paying so much attention.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.000]   This exotic string is needed for quantum gravity.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.180]   Ah, maybe there's other ways.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.520]   Maybe we should do something else.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.920]   So, and yet, it wasn't paid much attention to.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.040]   And this took a little bit more effort
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:48.060]   to try to actually connect it to reality.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.080]   There were a few more steps.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.280]   First of all, there was a puzzle
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.960]   that you were getting extra dimensions.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.600]   String was not working well
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.800]   with three spatial dimensions at one time.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.140]   It needed extra dimension.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.520]   Now, there are different versions of strings,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.800]   but the version that ended up being related
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.300]   to having particles like electron, what we call fermions,
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.200]   needed 10 dimensions, what we call super string.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.060]   Now, why super?
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.900]   Why the word super?
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.360]   It turns out this version of the string,
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.100]   which had fermions, had an extra symmetry,
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.840]   which we call supersymmetry.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.960]   This is a symmetry between a particle and another particle
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.640]   with exactly the same properties,
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.640]   same mass, same charge, et cetera.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.080]   The only difference is that one of them
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.800]   has a little different spin than the other one.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.720]   And one of them is a boson.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.080]   One of them is a fermion because of that shift of spin.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.120]   Otherwise, they're identical.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.560]   So there was this symmetry.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.520]   String theory had this symmetry.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.360]   In fact, supersymmetry was discovered
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.440]   through string theory, theoretically.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.880]   So theoretically, the first place that this was observed
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.680]   when you were describing these fermionic strings.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.200]   So that was the beginning of the study of supersymmetry
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.160]   was via string theory.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.000]   And then it had remarkable properties
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.200]   that the symmetry meant and so forth
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.680]   that people began studying supersymmetry after that.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.580]   And that was a kind of a tangent direction
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.720]   at the beginning for string theory.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.920]   But people in particle physics started also thinking,
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.040]   oh, supersymmetry is great.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.880]   Let's see if we can have supersymmetry in particle physics
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.720]   and so forth.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.540]   Forget about strings.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.720]   And they developed on a different track as well.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.640]   Supersymmetry in different models
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.120]   became a subject on its own right,
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.280]   understanding supersymmetry and what does this mean.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.120]   Because it unified bosons and fermions,
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.040]   unifies some ideas together.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.120]   So photon is a boson, electron is a fermion.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.680]   Could things like that be somehow related?
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.660]   It was a kind of a natural kind of a question
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.920]   to try to kind of unify
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.080]   because in physics, we love unification.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.220]   Now, gradually string theory was beginning
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.680]   to show signs of unification.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.720]   It had graviton, but people found
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.500]   that you also have things like photons in them.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.080]   Different excitations of string behave like photons.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   Another one behave like electron.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.760]   So a single string was unifying all these particles
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.340]   into one object.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.380]   That's remarkable.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.560]   It's in 10 dimensions though.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.720]   It is not our universe
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.520]   because we live in three plus one dimension.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.600]   How could that be possibly true?
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.240]   So this was a conundrum.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.920]   It was elegant, it was beautiful,
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   but it was very specific
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.600]   about which dimension you're getting,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.040]   which structure you're getting.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.640]   It wasn't saying, oh, you just put D equals to four,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.540]   you'll get your space time dimension that you want.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.880]   No, it didn't like that.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.300]   It said, I want 10 dimensions and that's the way it is.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.680]   So it was very specific.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.300]   Now, so people try to reconcile this by the idea
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.000]   that maybe these extra dimensions are tiny.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.240]   So if you take three macroscopic spatial dimensions
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.440]   at one time and six extra tiny spatial dimensions,
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.760]   like tiny spheres or tiny circles,
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.960]   then it avoids contradiction with manifest fact
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.720]   that we haven't seen extra dimensions in experiments today.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.040]   So that was a way to avoid conflict.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.880]   Now, this was a way to avoid conflict,
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.280]   but it was not observed in experiments.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.580]   A string observed in experiments?
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.040]   No, because it's so small.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.040]   So it's beginning to sound a little bit funny.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.640]   Similar feeling to the way perhaps Dirac had felt
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.720]   about this positron, plus or minus.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.200]   You know, it was beginning to sound a little bit like,
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.960]   oh yeah, not only I have to have 10 dimension,
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.720]   but I have to also this and,
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.200]   and so conservative physicists would say,
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.380]   hmm, you know, I haven't seen these in experiments.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.900]   I don't know if they are really there.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.800]   Are you pulling my leg?
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.520]   Do you want me to imagine things that are not there?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.720]   So this was an attitude of some physicists
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.440]   towards string theory, despite the fact
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.660]   that the puzzle of gravity and quantum mechanics
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.920]   merging together work, but still was this skepticism.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.040]   You're putting all these things,
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.240]   like you want me to imagine there are these extra dimensions
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.040]   that I cannot see, uh-huh, uh-huh,
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.400]   and you want me to believe that string theory
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.080]   that you have not even seen in experiments are real,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.160]   uh-huh, okay, what else do you want me to believe?
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.400]   So this kind of beginning to sound a little funny.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.160]   Now, I will pass forward a little bit further.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.960]   A few decades later, when string theory
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.000]   became the mainstream of efforts to unify the forces
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.560]   and particles together, we learned
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.640]   that these extra dimensions actually solved problems.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.400]   They weren't a nuisance the way they originally appeared.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.000]   First of all, the properties of these extra dimensions
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.480]   reflected the number of particles we got in four dimensions.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.520]   If you took these six dimensions to have like six,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.000]   five holes or four holes, it changed the number of particles
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.440]   that you see in four dimensional space-time.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.000]   You get one electron and one muon if you had this,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.520]   but if you did the other J shape, you get something else.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.640]   So geometrically, you could get different kinds of physics.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.800]   So it was kind of a mirroring of geometry by physics
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.360]   down in the macroscopic space.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.760]   So these extra dimension were becoming useful.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.800]   Fine, but we didn't need extra dimensions
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.560]   to just write an electron in three dimensions.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.760]   We did, we wrote it, so what?
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.240]   Was there any other puzzle?
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.960]   Yes, there were.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.120]   Hawking.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.680]   Hawking had been studying black holes in mid '70s
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.800]   following the work of Bekenstein,
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.800]   who had predicted that black holes have entropy.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.240]   So Bekenstein had tried to attach the entropy
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.520]   to the black hole.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.820]   If you throw something into the black hole,
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.280]   the entropy seems to go down
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.960]   because you had something entropy outside the black hole
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.800]   and you throw it.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.120]   Black hole was unique, so the entropy did not have any,
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.460]   black hole had no entropy,
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.920]   so the entropy seemed to go down.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.000]   And so that's against the laws of thermodynamics.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   So Bekenstein was trying to say, no, no,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.120]   therefore black hole must have an entropy.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.320]   So he was trying to understand that.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.160]   He found that if you assign entropy to be proportional
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.200]   to the area of the black hole, it seems to work.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.600]   And then Hawking found not only that's correct,
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.360]   he found the correct proportionality factor
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.000]   of a factor of a one quarter of the area in Planck units
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.360]   is the correct amount of entropy.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.080]   And he gave an argument using
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.280]   quantum semi-classical arguments,
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.640]   which means basically using a little bit
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.880]   of quantum mechanics,
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.040]   because he didn't have the full quantum mechanics
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   of strength there, he could do some aspects
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.920]   of approximate quantum arguments.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.880]   So heuristic quantum arguments led
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.520]   to this entropy formula.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.760]   But then he didn't answer the following question.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.400]   He was getting a big entropy for the black hole.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.040]   The black hole with the size of the horizon
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.680]   of a black hole is huge, has a huge amount of entropy.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   What are the microstates of this entropy?
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.240]   When you say, for example, the gas has entropy,
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.800]   you count where the atoms are,
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.560]   you count this bucket or that bucket,
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.680]   there's an information about there and so on, you count them.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.840]   For the black hole, the way Hawking was thinking,
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   there was no degree of freedom,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.480]   you throw them in, and there was just one solution.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.680]   So where are these entropy?
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.040]   What are these microscopic states?
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.960]   They were hidden somewhere.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.360]   So later in string theory,
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.600]   the work that we did with my colleague Strominger,
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.520]   in particular, showed that these ingredients
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.360]   in string theory of black hole arise
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.080]   from the extra dimensions.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.280]   So the degrees of freedom are hidden
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.000]   in terms of things like strings,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.640]   wrapping these extra circles in these hidden dimensions.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.040]   And then we started counting how many ways,
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.160]   like the strings can wrap around this circle
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.960]   and the extra dimension or that circle,
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.480]   and counted the microscopic degrees of freedom.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.760]   And lo and behold, we got the microscopic degrees
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.760]   of freedom that Hawking was predicting four dimensions.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.200]   So the extra dimensions became useful
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.820]   for resolving a puzzle in four dimensions.
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.360]   The puzzle was, where are the degrees of freedom
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.680]   of the black hole hidden?
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.320]   The answer, hidden in the extra dimensions,
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.040]   the tiny extra dimensions.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.840]   So then by this time, it was beginning to,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.160]   we see aspects that extra dimensions
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.360]   are useful for many things.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.920]   It's not a nuisance, it wasn't to be kind of,
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.200]   you know, be shamed of,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.520]   it was actually in the welcome features.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.920]   New feature, nevertheless.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.560]   - How do you intuit the 10 dimensional world?
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.800]   So yes, it's a feature for describing certain phenomena,
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.380]   like the entropy in black holes,
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:10.660]   but what, you said that to you,
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:15.260]   a theory becomes real or becomes powerful
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.220]   when you can connect it to some deep intuition.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.580]   So how do we intuit 10 dimensions?
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:24.820]   - Yes, so I will explain how some of the analogies work.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.840]   First of all, we do a lot of analogies.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.020]   And by analogies, we build intuition.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.240]   So I will start with this example.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.820]   I will try to explain
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.500]   that if we are in 10 dimensional space,
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.260]   if we have a seven dimensional plane,
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.900]   an eight dimensional plane,
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.580]   we ask typically in what space do they intersect each other
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.700]   in what dimension?
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.020]   That might sound like,
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.540]   how do you possibly give an answer to this?
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.460]   So we start with lower dimensions.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.620]   We start with two dimensions.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.520]   We say, if you have one dimension and a point,
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.600]   do they intersect typically on a plane?
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.440]   The answer is no.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.980]   So a line, one dimensional, a point, zero dimension,
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.760]   on a two dimensional plane, they don't typically meet.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.400]   But if you have a one dimensional line,
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.540]   another line, which is one plus one on a plane,
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.620]   they typically intersect at a point.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.140]   Typically means if you're not parallel,
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.080]   typically they intersect at a point.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.480]   So one plus one is two.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.620]   And in two dimension,
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:23.020]   they intersect at a zero dimensional point.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.740]   So you see two dimension, one and one, two,
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.900]   two minus two is zero.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.560]   So you get point out of intersection.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.880]   Okay, let's go to three dimension.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.880]   You have a plane, two dimensional plane and a point.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.720]   Do they intersect?
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.860]   No, two and zero.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:39.400]   How about the plane and a line?
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   A plane is two dimensional and a line is one,
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.980]   two plus one is three.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.000]   In three dimension, a plane and a line meet at points,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.880]   which is zero dimensional.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.720]   Three minus three is zero.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.920]   Okay, so plane and a line intersect
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.080]   at a point in three dimension.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.000]   How about the plane and a plane in 3D?
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.180]   A plane is two and this is two, two plus two is four.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.060]   In 3D, four minus three is one,
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.100]   they intersect on a one dimensional line.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.540]   Okay, we're beginning to see the pattern.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.060]   Okay, now come to the question.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.140]   We're in 10 dimension, now we have the intuition.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.380]   We have a seven dimensional plane
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.540]   and an eight dimensional plane in 10 dimension.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.140]   They intersect on a plane.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.020]   What's the dimension?
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:16.860]   Well, seven plus eight is 15 minus 10 is five.
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:20.300]   We draw the same picture as two planes
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.520]   and we write seven dimension, eight dimension,
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.940]   but we have gotten the intuition
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.980]   from the lower dimensional one, what to expect.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.660]   It doesn't scare us anymore.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.220]   So we draw this picture.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.700]   We cannot see all the seven dimensions
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:36.240]   by looking at this two dimensional visualization of it,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.380]   but it has all the features we want.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:39.900]   It has, so we draw this picture,
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:40.840]   which is seven, seven,
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.660]   and they meet at the five dimensional plane,
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.620]   which is five.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.540]   So we have built this intuition.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:50.020]   Now, this is an example
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.860]   of how we've come up with intuition.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.260]   Let me give you more examples of it
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.860]   because I think this will show you
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.900]   that people have to come up with intuitions to visualize it.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.820]   Otherwise, we will be a little bit lost.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.940]   - So what you just described is kind of
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.260]   in these high dimensional spaces,
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:08.780]   focus on the meeting place of two planes
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.200]   in high dimensional spaces.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.040]   - Exactly.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.220]   How the planes meet, for example,
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.740]   what's the dimension of their intersection and so on.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.600]   So how do we come up with intuition?
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.560]   We borrow examples from lower dimensions,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.940]   build up intuition and draw the same pictures
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:24.780]   as if we are talking about 10 dimensions,
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.860]   but we are drawing the same as a two dimensional plane
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.260]   because we cannot do any better.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:32.580]   But our words change, but not our pictures.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.820]   - So your sense is we can have a deep understanding
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.220]   of reality by looking at its slices,
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.500]   at lower dimensional slices.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.780]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.180]   And this brings me to the next example I wanna mention,
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.440]   which is sphere.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.580]   Let's think about how do we think about the sphere?
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.140]   Well, the sphere is a sphere, you know,
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.460]   the round, nice thing.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.520]   But sphere has a circular symmetry.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.900]   Now, I can describe the sphere in the following way.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.540]   I can describe it by an interval,
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.980]   which is think about this going from the north of the sphere
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.380]   to the south.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.500]   And at each point, I have a circle attached to it.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.460]   So you can think about the sphere as a line
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.900]   with a circle attached with each point,
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:18.100]   the circle shrinks to a point at end points of the interval.
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.900]   So I can say, oh, one way to think about the sphere
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.300]   is an interval, where at each point on that interval,
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   there's another circle I'm not drawing.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.300]   But if you like, you can just draw it.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.220]   Say, okay, I won't draw it.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.500]   So from now on, there's this mnemonic.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.640]   I draw an interval when I wanna talk about the sphere,
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.260]   and you remember that the end points of the interval
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.300]   mean a strong circle, that's all.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.260]   And they say, yeah, I see, that's a sphere, good.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.300]   Now, we wanna talk about the product of two spheres.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.020]   That's four dimensional, how can I visualize it?
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.900]   Easy, you just take an interval and another interval,
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.340]   that's just gonna be a square.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.460]   A square is a four dimensional space?
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.620]   Yeah, why is that?
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:02.140]   Well, at each point on the square, there's two circles,
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.860]   one for each of those directions you drew.
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.100]   And when you get to the boundaries of each direction,
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.940]   one of the circles shrink on each edge of that square.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.700]   And when you get to the corners of the square,
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.660]   all both circles shrink.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.740]   This is a sphere times a sphere.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.460]   I have defined an interval.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.260]   I just described for you a four dimensional space.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.640]   Do you want a six dimensional space?
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.980]   No problem.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.780]   Take a corner of a room.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.140]   In fact, if you want to have a sphere times a sphere,
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.340]   times a sphere, times a sphere.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.180]   Take a cube.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:36.780]   A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.340]   Two sphere times another sphere, times another sphere,
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.860]   where three of the circles I'm not drawing for you.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.740]   For each one of those directions, there's another circle.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.860]   But each time you get to the boundary of the cube,
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.100]   one circle shrinks.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.780]   When the boundaries meet, two circles shrink.
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:51.940]   When three boundaries meet, all the three circles shrink.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.300]   So I just give you a picture.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.900]   Now, mathematicians come up with amazing things.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.740]   Like, you know what?
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.420]   I want to take a point in space and blow it up.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.940]   You know, these concepts like topology and geometry,
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.540]   complicated, how do you do?
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.380]   In this picture, it's very easy.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.860]   Blow it up in this picture means the following.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.300]   You think about this cube, you go to the corner
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.620]   and you chop off a corner.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:15.140]   Chopping off the corner replaces a point.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:15.980]   - Yeah.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.500]   - It replaces a point by a triangle.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.900]   That's called blowing up a point.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.820]   And then this triangle is what they call P2,
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.300]   projective two space.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:25.040]   But these pictures are very physical and you feel it.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.260]   There's nothing amazing.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.020]   I'm not talking about six dimension.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.500]   Four plus six is 10, the dimension of string theory.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.300]   So we can visualize it, no problem.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.260]   - Okay, so that's building the intuition
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.860]   to a complicated world of string theory.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.940]   Nevertheless, these objects are really small.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.340]   And just like you said,
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.220]   experimental validation is very difficult
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.340]   because the objects are way smaller
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.300]   than anything that we currently have the tools
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:53.300]   and accelerators and so on to reveal through experiment.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.260]   So there's a kind of skepticism
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.340]   that's not just about the nature of the theory
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.780]   because of the 10 dimensions as you've explained,
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.980]   but in that we can't experimentally validate it.
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.460]   And it doesn't necessarily, to date,
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.980]   maybe you can correct me,
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:12.020]   predict something fundamentally new.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:16.100]   So it's beautiful as an explaining theory,
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.200]   which means that it's very possible
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.900]   that it is a fundamental theory
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:22.580]   that describes reality and unifies the laws,
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.500]   but there's still a kind of skepticism.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:30.500]   And me from sort of an outside observer perspective
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.300]   have been observing a little bit of a growing cynicism
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.300]   about string theory in the recent few years.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.580]   Can you describe the cynicism about sort of,
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:45.580]   by cynicism I mean a cynicism about the hope for this theory
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.820]   of pushing theoretical physics forward?
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:50.820]   - Yes.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:53.980]   - Can you do describe why this is cynicism
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.020]   and how do we reverse that trend?
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.100]   - Yes, first of all,
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:02.100]   the criticism for string theory is healthy
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.620]   in a sense that in science,
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.260]   we have to have different viewpoints and that's good.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.180]   So I welcome criticism.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.420]   And the reason for criticism,
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.860]   and I think that is a valid reason,
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.860]   is that there has been zero experimental evidence
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.100]   for string theory.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.300]   That is, no experiment has been done
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.300]   to show that there's this little loop
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.100]   of energy moving around.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:28.540]   And so that's a valid objection and valid worry.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.220]   And if I were to say, you know what,
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.740]   string theory can never be verified or experimentally checked
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.460]   that's the way it is,
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.280]   they would have every right to say
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.860]   what you're talking about is not science.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.740]   Because in science,
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:42.380]   we will have to have experimental consequences and checks.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.580]   The difference between string theory
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:45.780]   and something which is not scientific
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.660]   is that string theory has predictions.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.660]   The problem is that the predictions we have today
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.420]   of string theory is hard to access
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.060]   by experiments available with the energies
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.660]   we can achieve with a colliders today.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.340]   It doesn't mean there's a problem with string theory,
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:01.620]   it just means technologically we're not that far ahead.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.300]   Now, we can have two attitudes.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.140]   You say, well, if that's the case,
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.300]   why are you studying this subject?
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.440]   Because you can't do experiment today.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.480]   Now, this is becoming a little bit more like mathematics
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.320]   in that sense.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.400]   You say, well, I want to learn,
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.680]   I want to know how the nature works
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.480]   even though I cannot prove it today
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.060]   that this is it because of experiments.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.480]   That should not prevent my mind not to think about it.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.320]   - That's right.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.260]   - So that's the attitude many string theorists follow
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.200]   that it should be like this.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.960]   Now, so that's an answer to the criticism,
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.320]   but there's actually a better answer
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.120]   to the criticism I would say.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.420]   We don't have experimental evidence for string theory,
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.300]   but we have theoretical evidence for string theory.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.640]   And what do I mean by theoretical evidence
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.900]   for string theory?
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.480]   String theory has connected
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.320]   different parts of physics together.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.660]   It didn't have to.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:52.180]   It has brought connections between part of physics,
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.600]   although, suppose you're just interested
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.760]   in particle physics.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.880]   Suppose you're not even interested in gravity at all.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.700]   It turns out there are properties
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.340]   of certain particle physics models
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:06.060]   that string theory has been able to solve using gravity,
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.200]   using ideas from string theory,
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.680]   ideas known as holography,
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.140]   which is relating something which has to do with particles
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:15.600]   to something having to do with gravity.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.760]   Why did it have to be this rich?
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.220]   The subject is very rich.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.000]   It's not something we were smart enough to develop.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:23.840]   It came at us.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.660]   As I explained to you,
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.720]   the development of string theory
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.080]   came from accidental discovery.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.760]   It wasn't because we were smart enough
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.840]   to come up with the idea,
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.360]   oh yeah, string of course has gravity in it.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.440]   No, it was accidental discovery.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.160]   So some people say it's not fair to say
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.100]   we have no evidence for string theory.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:41.280]   Graviton, gravity is an evidence for string theory.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.260]   It's predicted by string theory.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.840]   We didn't put it by hand, we got it.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.920]   So there's a qualitative check.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.080]   Okay, gravity is a prediction of string theory.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.480]   It's a postdiction because we know gravity existed.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.740]   But still, logically, it is a prediction
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.320]   because really we didn't know it had,
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.960]   that graviton that we later learned that,
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.720]   oh, that's the same as gravity.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.440]   So literally that's the way it was discovered.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.240]   It wasn't put in by hand.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.440]   So there are many things like that,
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.440]   that there are different facets of physics,
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.360]   like questions in condensed matter physics,
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.240]   questions of particle physics,
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.040]   questions about this and that have come together
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.160]   to find beautiful answers
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.020]   by using ideas from string theory
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:27.040]   at the same time as a lot of new math has emerged.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.640]   That's an aspect which I wouldn't emphasize
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.920]   as evidence to physicists necessarily,
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.800]   because they would say, "Okay, great, you got some math,
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.600]   "but what does it do with reality?"
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.680]   But as I explained, many of the physical principles
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.700]   we know of have beautiful math underpinning them.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:45.200]   So certainly leads further confidence
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.800]   that we may not be going astray,
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.200]   even though that's not the full proof as we know.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.280]   So there are these aspects that give further evidence
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.300]   for string theory, connections between each other,
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.240]   connection with the real world,
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.480]   but then there are other things that come about,
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.120]   and I can try to give examples of that.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.000]   So these are further evidences,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.840]   and these are certain predictions of string theory.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.880]   They are not as detailed as we want,
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.480]   but there are still predictions.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.920]   Why is the dimension of space and time three plus one?
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:20.160]   Say, I don't know, just deal with it, three plus one.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.320]   But in physics, we want to know why.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.480]   Well, take a random dimension from one to infinity.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.200]   What's your random dimension?
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:32.320]   A random dimension from one to infinity would not be four.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.600]   Eight would most likely be a humongous number,
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.440]   if not infinity.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.600]   I mean, if you choose any reasonable distribution,
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.320]   which goes from one to infinity,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.160]   three or four would not be your pick.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.860]   The fact that we are in three or four dimension
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.380]   is already strange.
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:50.880]   The fact that strings of story, I cannot go beyond 10,
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.700]   or maybe 11 or something.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.600]   The fact that there's this upper bound,
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.200]   the range is not from one to infinity,
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.700]   it's from one to 10 or 11 or whatnot.
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.720]   It already brings a natural prior,
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.080]   oh yeah, three or four is, you know,
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.160]   it's just on the average.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.120]   If you pick some of the compactifications,
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.000]   then it could easily be that.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.840]   So in other words, it makes it much more possible
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.040]   that it could be theory of our universe.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.200]   So the fact that the dimension already is so small,
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.960]   it should be surprising.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.400]   We don't ask that question.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.960]   We should be surprised,
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.000]   because we could have conceived of universes
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.400]   with our predimension.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.260]   Why is it that we have such a small dimension?
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:25.460]   That's number one.
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.220]   - So, oh, so good theory of the universe
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.580]   should give you an intuition of the why it's four,
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.580]   or three plus one.
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.620]   And it's not obvious that it should be,
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.200]   that that should be explained.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.540]   We take that as an assumption,
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.340]   but that's a thing that should be explained.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.020]   - Yeah, so we haven't explained that in string theory.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.420]   Actually, I did write a model within string theory
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:49.620]   to try to describe why we end up with three
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.520]   plus one space-time dimensions,
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.720]   which are big compared to the rest of them.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.000]   And even though this has not been,
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.240]   the technical difficulties to prove it is still not there,
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.640]   but I will explain the idea,
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.280]   because the idea connects to some other piece
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.280]   of elegant math, which is the following.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   Consider a universe made of a box, a three-dimensional box.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.280]   Or in fact, if we start in string theory,
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.280]   nine-dimensional box,
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:17.200]   because we have nine spatial dimensions at one time.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.240]   So imagine a nine-dimensional box.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.380]   So we should imagine the box of a typical size
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:25.620]   of the string, which is small.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.660]   So the universe would naturally start
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.640]   with a very tiny nine-dimensional box.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.400]   What do strings do?
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.980]   Well, strings go around the box
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.360]   and move around and vibrate and all that,
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.580]   but also they can wrap around one side of the box
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:41.380]   to the other, because I'm imagining a box
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.740]   with periodic boundary conditions,
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.580]   so what we call the torus.
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.940]   So the string can go from one side to the other.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.540]   This is what we call a winding string.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.400]   The string can wind around the box.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.180]   Now, suppose you now evolve the universe.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:58.540]   Because there's energy, the universe starts to expand,
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.220]   but it doesn't expand too far.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.320]   Why is it?
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.700]   Well, because there are these strings
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.880]   which are wrapped around from one side of the wall
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.060]   to the other.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.380]   When the universe, the walls of the universe are growing,
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.860]   it is stretching the string,
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.940]   and the strings are becoming very, very massive.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.660]   So it becomes difficult to expand.
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.100]   It kind of puts a halt on it.
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.420]   In order to not put a halt,
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.800]   a string which is going this way
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.220]   and a string which is going that way
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.980]   should intersect each other
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.420]   and disconnect each other and unwind.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.220]   So a string which winds this way
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.260]   and a string which winds the opposite way
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:36.980]   should find each other to reconnect
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.700]   and this way disappear.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:42.180]   So if they find each other and they disappear.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.620]   But how can strings find each other?
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.980]   Well, the string moves, and another string moves.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.460]   A string is one dimensional.
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.880]   One plus one is two, and one plus one is two,
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.660]   and two plus two is four.
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:57.000]   In four dimensional space time, they will find each other.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.780]   In a higher dimensional space time,
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.740]   they typically miss each other.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.580]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.180]   - So if the dimension were too big,
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.140]   they would miss each other.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.860]   They wouldn't be able to expand.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:08.140]   So in order to expand, they have to find each other,
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.260]   and three of them can find each other,
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.380]   and those can expand, and the other one would be stuck.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.580]   - So that explains why within string theory,
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.540]   these particular dimensions are really big
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.820]   and full of exciting stuff.
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:18.900]   - That could be an explanation.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:22.940]   That's a model we suggested with my colleague Brandenberger,
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.980]   but it turns out to be related to a deep piece of math.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.000]   You see, for mathematicians,
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.260]   manifolds of dimension bigger than four are simple.
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:35.040]   Four dimension is the hardest dimension for math,
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.020]   it turns out, and it turns out the reason it's difficult
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:39.840]   is the following.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.300]   It turns out that in higher dimension,
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.140]   you use what's called surgery in mathematical terminology
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:49.160]   where you use these two-dimensional tubes
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.380]   to maneuver them off of each other.
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:54.100]   So you have two plus two becoming four.
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.340]   In higher than four dimension,
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.140]   you can pass them through each other
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.900]   without them intersecting.
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.260]   In four dimension, two plus two
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:04.100]   doesn't allow you to pass them through each other,
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.220]   so the same techniques that work in higher dimension
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.180]   don't work in four dimension because two plus two is four.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.060]   The same reasoning I was just telling you
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.740]   about strings finding each other in four
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.100]   ends up to be the reason why four is much more complicated
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.300]   to classify for mathematicians as well.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.140]   So there might be these things.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.740]   So I cannot say that this is the reason
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.900]   that string theory is giving you three plus one,
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.340]   but it could be a model for it.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.260]   And so there are these kind of ideas
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.420]   that could underlie why we have three extra dimensions
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.760]   which are large and the rest of them are small.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.940]   But absolutely, we have to have a good reason.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.100]   We cannot leave it like that.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.200]   - Can I ask a tricky human question?
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:44.660]   So you are one of the seminal figures in string theory.
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.260]   You got the Breakthrough Prize.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.060]   You've worked with Edward Witten.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.100]   There's no Nobel Prize that has been given
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.280]   on string theory.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.380]   You know, credit assignment is tricky in science.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.020]   It makes you quite sad, especially big, like LIGO,
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:01.460]   big experimental projects
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.820]   when so many incredible people have been involved
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.880]   and yet the Nobel Prize is annoying
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.900]   in that it's only given to three people.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.020]   Who do you think gets the Nobel Prize
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.620]   for string theory at first?
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:16.620]   If it turns out that it,
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.040]   if not in full, then in part,
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.420]   is a good model of the way the physics
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.260]   of the universe works.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:28.700]   Who are the key figures?
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.100]   Maybe let's put Nobel Prize aside.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:31.940]   Who are the key figures?
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.060]   - Okay, I like the second version of the question.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.820]   I think to try to give a prize to one person
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.340]   in string theory doesn't do justice
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:39.860]   to the diversity of the subject.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.820]   That to me is--
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.100]   - So there was quite a lot of incredible people
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:43.940]   in the history of string theory.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.220]   - Quite a lot of people.
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:46.580]   I mean, starting with Venetiano,
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:48.180]   who wasn't talking about strings.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:50.420]   I mean, he wrote down the beginning of a string.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:51.980]   So we cannot ignore that for sure.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.860]   And so you start with that
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:56.140]   and you go on with various other figures and so on.
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:58.460]   So there are different epochs in string theory
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.380]   and different people have been pushing it.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.800]   So for example, the early epoch,
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.740]   we just told you people like Venetiano and Nambu
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.560]   and the Suskind and others were pushing it,
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.860]   Green and Schwartz were pushing it and so forth.
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.620]   So this was, or Sherrick and so on.
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:15.180]   So these were the initial periods of pioneers,
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.780]   I would say, of string theory.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.620]   And then there were the mid '80s
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:22.660]   that Edward Witten was the major proponent of string theory
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.820]   and he really changed the landscape of string theory
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.100]   in terms of what people do and how we view it.
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.300]   And I think his efforts brought a lot of attention
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.620]   to the community about high energy community
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.060]   to focus on this effort as the correct theory
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.480]   of unification of forces.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.120]   So he brought a lot of research as well as, of course,
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.420]   the first rate work he himself did to this area.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:47.040]   So that's in mid '80s and onwards and also in mid '90s
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040]   where he was one of the proponents
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.640]   of the duality revolution in string theory.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.240]   And with that came a lot of these other ideas
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.400]   that led to breakthroughs involving, for example,
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.920]   the example I told you about black holes and holography
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.920]   and the work that was later done by Maldacena
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.640]   about the properties of duality between particle physics
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.400]   and quantum gravity and the connections,
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:12.960]   deeper connections of holography and it continues.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.360]   And there are many people within this range
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.640]   which I haven't even mentioned.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.000]   They have done fantastic important things.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.520]   How it gets recognized I think is secondary in my opinion
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.720]   than the appreciation that the effort is collective.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.440]   That in fact, that to me is the more important part
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.260]   of science that gets forgotten.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:35.200]   For some reason, humanity likes heroes
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.440]   and science is no exception.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.520]   We like heroes, but I personally try to avoid that trap.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.840]   I feel in my work, most of my work is with colleagues.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.280]   I have much more collaborations than sole author papers
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.880]   and I enjoy it and I think that that's to me
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.360]   one of the most satisfying aspects of science
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:59.280]   is to interact and learn and debate ideas with colleagues
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.080]   because that influx of ideas enriches it
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.720]   and that's why I find it interesting.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.260]   To me, science, if I was in an island
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.400]   and if I was developing string theory by myself
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.800]   and had nothing to do with anybody,
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.160]   it would be much less satisfying in my opinion.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.180]   Even if I could take credit, I did it,
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.360]   it won't be as satisfying.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.200]   - Sitting alone with a big metal drinking champagne.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.760]   - No, I think to me the collective work is more exciting
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.320]   and you mentioned my getting the breakthrough.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.520]   When I was getting it, I made sure to mention
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.320]   that it is because of the joint work
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.800]   that I've done with colleagues.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.840]   At that time, it was around 180 or so collaborators
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.760]   and I acknowledged them in the webpage for them.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.160]   I write all of their names
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.720]   and the collaborations that led to this.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.560]   So to me, science is fun when it's collaboration
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.760]   and yes, there are more important
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.240]   and less important figures as in any field
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.320]   and that's true, that's true in string theory as well
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.940]   but I think that I would like to view this
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:56.960]   as a collective effort.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:00.520]   - So setting the heroes aside,
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:04.280]   the Nobel Prize is a celebration of,
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.760]   what's the right way to put it?
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.240]   That this idea turned out to be right.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.640]   (laughing)
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.760]   So like you look at Einstein didn't believe in black holes
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:17.840]   and then black holes got their Nobel Prize.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:22.080]   Do you think string theory will get its Nobel Prize,
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.800]   Nobel Prizes?
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.440]   If you were to bet money,
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.840]   if this was an investment meeting
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.000]   and we had to bet all our money,
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   do you think he gets the Nobel Prizes?
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.560]   - I think it's possible that none of the living physicists
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.000]   will get the Nobel Prize in string theory
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.040]   but somebody will.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.000]   (laughing)
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.600]   Because unfortunately, the technology available today
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.080]   is not very encouraging
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:46.280]   in terms of seeing directly evidence for string theory.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.120]   - Do you think it's ultimately boils down
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.640]   to the Nobel Prize will be given
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.280]   when there is some direct or indirect evidence?
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.760]   - There would be but I think that part
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:58.800]   of this breakthrough prize was precisely the appreciation
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.520]   that when we have sufficient evidence,
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.200]   theoretical as it is, not experiment,
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.240]   because of this technology lag,
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.960]   you appreciate what you think is the correct path.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.560]   So there are many people who have been recognized precisely
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.080]   because they may not be around
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.160]   when it actually gets experimented,
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.880]   even though they discovered it.
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.880]   So there are many things like that
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.520]   that's going on in science.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.640]   So I think that I would want to attach less significance
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.280]   to the recognitions of people.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.120]   And I have a second review on this,
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.600]   which is there are people who look at these works
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.520]   that people have done and put them together
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.000]   and make the next big breakthrough.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.820]   And they get identified with, perhaps rightly,
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:48.000]   with many of these new visions.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.400]   But they are on the shoulders of these little scientists
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.040]   which don't get any recognition.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.480]   You know, yeah, you did this little work.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.920]   Oh yeah, you did this little work.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:57.760]   Oh yeah, yeah, five of you.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.280]   Oh yeah, these showed this pattern.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.800]   And then somebody else, it's not fair.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.120]   To me, those little guys,
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.400]   which kind of like seem to do a little calculation here,
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.240]   a little thing there,
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.120]   which doesn't rise to the occasion
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.800]   of this grandiose kind of thing,
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.100]   doesn't make it to the New York Times headlines and so on,
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.080]   deserve a lot of recognition.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.400]   And I think they don't get enough.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.760]   I would say that there should be this Nobel Prize for,
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.920]   you know, they have these Doctors Without Borders,
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.080]   they're a huge group, they should do similar thing.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.400]   These String Theorists Without Borders,
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.320]   kind of everybody's doing a lot of work.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.040]   And I think that I would like to see
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.840]   that effort recognized.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.460]   - I think in the long arc of history,
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.080]   we're all little guys and girls
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.640]   standing on the shoulders of each other.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:44.560]   I mean, it's all going to look tiny in retrospect.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.940]   We celebrate the New York Times,
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:51.040]   you know, as a newspaper,
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:55.000]   or the idea of a newspaper in a few centuries from now
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.200]   will be long forgotten.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.680]   - Yes, I agree with that.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.000]   Especially in the context of string theory,
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.760]   we should have very long term view.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.960]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:05.400]   Just as a tiny tangent, we mentioned Edward Witten,
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.800]   and he, in a bunch of walks of life for me as an outsider,
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.560]   comes up as a person who is widely considered
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.480]   as like one of the most brilliant people
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.920]   in the history of physics,
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.520]   just as a powerhouse of a human.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   Like the exceptional places that a human mind can rise to.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.120]   - Yes.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.720]   - You've gotten a chance to work with him.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.560]   What's he like?
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.280]   - Yes, more than that, he was my advisor, PhD advisor.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.960]   So I got to know him very well,
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.520]   and I benefited from his insights.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.120]   In fact, what you said about him is accurate.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.320]   He's not only brilliant,
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:46.600]   but he's also multifaceted in terms of the impact
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.560]   he has had in not only physics, but also mathematics.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.920]   He's gotten the Fields Medal
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.480]   because of his work in mathematics,
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:57.480]   and rightly so, he has used his knowledge of physics
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:01.680]   in a way which impacted deep ideas in modern mathematics.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.000]   And that's an example of the power of these ideas
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]   in modern high energy physics and string theory,
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.640]   that the applicability of it to modern mathematics.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.360]   So he's quite an exceptional individual.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.560]   We don't come across such people a lot in history.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.720]   So I think, yes, indeed,
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.160]   he's one of the rare figures in this history of subject.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.520]   He has had great impact on a lot of aspects
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.360]   of not just string theory,
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.400]   a lot of different areas in physics,
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.760]   and also, yes, in mathematics as well.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.000]   So I think what you said about him is accurate.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.600]   I had the pleasure of interacting with him as a student,
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.440]   and later on as colleagues,
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.520]   writing papers together and so on.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.200]   - What impact did he have on your life?
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.080]   Like, what have you learned from him?
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.240]   If you were to look at the trajectory of your mind,
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.560]   of the way you approach science and physics and mathematics,
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.400]   how did he perturb that trajectory in a way?
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.620]   - Yes, he did, actually.
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:57.680]   So I can explain, because when I was a student,
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.160]   I had the biggest impact by him,
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.420]   clearly as a grad student at Princeton.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.080]   So I think that was a time
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.680]   where I was a little bit confused
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:08.800]   about the relation between math and physics.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.140]   I got a double major in mathematics and physics at MIT,
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.600]   because I really enjoyed both,
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.280]   and I liked the elegance and the rigor of mathematics,
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.180]   and I liked the power of ideas in physics
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.760]   and its applicability to reality
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.380]   and what it teaches about the real world around us.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:27.980]   But I saw this tension
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:31.540]   between rigorous thinking in mathematics
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.440]   and lack thereof in physics,
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.260]   and this troubled me to no end.
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.020]   I was troubled by that.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:40.140]   So I was at crossroads
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.200]   when I decided to go to graduate school in physics,
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.800]   because I did not like some of the lack of rigors
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.000]   I was seeing in physics.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.200]   On the other hand, to me,
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.920]   mathematics, even though it was rigorous,
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.840]   I'm thinking it sometimes were,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.040]   I didn't see the point of it.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.280]   In other words, when I see,
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.780]   when I, you know, the math theorem by itself
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.760]   could be beautiful, but I really wanted more than that.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.320]   I want to say, okay, what does it teach us
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.880]   about something else, something more than just math?
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.240]   So I wasn't that enamored with just math,
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.320]   but physics was a little bit bothersome.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.960]   Nevertheless, I decided to go to physics,
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.840]   and I decided to go to Princeton,
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.280]   and I started working with Edward Witten
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.920]   as my thesis advisor.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:20.480]   And at that time, I was trying to put physics
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.400]   in rigorous mathematical terms.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.840]   I took quantum field theory,
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.800]   I tried to make rigorous out of it, and so on.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.080]   And no matter how hard I was trying,
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.760]   I was not being able to do that,
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.800]   and I was falling behind from my classes.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.680]   I was not learning much physics,
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.000]   and I was not making it rigorous.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.600]   And to me, it was this dichotomy between math and physics.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.440]   What am I doing?
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.980]   I like math, but this is not exactly rigorous.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:47.520]   There comes Edward Witten as my advisor,
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.080]   and I see him in action, thinking about math and physics.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.680]   He was amazing in math.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:54.920]   He knew all about the math.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.280]   It was no problem with him.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.600]   But he thought about physics in a way
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.640]   which did not find this tension between the two.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.080]   It was much more harmonious.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.520]   For him, he would draw the Feynman diagrams,
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.920]   but he wouldn't view it as a formalism.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.580]   He was viewed, oh yeah, the particle goes over there,
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.520]   and this is what's going on.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.000]   And I said, wait, you're thinking,
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.320]   really, is this particle, this is really electron
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.160]   going there, oh yeah, yeah.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.840]   It's not the formal rules of perturbation.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:19.920]   No, no, no.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.160]   You just feel like the electron,
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.040]   you're moving with this guy and do that, and so on,
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.840]   and you're thinking invariantly about physics,
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.760]   or the way he thought about relativity.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.840]   Like, I was thinking about this momentum system.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.500]   He was thinking invariantly about physics,
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.000]   just like the way you think about invariant concepts
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.480]   in relativity, which don't depend on the frame of reference.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.840]   He was thinking about the physics in invariant ways,
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.940]   the way that gives you a bigger perspective.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.480]   So this gradually helped me appreciate
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:50.200]   that interconnections between ideas and physics
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.760]   replaces mathematical rigor.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.360]   That the different facets reinforce each other.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.560]   You say, oh, I cannot rigorously define
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.400]   what I mean by this, but this thing connects
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.920]   with this other physics I've seen, and this other thing,
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.360]   and they together form an elegant story.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.760]   And that replaced for me what I believed as a solidness,
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:13.000]   which I found in math as a rigor, solid.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.160]   I found that replaced the rigor and solidness in physics.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.200]   So I found, okay, that's the way you can hang on to.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.320]   It is not wishy-washy.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.200]   It's not like somebody is just not being able to prove it,
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.720]   just making up a story.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.960]   It was more than that,
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.480]   and it was no tension with mathematics.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.720]   In fact, mathematics was helping it, like friends.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.820]   And so much more harmonious and gives insights to physics.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:36.640]   So that's, I think, one of the main things I learned
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:38.680]   from interactions with Witten.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.880]   And I think that now perhaps I have taken
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.480]   that to a far extreme.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.080]   Maybe he wouldn't go this far as I have.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.600]   Namely, I use physics to define new mathematics
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.960]   in a way which would be far less rigorous
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.400]   than a physicist might necessarily believe,
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.720]   because I take the physical intuition,
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.880]   perhaps literally in many ways, that could teach us math.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.360]   So now I've gained so much confidence in physical intuition
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.240]   that I make bold statements that sometimes
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.440]   takes math friends off guard.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.880]   So an example of it is mirror symmetry.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.440]   So we were studying these compactification
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.800]   of string geometries.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.760]   This is after my PhD now.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.560]   By the time I'd come to Harvard,
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.680]   we were studying these aspects of string compactification
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.520]   on these complicated manifolds, six-dimensional spaces,
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.080]   called Calabi-Yau manifolds, very complicated.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:31.140]   And I noticed with a couple other colleagues
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:35.220]   that there was a symmetry in physics suggested
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.600]   between different Calabi-Yau's.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.400]   It suggested that you couldn't actually compute
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.560]   the Euler characteristic of a Calabi-Yau.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.560]   Euler characteristic is counting the number of points
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.440]   minus the number of edges plus the number of faces minus.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.520]   So you can count the alternating sequence
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.800]   of properties of the space,
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.720]   which is the topological property of a space.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.680]   So Euler characteristic of the Calabi-Yau
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:57.920]   was a property of the space.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.600]   And so we noticed that from the physics formalism,
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.520]   if string moves in a Calabi-Yau, you cannot distinguish,
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.360]   we cannot compute the Euler characteristic.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.280]   You can only compute the absolute value of it.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.360]   Now this bothered us because how could you not compute
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.280]   the actual sign unless the both sides were the same?
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.120]   So I conjectured maybe for every Calabi-Yau
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.360]   with the Euler characteristic is positive,
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.600]   there's one with negative.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.360]   I told this to my colleague Yao,
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.480]   whose namesake is Calabi-Yau,
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.880]   that I'm making this conjecture.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.640]   Is it possible that for every Calabi-Yau,
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.560]   there's one with the opposite Euler characteristic?
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.840]   Sounds not reasonable.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.680]   I said, why?
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.320]   He said, well, we know more Calabi-Yau's
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.820]   with negative Euler characteristics than positive.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.520]   I said, but physics says we cannot distinguish them,
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.840]   at least I don't see how.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.480]   So we conjectured that for every Calabi-Yau
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.720]   with one sign, there's the other one,
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.080]   despite the mathematical evidence,
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.720]   despite the mathematical evidence,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.520]   despite the expert telling us it's not the right idea.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.080]   A few years later, this symmetry, mirror symmetry
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.520]   between the sign with the opposite sign
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.960]   was later confirmed by mathematicians.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.200]   So this is actually the opposite view.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.560]   That is, physics is so sure about it
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.720]   that you're going against the mathematical wisdom,
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:15.400]   telling them they better look for it.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.360]   - So taking the physical intuition literally
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.080]   and then having that drive the mathematics.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.000]   - Exactly, and by now we are so confident
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.160]   about many such examples
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.320]   that has affected modern mathematics in ways like this,
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.600]   that we are much more confident
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.920]   about our understanding of what string theory is.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.520]   These are other aspects of why
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.560]   we feel string theory is correct.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.880]   It's doing these kinds of things.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.640]   - I've been hearing your talk quite a bit
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:46.000]   about string theory, landscape and the swampland.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.840]   What the heck are those two concepts?
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840]   - Okay, very good question.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.920]   So let's go back to what I was describing about Feynman.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.800]   Feynman was trying to do these diagrams for graviton
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.280]   and electrons and all that.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.040]   He found that he's getting infinities he cannot resolve.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.040]   Okay, the natural conclusion is that field theories
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.560]   and gravity and quantum theory don't go together
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.600]   and he cannot have it.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.240]   So in other words, field theories and gravity
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.160]   are inconsistent with quantum mechanics, period.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.320]   String theory came up with examples,
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.720]   but didn't address the question more broadly
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.080]   that is it true that every field theory
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.780]   can be coupled to gravity in a quantum mechanical way?
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.640]   It turns out that Feynman was essentially right.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.200]   Almost all particle physics theories,
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.520]   no matter what you add to it,
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.320]   when you put gravity in it, doesn't work.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.440]   Only rare exceptions work.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.160]   So string theory are those rare exceptions.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.040]   So therefore the general principle
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.800]   that Feynman found was correct.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.620]   Quantum field theory and gravity
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.880]   and quantum mechanics don't go together,
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.780]   except for Joule's exceptional cases.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.400]   There are exceptional cases.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.200]   Okay, the total vastness of quantum field theories
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.320]   that are there, we call the set of quantum field theories,
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320]   possible things.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.300]   Which ones can be consistently coupled to gravity?
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:13.160]   We call that subspace the landscape.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.200]   The rest of them, we call the swampland.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.000]   It doesn't mean they are bad quantum field theories,
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.960]   they are perfectly fine.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.880]   But when you couple them to gravity,
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.200]   they don't make sense, unfortunately.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.940]   And it turns out that the ratio of them,
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.720]   the number of theories which are consistent with gravity
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.320]   to the ones which are without,
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.960]   the ratio of the area of the landscape
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.780]   to the swampland, in other words, is measure zero.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:40.240]   - So the swampland is infinitely large?
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.640]   - The swampland is infinitely large.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.200]   So let me give you one example.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.480]   Take a theory in four dimension with matter,
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.880]   with maximum amount of supersymmetry.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.680]   Can you get, it turns out a theory in four dimension
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.800]   with maximum amount of supersymmetry
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.660]   is characterized just with one thing, a group.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.360]   What we call the gauge group.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.500]   Once you pick a group, you have to find the theory.
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.120]   Okay, so does every group make sense?
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.480]   As far as quantum field theory, every group makes sense.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.580]   There are infinitely many groups,
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:10.680]   there are infinitely many quantum field theories.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.760]   But it turns out there are only finite number of them
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.840]   which are consistent with gravity out of that same list.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:19.420]   So you can take any group but only finite number of them,
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:22.680]   the ones who's what we call the rank of the group,
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.200]   the ones whose rank is less than 23.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:29.720]   Any one bigger than rank 23 belongs to the swampland.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.220]   There are infinitely many of them.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.100]   They're beautiful field theories
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.760]   but not when you include gravity.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:37.760]   So then this becomes a hopeful thing.
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.920]   So in other words, in our universe, we have gravity.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:44.660]   Therefore, we are part of that jewel subset.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:50.240]   Now, is this jewel subset small or large?
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.520]   It turns out that subset is humongous
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.280]   but we believe still finite.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.440]   The set of possibilities is infinite
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.320]   but the set of consistent ones,
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.320]   I mean, the set of quantum field theories are infinite
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.180]   but the consistent ones are finite but humongous.
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:10.120]   The fact that they're humongous
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.320]   is the problem we are facing in string theory
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.600]   because we do not know which one of these possibilities
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.200]   the universe we live in.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.420]   If we knew, we could make more specific predictions
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.440]   about our universe.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.400]   We don't know.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.560]   And that is one of the challenges when string theory,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:26.080]   which point on the landscape,
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.700]   which corner of this landscape do we live in?
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.160]   We don't know.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.820]   So what do we do?
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:35.720]   Well, there are principles that are beginning to emerge.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.080]   So I will give you one example of it.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.760]   You look at the patterns of what you're getting
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.000]   in terms of these good ones,
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.420]   the ones which are in the landscape
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:45.560]   compared to the ones which are not.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.620]   You find certain patterns.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.020]   I'll give you one pattern.
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:52.700]   You find in all the ones that you get from string theory,
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:55.560]   gravitational force is always there,
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:58.600]   but it's always, always the weakest force.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.800]   However, you could easily imagine field theories
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.720]   for which gravity is not the weakest force.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.960]   For example, take our universe.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.680]   If you take mass of the electron,
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.080]   if you increase the mass of electron by a huge factor,
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.040]   the gravitational attraction of the electrons
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:17.840]   will be bigger than the electric repulsion
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.440]   between two electrons,
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.700]   and the gravity will be stronger, that's all.
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:25.080]   It happens that it's not the case in our universe
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.620]   because electron is very tiny in mass compared to that.
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.920]   Just like our universe, gravity is the weakest force.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:33.840]   We find in all these other ones
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.180]   which are part of the good ones,
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.940]   the gravity is the weakest force.
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:40.720]   This is called the weak gravity conjecture.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.680]   We conjecture that all the points in the landscape
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:44.760]   have this property.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.680]   Our universe being just an example of it.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.520]   So there are these qualitative features
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.920]   that we are beginning to see.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.320]   But how do we argue for this?
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.960]   Just by looking patterns?
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.760]   Just by looking string theory has this?
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.960]   No, that's not enough.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:01.840]   We need more better reasoning, and it turns out there is.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.040]   The reasoning for this turns out to be studying black holes.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:09.520]   Ideas of black holes turn out to put certain restrictions
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:12.040]   of what a good quantum field theory should be.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.480]   It turns out using black hole,
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.600]   the fact that the black holes evaporate,
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.120]   the fact that the black holes evaporate
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.560]   gives you a way to check the relation
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.880]   between the mass and the charge of elementary particle.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.520]   Because what you can do, you can take a charged particle
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.480]   and throw it into a charged black hole
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.040]   and wait it to evaporate.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.440]   And by looking at the properties of evaporation,
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.240]   you find that if it cannot evaporate,
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:39.500]   particles whose mass is less than their charge,
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:40.800]   then it will never evaporate.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.120]   You will be stuck.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.520]   And so the possibility of a black hole evaporation
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.600]   forces you to have particles
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.720]   whose mass is sufficiently small
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.480]   so that the gravity is weaker.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.920]   So you connect this fact to the other fact.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.040]   So we begin to find different facts
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.320]   that reinforce each other.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.360]   So different parts of the physics reinforce each other.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.360]   And once they all kind of come together,
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.260]   you believe that you're getting the principle correct.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.560]   So weak gravity conjecture
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.480]   is one of the principles we believe in
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:09.760]   as a necessity of these conditions.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.280]   So these are the predictions strictly you're making.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.120]   Is that enough?
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.680]   Well, it's qualitative.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.160]   It's a semi-quantity.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.600]   It's just that mass of the electron
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.560]   should be less than some number.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.040]   But that number is, if I call that number one,
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.200]   the mass of the electron turns out
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.640]   to be 10 to the minus 20 actually.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.800]   So it's much less than one.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.000]   It's not one.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.240]   But on the other hand,
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.640]   there's a similar reasoning
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:34.020]   for a big black hole in our universe.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.460]   And if that evaporation should take place,
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.520]   gives you another restriction,
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.280]   tells you the mass of the electron
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.120]   is bigger than 10 to the,
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.200]   is now in this case, bigger than something.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.760]   It shows bigger than 10 to the minus 30 in the Planck unit.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.420]   So you find, aha,
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.400]   the mass of the electron should be less than one,
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.320]   but bigger than 10 to the minus 30.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.160]   In our universe,
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.440]   the mass of the electron is 10 to the minus 20.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.040]   Okay, now this kind of, you could call postdiction,
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.160]   but I would say it follows from principles
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.920]   that we now understand from string theory, first principle.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:05.840]   So we are beginning to make these kinds of predictions,
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.400]   which are very much connected
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.120]   to aspects of particle physics that we didn't think
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.260]   are related to gravity.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:14.960]   We thought, just take any electron mass you want.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:15.800]   What's the problem?
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.360]   It has a problem with gravity.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.360]   - And so that conjecture has also a happy consequence
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.700]   that it explains that our universe,
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:27.040]   like why the heck is gravity so weak?
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.580]   There's a force and that's not only an accident,
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:32.320]   but almost a necessity
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:35.320]   if these forces are to coexist effectively.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:38.240]   - Exactly, so that's the reinforcement
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.720]   of what we know in our universe,
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:43.260]   but we are finding that as a general principle.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:46.360]   So we want to know what aspects of our universe
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:47.880]   is forced on us,
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.680]   like the weak gravity conjecture and other aspects.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.720]   How much of them do we understand?
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.760]   Can we have particles lighter than neutrinos?
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:56.320]   Or maybe that's not possible.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.400]   You see, the neutrino mass,
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.600]   it turns out to be related to dark energy
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.640]   in a mysterious way.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:04.400]   Naively, there's no relation between dark energy
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.520]   and the mass of a particle.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.560]   We have found arguments
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.020]   from within the swampland kind of ideas
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.640]   why it has to be related.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.280]   And so there are beginning to be these connections
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.920]   between consistency of quantum gravity
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:22.320]   and aspects of our universe gradually being sharpened.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.180]   But we are still far from a precise quantitative prediction
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.840]   like we have to have such and such,
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.880]   but that's the hope,
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.520]   that we are going in that direction.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.000]   - Coming up with a theory of everything
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.200]   that unifies general relativity and quantum field theories
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.880]   is one of the big dreams of human civilization,
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.400]   us descendants of apes wondering about how this world works.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:44.840]   So a lot of people dream.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:50.920]   What are your thoughts about sort of other out there ideas,
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.760]   theories of everything,
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:56.120]   or unifying theories?
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.420]   So there's a quantum loop gravity.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:02.360]   There's also more sort of,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.280]   like a friend of mine, Eric Weinstein,
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:07.560]   beginning to propose something called geometric unity.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.060]   So these kinds of attempts,
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.760]   whether it's through mathematical physics
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.480]   or through other avenues,
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.760]   or with Stephen Wolfram,
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.120]   a more computational view of the universe.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.680]   Again, in his case,
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.480]   it's these hypergraphs that are very tiny objects as well,
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.640]   similarly a string theory,
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.760]   in trying to grapple with this world.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.840]   What do you think,
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:29.200]   is there any of these theories
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.160]   that are compelling to you,
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.480]   that are interesting,
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.480]   that may turn out to be true,
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:36.200]   or at least may turn out to contain ideas that are useful?
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.280]   - Yes, I think the latter.
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.720]   I would say that the containing ideas that are true,
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.560]   is my opinion,
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560]   was what some of these ideas might be.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.680]   For example, loop quantum gravity,
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:47.880]   is to me not a complete theory of gravity in any sense,
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:50.320]   but they have some nuggets of truth in them.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.960]   And typically what I expect happen,
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:55.720]   and I have seen examples of this within string theory,
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.960]   aspects which we didn't think are part of string theory
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:58.840]   come to be part of it.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.840]   For example, I'll give you one example.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:03.320]   String was believed to be 10 dimensional.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.960]   And then there was this 11 dimensional super gravity.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.120]   Nobody know what the heck is that.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.040]   Why are we getting 11 dimensional super gravity,
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.720]   where a string is saying it should be 10 dimensional?
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.880]   11 was the maximum dimension you can have a super gravity,
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:18.000]   but string was saying, sorry, we're 10 dimensional.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.520]   So for a while we thought that theory is wrong,
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.400]   because how could it be?
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.380]   Because string theory is definitely a theory of everything.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.440]   We later learned that one of the circles
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.520]   of string theory itself was tiny.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.240]   That we had not appreciated that fact.
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:32.200]   And we discovered by doing thought experiments
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.000]   in string theory, that there's gotta be an extra circle,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.400]   and that circle is connected
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.360]   to an 11 dimensional perspective.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.680]   And that's what later on got called M-theory.
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:44.000]   So there are these kinds of things that,
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.880]   we do not know what exactly string theory is,
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:47.400]   we're still learning.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.520]   So we do not have a final formulation of string theory.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.380]   It's very well could be that different facets
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.940]   of different ideas come together,
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.320]   like loop quantum gravity or whatnot.
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:56.840]   But I wouldn't put them on par.
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.080]   Namely, loop quantum gravity is a scatter of ideas
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:03.800]   about what happens to space when they get very tiny.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.480]   For example, you replace things by discrete data
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.720]   and try to quantize it and so on.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.520]   And it sounds like a natural idea to quantize space.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.220]   If you were naively trying to do quantum space,
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:17.320]   you might think about trying to take points
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:20.200]   and put them together in some discrete fashion,
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.040]   in some way that is reminiscent of loop quantum gravity.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.020]   String theory is more subtle than that.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.160]   For example, I would just give you an example.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:31.240]   And this is the kind of thing that we didn't put in by hand,
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.460]   we got it out.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.880]   And so it's more subtle than,
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.840]   so what happens if you squeeze the space
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.800]   to be smaller and smaller?
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:41.080]   Well, you think that after a certain distance,
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:43.440]   the notion of distance should break down.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.740]   When it goes smaller than Planck scale, should break down.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.680]   What happens in string theory?
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.200]   We do not know the full answer to that,
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.160]   but we know the following.
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.160]   Namely, if you take a space
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.600]   and bring it smaller and smaller,
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.600]   if the box gets smaller than the Planck scale
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.520]   by a factor of 10,
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:04.040]   it is equivalent by the duality transformation
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.840]   to a space which is 10 times bigger.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:10.080]   So there's a symmetry called T-duality
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:12.480]   which takes L to one over L.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:14.420]   Well, L is measured in Planck units
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.280]   or more precisely, string units.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.520]   This inversion is a very subtle effect.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.660]   And I would not have been,
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:23.400]   or any physicist would not have been able to design
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.060]   a theory which has this property,
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:27.160]   that when you make the space smaller,
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.440]   it is as if you're making it bigger.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:32.480]   That means there is no experiment you can do
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:34.860]   to distinguish the size of the space.
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:35.720]   This is remarkable.
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:37.760]   For example, Einstein would have said,
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.400]   of course I can measure the size of the space.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.240]   What do I do?
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.000]   Well, I take a flashlight, I send the light around,
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.340]   measure how long it takes for the light
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.020]   to go around the space and bring back
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:48.800]   and find the radius or circumference of the universe.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.700]   What's the problem?
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:52.760]   I said, well, suppose you do that and you shrink it.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.000]   He said, well, it gets smaller and smaller.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:54.840]   So what?
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.840]   I said, well, it turns out in string theory,
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.300]   there are two different kinds of photons.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:03.480]   One photon measures one over L, the other one measures L.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.520]   And so this duality reformulates.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.080]   And when the space gets smaller, it says,
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.720]   oh no, you better use the bigger perspective
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.020]   because the smaller one is harder to deal with.
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:13.880]   So you do this one.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:16.120]   So these examples of loop quantum gravity
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.240]   have none of these features.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.640]   These features that I'm telling you about,
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.200]   we have learned from string theory,
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.060]   but they nevertheless have some of these ideas
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:24.500]   like topological gravity aspects
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:28.020]   are emphasized in the context of loop quantum gravity
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:28.860]   in some form.
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:31.260]   And so these ideas might be there in some kernel,
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:32.420]   in some corners of string theory.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.340]   In fact, I wrote a paper about topological string theory
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:38.220]   and some connections potentially loop quantum gravity,
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:39.240]   which could be part of that.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.620]   So there are little facets of connections.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.820]   I wouldn't say they're complete,
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:46.100]   but I would say most probably what will happen
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:48.460]   to some of these ideas, the good ones at least,
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:51.840]   they will be absorbed to string theory if they are correct.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.360]   - Let me ask you a crazy out there question.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:59.360]   Can physics help us understand life?
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.880]   So we spoke so confidently about the laws of physics
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.160]   being able to explain reality,
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:11.880]   and we even said words like theory of everything,
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.560]   implying that the word everything
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.800]   is actually describing everything.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:20.500]   Is it possible that the four laws we've been talking about
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:22.040]   are actually missing,
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:24.800]   they are accurate in describing what they're describing,
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:26.240]   but they're missing the description
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.500]   of a lot of other things like emergence of life
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:35.060]   and emergence of perhaps consciousness.
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:39.260]   So is there, do you ever think about this kind of stuff
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:44.260]   where we would need to understand extra physics
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.440]   to try to explain the emergence of these complex pockets
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:54.240]   of interesting, weird stuff that we call life
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.140]   and consciousness in this big homogeneous universe
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.400]   that's mostly boring and nothing is happening in?
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.600]   - So first of all, we don't claim that string theory
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.480]   is the theory of everything in the sense
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.680]   that we know enough what this theory is.
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:09.280]   We don't know enough about string theory itself.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.100]   We are learning it.
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.040]   So I wouldn't say, okay, give me whatever,
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:13.240]   I will tell you how it works.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.480]   No, however, I would say by definition,
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:19.420]   by definition to me physics is checking all reality.
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:22.560]   Any form of reality, I call it physics.
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.400]   That's my definition.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.600]   I mean, I may not know a lot of it,
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.840]   like maybe the origin of life and so on,
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.280]   maybe a piece of that,
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.920]   but I would call that as part of physics.
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.560]   To me, reality is what we're after.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.720]   I don't claim I know everything about reality.
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:37.620]   I don't claim string theory necessarily
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:41.320]   has the tools right now to describe all the reality either,
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.360]   but we are learning what it is.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.840]   So I would say that I would not put a border to say,
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.280]   no, you know, from this point onwards,
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.420]   it's not my territory, somebody else's.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.840]   But whether we need new ideas in string theory
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.120]   to describe other reality features,
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:54.800]   for sure I believe, as I mentioned,
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.080]   I don't believe any of the laws we know today is final.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.840]   So therefore, yes, we will need new ideas.
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.520]   - This is a very tricky thing for us to understand
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:08.080]   and be precise about.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:12.760]   But just because you understand the physics
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:17.000]   doesn't necessarily mean that you understand
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.800]   the emergence of chemistry, biology,
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:23.800]   life, intelligence, consciousness.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:27.760]   So those are built, it's like you might understand
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:30.560]   the way bricks work,
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.560]   but to understand what it means to have a happy family,
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:37.600]   you don't get from the bricks.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.280]   So directly, in theory you could,
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.760]   if you ran the universe over again,
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:47.440]   but just understanding the rules of the universe
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.880]   doesn't necessarily give you a sense
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:52.280]   of the weird, beautiful things that emerge.
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:55.400]   - Right, no, so let me describe what you just said.
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:56.240]   So there are two questions.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.520]   One is whether or not the techniques I use
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:00.620]   in let's say quantum field theory and so on
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:02.400]   will describe how the society works.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.240]   - Yes.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:04.800]   - Okay, that's far distance,
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:08.280]   far different scales of questions that we're asking here.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.520]   The question is, is there a change of,
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:12.960]   is there a new law which takes over
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.280]   that cannot be connected to the older laws that we know
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:18.080]   or more fundamental laws that we know?
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.360]   Do you need new laws to describe it?
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:22.000]   I don't think that's necessarily the case
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.680]   in many of these phenomena like chemistry
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:25.240]   or so on you mentioned.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:27.680]   So we do expect, in principle chemistry
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.600]   can be described by quantum mechanics.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.640]   We don't think there's gonna be a magical thing,
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.960]   but chemistry is complicated.
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.840]   Yeah, indeed there are rules of chemistry
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.440]   that chemists have put down
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:39.460]   which has not been explained yet using quantum mechanics.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:41.080]   Do I believe that they will be something
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.160]   described by quantum mechanics?
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:43.000]   Yes, I do.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.940]   I don't think they are going to be sitting there
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:47.080]   in the sheds forever, but maybe it's too complicated
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:50.320]   and maybe we'll wait for very powerful quantum computers
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.640]   or whatnot to solve those problems.
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:52.620]   I don't know.
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:54.760]   But I don't think in that context
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.960]   we have new principles to be added to fix those.
[01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:01.780]   So I'm perfectly fine in the intermediate situation
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:04.040]   to have rules of thumb or principles
[02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.840]   that chemists have found which are working,
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:07.920]   which are not founded on the basis
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:10.420]   of quantum mechanical laws, which does the job.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:13.320]   Similarly, as biologists do not found everything
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:15.480]   in terms of chemistry, but they think,
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:16.760]   there's no reason why chemistry cannot.
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.800]   They don't think necessarily they're doing something
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.000]   amazingly not possible with chemistry.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.200]   Coming back to your question,
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:26.200]   does consciousness, for example, bring this new ingredient?
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:28.280]   If indeed it needs a new ingredient,
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:30.560]   I will call that new ingredient part of physical law.
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:31.700]   We have to understand it.
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:34.500]   To me, that, so I wouldn't put a line to say,
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.380]   okay, from this point onwards, you cannot,
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:38.460]   it's disconnected, it's totally disconnected
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:41.100]   from strength or whatever, we have to do something else.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.340]   - It's not a line.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:45.780]   What I'm referring to is, can physics of a few centuries
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.220]   from now that doesn't understand consciousness
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:51.620]   be much bigger than the physics of today,
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:53.980]   where the textbook grows?
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.940]   - It definitely will.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:55.980]   I would say, it will grow.
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:58.820]   I don't know if it grows because of consciousness
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:00.300]   being part of it or we have different view
[02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:01.240]   of consciousness.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:03.780]   I do not know where the consciousness will fit.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:07.540]   It's gonna be hard for me to guess.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.420]   I mean, I can make random guesses now,
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:11.400]   which probably most likely is wrong,
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.700]   but let me just do just for the sake of discussion.
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:17.300]   I could say, you know, brain could be
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:18.940]   their quantum computer, classical computer,
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:20.780]   their arguments against this being a quantum thing,
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.940]   so it's probably classical, and if it's classical,
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:24.620]   it could be like what we are doing in machine learning,
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:26.180]   slightly more fancy, and so on.
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:28.500]   Okay, people can go to this argument to no end
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:30.080]   and to say whether consciousness exists or not,
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.280]   or life, does it have any meaning,
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:34.740]   or is there a phase transition where you can say,
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:36.660]   does electron have a life, or not?
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:39.100]   At what level does a particle become life?
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.260]   Maybe there's no definite definition of life
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:44.060]   in that same way that, you know, we cannot say electron.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:48.660]   I like this example quite a bit.
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:51.120]   You know, we distinguish between liquid and a gas phase,
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.820]   like water is liquid or vapor is gas,
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:54.660]   and we say they're different.
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.680]   You can distinguish them.
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:57.300]   Actually, that's not true.
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:59.820]   It's not true because we know from physics
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.900]   that you can change temperatures and pressure
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:03.620]   to go from liquid to the gas
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.660]   without making any phase transition.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:08.420]   So there is no point that you can say this was a liquid
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:10.180]   and this was a gas.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:12.020]   You can continuously change the parameters
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:13.800]   to go from one to the other.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:15.820]   So at the end, it's very different looking.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.040]   Like, you know, I know that water is different from vapor,
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:21.220]   but, you know, there's no precise point this happens.
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:24.000]   I feel many of these things that we think,
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.220]   like consciousness, clearly,
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:27.180]   dead person is not conscious and the other one is,
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:29.620]   so there's a difference, like water and vapor.
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:32.820]   But there's no point you could say that this is conscious.
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.140]   There's no sharp transition.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:37.580]   So it could very well be that what we call,
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:39.780]   heuristically, in daily life,
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:43.120]   consciousness is similar, or life is similar to that.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:44.460]   I don't know if it's like that or not.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:46.740]   I'm just hypothesizing it's possible.
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:48.260]   Like, there's no--
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.100]   - There's no discrete phases of consciousness.
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.020]   - There's no discrete phase transition like that.
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:55.260]   - Yeah, yeah, but there might be, you know,
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:57.300]   concepts of temperature and pressure
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:03:00.120]   that we need to understand to describe
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:02.700]   what the heck consciousness in life is
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:04.700]   that we're totally missing.
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:05.520]   - Yes.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.380]   - I think that's not a useless question.
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:09.260]   Even those questions that,
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:11.700]   back to our original discussion of philosophy,
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:15.180]   I would say consciousness and free will, for example,
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:18.860]   are topics that are very much so
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:20.820]   in the realm of philosophy currently.
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.660]   - Yes.
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:22.940]   - But I don't think they will always be.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:23.860]   - I agree with you.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:26.180]   I agree with you, and I think I'm fine
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:28.300]   with some topics being part of a different realm
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:32.140]   than physics today, because we don't have the right tools.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.320]   Just like biology was.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.060]   I mean, before we had DNA and all that,
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:37.620]   genetics and all that gradually began to take hold.
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:40.820]   I mean, when people were beginning
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:43.700]   with various experiments with biology and chemistry
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:46.020]   and so on, gradually they came together.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:47.260]   So it wasn't like together.
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:49.300]   So yeah, I have a perfectly understanding
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:51.520]   of a situation where we don't have the tools.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:53.300]   So do these experiments that you think
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:55.140]   as defines a conscious in different form
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:57.180]   and gradually we'll build it and connect it?
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:59.620]   And yes, we might discover new principles of nature
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:01.060]   that we didn't know.
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:03.380]   I don't know, but I would say that if they are,
[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:04.660]   they will be deeply connected with the else.
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:08.260]   We have seen in physics, we don't have things in isolation.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.820]   You cannot compartmentalize, you know,
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:13.300]   this is gravity, this is electricity, this is that.
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:15.220]   We have learned they all talk to each other.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:19.060]   There's no way to make them in one corner and don't talk.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:21.300]   So the same thing with anything, anything which is real.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.380]   So consciousness is real.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:25.200]   So therefore, we have to connect it to everything else.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.140]   So to me, once you connect it, you cannot say
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:29.900]   it's not reality and once it's reality, it's physics.
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:30.740]   I call it physics.
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:32.980]   It may not be the physics I know today, for sure it's not.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:37.300]   But I would be surprised if there's disconnected realities
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:41.260]   that you cannot imagine them as part of the same soup.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:44.100]   - So I guess God doesn't have a biology
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.000]   or chemistry textbook and mostly,
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.500]   or maybe he or she reads it for fun, biology and chemistry,
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:52.100]   but when you're trying to get some work done,
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:54.500]   it'll be going to the physics textbook.
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:59.500]   Okay, what advice, let's put on your wise visionary hat.
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:03.860]   What advice do you have for young people today?
[02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:08.060]   You've dedicated your book actually to your kids,
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:09.620]   to your family.
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:11.500]   What advice would you give to them?
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:13.880]   What advice would you give to young people today
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:16.780]   thinking about their career, thinking about life,
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:19.820]   of how to live a successful life, how to live a good life?
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:24.340]   - Yes, I have three sons and in fact, to them,
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:28.260]   I have tried not to give too much advice.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:31.380]   So even though I've tried to kind of not give advice,
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:33.900]   maybe indirectly there has been some impact.
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:35.980]   My oldest one is doing biophysics, for example,
[02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:38.260]   and the second one is doing machine learning
[02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:40.580]   and the third one is doing theoretical computer science.
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:42.460]   So there are these facets of interest
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.620]   which are not too far from my area,
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:47.940]   but I have not tried to impact them in that way
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.940]   but they have followed their own interests.
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:51.820]   And I think that's the advice I would give
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:54.940]   to any young person, follow your own interests
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:57.260]   and let that take you wherever it takes you.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:01.900]   And this I did in my own case
[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:04.660]   that I was planning to study economics
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:08.100]   and electrical engineering when I started at MIT.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.620]   And I discovered that I'm more passionate
[02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:11.700]   about math and physics.
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:14.020]   And at that time, I didn't feel math and physics
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:15.860]   would make a good career.
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:18.540]   And so I was kind of hesitant to go in that direction,
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:20.420]   but I did because I kind of felt
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:22.580]   that that's what I'm driven to do.
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:24.700]   So I don't regret it.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:28.340]   I'm lucky in the sense that society supports people like me
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:29.900]   who are doing these abstract stuff,
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:32.540]   which may or may not be experimentally verified
[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:34.740]   even let alone applied to the daily technology
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:36.380]   in our lifetime.
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:37.660]   I'm lucky I'm doing that.
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:41.300]   And I feel that if people follow their interests,
[02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.940]   they will find the niche that they're good at.
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:48.020]   And this coincidence of hopefully their interests
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:51.860]   and abilities are kind of aligned,
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:54.420]   at least some extent to be able to drive them
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:56.260]   to something which is successful.
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.540]   And not to be driven by things like,
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:00.020]   this doesn't make a good career,
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:01.060]   or this doesn't do that,
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:03.740]   and my parents expect that, or what about this.
[02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:06.140]   I think ultimately you have to live with yourself
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:08.660]   and you only have one life and it's short, very short.
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.580]   I can tell you I'm getting there.
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:11.500]   So I know it's short.
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.980]   So you really want not to do things
[02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:15.900]   that you don't want to do.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.340]   So I think following your interests
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:19.300]   is my strongest advice to young people.
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:22.180]   - Yeah, it's scary when your interest
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:26.620]   doesn't directly map to a career of the past or of today.
[02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:28.700]   So you're almost anticipating future careers
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:30.460]   that could be created, it's scary.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:34.180]   But yeah, there's something to that,
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.820]   especially when the interest and the ability align,
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:39.620]   that you will pave a path,
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.220]   that we'll find a way to make money,
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:42.660]   especially in this society,
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:46.260]   in the capitalistic United States society.
[02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:51.260]   It feels like ability and passion paves the way.
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.100]   - Yes.
[02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:56.940]   - At the very least you can sell funny T-shirts.
[02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:57.780]   - Yes.
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:59.920]   - You've mentioned life is short.
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:04.140]   Do you think about your mortality?
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.900]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.080]   - I don't think about my mortality.
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:12.460]   I think that I don't think about my death,
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:14.700]   I don't think about death in general too much.
[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:16.800]   First of all, it's something that I can't do much about.
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:19.540]   And I think it's something that it doesn't,
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:21.640]   it doesn't drive my everyday action.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:24.100]   It is natural to expect that it's somewhat
[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:25.940]   like the time reversal situation.
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:27.900]   So we believe that we have this approximate symmetry
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.420]   in nature, time reversal.
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:32.320]   Going forward we die, going backwards we get born.
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:35.060]   So what was it to get born?
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:38.780]   It wasn't such a good or bad thing, I have no feeling of it.
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:42.140]   So who knows what the death will feel like,
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:43.460]   the moment of death or whatnot.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.460]   So I don't know, it is not known.
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:50.140]   But in what form do we exist before or after?
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:53.740]   Again, it's something that it's partly philosophical maybe.
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:55.900]   - I like how you draw comfort from symmetry.
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:58.700]   It does seem that there is something asymmetric here,
[02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:02.540]   breaking of symmetry because there's something
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:07.860]   to the creative force of the human spirit
[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:09.540]   that goes only one way.
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:10.380]   - Right.
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:13.140]   - That it seems the finiteness of life
[02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:15.940]   is the thing that drives the creativity.
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:20.940]   And so it does seem that at least contemplation
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:24.580]   of the finiteness of life, of mortality,
[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:27.060]   is the thing that helps you get your stuff together.
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:28.120]   - Yes, I think that's true.
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:29.580]   But actually I have a different perspective
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:30.420]   on that a little bit.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.240]   - Yes.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:34.820]   - Namely, suppose I told you you're immortal.
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:35.660]   - Yes.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.780]   - I think your life would be totally boring after that
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.640]   because you will not, there's,
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:45.940]   I think part of the reason we have enjoyment in life
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:47.280]   is the finiteness of it.
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:48.120]   - Yes.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:52.180]   - And so I think mortality might be a blessing
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.000]   and immortality may not.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.960]   So I think that we value things
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:58.080]   because we have that finite life.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:00.000]   We appreciate things, we wanna do this,
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.600]   we wanna do that, we have motivation.
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.080]   If I told you, you know, you have infinite life,
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:04.680]   oh, I don't need to do this today,
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:08.520]   I have another billion or trillion or infinite life,
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.160]   so why do I do now?
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:11.840]   There is no motivation.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:14.220]   A lot of the things that we do are driven
[02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.960]   by that finiteness, the finiteness of these resources.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.100]   So I think it's a blessing in disguise.
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:23.400]   I don't regret it that we have more finite life.
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:28.400]   And I think that the process of being part of this thing,
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.080]   that, you know, the reality,
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.400]   to me, part of what attracts me to science
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:39.700]   is to connect to that immortality kind of,
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:43.920]   namely the loss, the reality beyond us.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.880]   To me, I'm resigned to the fact that not only me,
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.800]   everybody's going to die.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.960]   So this is a little bit of a consolation.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.860]   None of us are going to be around.
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:55.240]   So therefore, okay,
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:57.360]   and none of the people before me are around.
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.620]   So therefore, yeah, okay,
[02:10:58.620 --> 02:10:59.940]   this is something everybody goes through.
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:03.880]   So taking that minuscule version of, okay,
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:07.520]   how tiny we are and how short time it is and so on,
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:10.140]   to connect to the deeper truth beyond us,
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:11.920]   the reality beyond us,
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:16.820]   is what sense of, quote unquote, immortality I would get.
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:18.760]   Namely, at least I can hang on
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:20.720]   to this little piece of truth,
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:23.200]   even though I know, I know it's not complete.
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:25.800]   I know it's going to be imperfect.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:28.440]   I know it's going to change and it's going to be improved.
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.580]   But having a little bit deeper insight
[02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:32.700]   than just the naive thing around us,
[02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:35.240]   little Earth here and little galaxy and so on,
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:40.140]   makes me feel a little bit more pleasure to live this life.
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:43.200]   So I think that's the way I view my role as a scientist.
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:46.320]   - Yeah, the scarcity of this life
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.200]   helps us appreciate the beauty of the immortal,
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.680]   the universal truths that physics present us.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.680]   So maybe one day physics will have something to say
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.400]   about that beauty in itself,
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:06.520]   explaining why the heck it's so beautiful
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:08.280]   to appreciate the laws of physics
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:13.280]   and yet why it's so tragic that we die so quickly.
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.160]   - Yes, we die so quickly.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.080]   So that can be a bit longer, that's for sure.
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:19.200]   - It would be very nice.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:20.820]   Maybe physics will help out.
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:23.880]   - Well, Kamran, it was an incredible conversation.
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:25.600]   Thank you so much once again for painting
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.360]   a beautiful picture of the history of physics.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.440]   And it kind of presents a hopeful view
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:33.520]   of the future of physics.
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:35.800]   So I really, really appreciate that.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:37.400]   It's a huge honor that you would talk to me
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.320]   and waste all your valuable time with me.
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:40.160]   I really appreciate it.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:40.980]   - Thanks, Lex.
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:42.760]   It was a pleasure and I loved talking with you
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:44.520]   and this is wonderful set of discussions.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:46.480]   I really enjoyed my time with this discussion.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:47.960]   Thank you.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.440]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:52.640]   with Kamran Vafa and thank you to Headspace,
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.660]   Jordan Harberger Show, Squarespace and Allform.
[02:12:56.660 --> 02:13:00.200]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.600]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.040]   from the great Richard Feynman.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.540]   Physics isn't the most important thing, love is.
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.320]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.900]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:17.480]   (upbeat music)
