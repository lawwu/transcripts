[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.440]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.200]   of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.880]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.780]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.600]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.240]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.480]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.560]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.680]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.560]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.520]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.680]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.660]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.440]   to this episode of Everyday Educator
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.920]   because I have a great guest with me today
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.520]   who is going to share with us
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.400]   a little bit about how homeschooling your children
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   helps you as a parent restore your own education,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.600]   but it also teaches you a lot about yourself.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.620]   And so I am excited to talk
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.080]   to my friend Cynthia Knotts today.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.880]   You are gonna be so glad that you got to know Cynthia.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.640]   She's a mom and a tutor and a musician
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   and a violin teacher and a reader and a lifelong learner.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.940]   And so she's got lots of wisdom for us.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.480]   And we're just gonna spend the next few minutes
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.880]   talking about what teaching children
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.760]   teaches us.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.440]   And I'm glad that you're here to listen along.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.880]   Cynthia, thanks so much for talking to me today.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.480]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   - I'm excited to get to know a little bit of your backstory.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.880]   What kind of student were you growing up?
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   Did you like school?
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400]   - So yeah, I did really like school,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.840]   especially in the earlier years.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600]   I'm a public school product.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.900]   I walked to the elementary school a block from my house
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.160]   and got to walk with my older brother when I was younger.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   And then I got to be the big kid
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   and accompany my younger brother.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   And my parents did a really good job setting a culture
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.980]   of learning and education in the home.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.460]   - Wow, that's cool.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.160]   - Yeah, it was great.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.740]   I tell them sometimes that they actually gave us
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.720]   a classical homeschool education and never realized it.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.920]   - Yes, didn't know what they were doing for you.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.760]   - Yeah, and we supplemented that with our public education.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.400]   So, but yeah, I did like school.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   I was usually a pretty good student on top of things,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.120]   but I definitely did notice a shift as I got to high school.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   Even though I still enjoyed learning,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.200]   I was much more focused on getting the GPA
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.800]   that I thought I had to get.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.040]   So I followed in the footsteps of my very bright
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.360]   older brother who ended up going to Harvard
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.120]   and put a lot of pressure on myself.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.280]   So it became more about keeping the GPA
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.240]   when I was in high school.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.660]   - Yeah, and I'm guessing that your parents
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.540]   didn't put that pressure on you
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600]   so much as you put it on yourself.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.120]   - Yeah, not at all, not at all.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.720]   - Well, what did you love to learn?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.760]   I want to see how similar we are.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   What did you like to stay?
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.480]   Or were you one of those well-rounded students
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.560]   who liked everything or were there things
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.960]   you liked the most?
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.700]   - I think now there's a lot more things I like
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.540]   than I did then.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.440]   - Oh, wow, that's such a good way to have become.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.200]   - Yeah, I was not always a huge fan
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.760]   of the science courses I took.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   And I was not always a huge fan
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   of the history courses I took.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.280]   But I loved anything literature and math.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.080]   I absolutely loved math.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.400]   It came easily to me.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.480]   I really liked it, at least up until the end.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.920]   And I was, of course, always involved
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.120]   in a lot of music stuff.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.960]   So I think my senior year of high school,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.280]   three of my seven courses were music-related.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.760]   I was in band orchestra and I took a music history class.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.040]   - Oh, wow, so you found your passion and your love
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.000]   and you pursued it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.280]   That's really good.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.440]   Do you remember, how did you,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.980]   'cause I was a product, I am a product also
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.240]   of public school education.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   And one of the things that I remember about my high school
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.000]   was that subjects were fairly compartmentalized.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.840]   I mean, we hardly ever talked about history
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.580]   in science class.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.820]   And I don't remember talking about anything
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.960]   but math in my math class.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.880]   So there were very much watertight bulkheads.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.480]   What about for you?
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.960]   - I would say mostly that was true.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.120]   Maybe not always completely.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   There would be some things that would come up here and there.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.320]   - Yes.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.280]   - But yeah, I mean, different teacher for every course.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.020]   And yeah, it was mostly compartmentalized,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.080]   maybe not airtight.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.880]   - Right, right.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.040]   So in your high school, did you, was it mostly lecture
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.060]   that your teachers mostly gave you notes that you took
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.680]   or did you do a lot of discussing?
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.640]   Was it a lot of reading?
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.040]   What method?
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.240]   - It really depended on the teacher.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.080]   - Yes.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.480]   - I do remember some classes
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.840]   and actually sometimes it would depend on the day.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.700]   I remember a history class I had where,
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.200]   yeah, some days we would walk in
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   and the entire chalkboard was filled with notes.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.700]   - Oh my word, I had that same teacher.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.840]   (laughing)
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.300]   - So he would talk through
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.920]   what he had already written on the board.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.840]   I don't know how long it must've taken him.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.800]   - Oh my word, yes. - But he would talk through it
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.420]   and we would copy it down and it would be a lecture.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.720]   But then another day we would come in
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.280]   and all the desks would be circled up
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.540]   and we would have a much more conversational day
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.500]   in the classroom that day.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.700]   So with that teacher, it was a mixture.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.560]   - That's cool. - With other teachers, yeah.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.660]   With other teachers, it was probably more lecture heavy
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.140]   with the occasional conversation thrown in.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.780]   And then I remember my AP English teacher
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.540]   had us do this mysterious thing
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.620]   that he called Socratic circles.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.240]   - Oh my goodness, a precursor to your classical education.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.520]   - Yes, yes, but it was great.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.840]   Senior year, AP English,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.300]   reading some really good literature
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.120]   and that class was a lot more conversation heavy.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.300]   - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.300]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.020]   So you had a little bit of lecture,
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.340]   a little bit of discussion,
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.120]   a little bit of Socratic circles.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.420]   How did you learn best?
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.600]   What was your favorite learning style
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.140]   or the most effective for you?
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.100]   - I would say probably conversation.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.600]   Lectures, I think I would get too caught up
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.040]   with trying to write all the things down.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.460]   - Yes.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.500]   - And reading, well, it would depend on what I was reading.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.220]   - Sure, sure.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.080]   - If it was a dry history text,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.140]   it might just kind of wash over me.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.860]   - Yes, passing your eyes over the words.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.940]   - I would just look for the bold print.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.900]   - Yes, chapter headings and section headings.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.860]   - Yes, let's just get through this.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.180]   - But in a conversation or if it were a teacher
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.260]   who was just very passionate
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.420]   about what they were talking about
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.500]   and getting really excited, even if it was a lecture style,
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   having that excitement would really catch my attention.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.020]   - Yes, that's so true.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.740]   I did, I had a history teacher who got very excited
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.780]   about her subject sometimes
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.460]   and to the point where you wondered
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.100]   is she gonna, she would sometimes draw students
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.380]   into her hands-on history learning
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.420]   and it could be a little intense,
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.420]   but she really did make you think
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.620]   and really did draw you into the subject.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.820]   I think I would agree with you.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.660]   I liked conversational learning the best too.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.480]   So being the product of a public school education,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.120]   what drew you and your husband, Tim, to homeschooling?
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.560]   - It was a few things.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.520]   Initially, it was seeing families in our church
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.220]   who were homeschooling.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.160]   It was probably about a half and half split
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.300]   when we were dating, engaged, newlywed.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.300]   And there were enough that were homeschooling
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.840]   that we could see what the kids were like
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.100]   and what was going on.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.220]   Tim was much more hesitant about homeschooling than I was.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.060]   - Isn't that funny?
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.060]   My husband was too.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.140]   What was Tim's hesitation?
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.760]   - Oh, homeschoolers are weird.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.920]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.300]   - So, but there were not very many when we were growing up.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.940]   I knew a few and they were mostly kids
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.020]   who were pretty serious about music
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.800]   and needed more time to practice.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.640]   - Gotcha.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.540]   - Which has its own level of weirdness.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.380]   - Right, right.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.100]   But that was a different kind of concern, maybe,
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.060]   than what would, 'cause you don't know about your kids yet
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.460]   when you're just considering them.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.420]   - Just all academic thought.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.500]   - Yeah, so we got to see it in action.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.040]   And there was one family in particular
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   that had been very, they had been mentors to us
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.460]   all through our dating and our engagement.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.760]   And Gustav actually composed my bridal march for me.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.520]   - Oh, how lovely.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.120]   - Yeah, so they were really close friends
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.680]   and I was involved in Bible study with Nancy
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.360]   and they were classically homeschooling their,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.700]   at the time, four kids or three kids and a baby.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.620]   And being in Nancy's house for Bible study
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.560]   on Friday mornings, we would start our study early, 6.30,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.860]   and the kids would get up.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.880]   Actually, I think she usually had the nursing baby
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.680]   and then the kids would come up and get up
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.620]   and come downstairs and pull out their copywork
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.460]   and their cursive and just get right to work.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.680]   And so I was seeing this happen in the house
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   and I was intrigued and she was very much a user
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.120]   of the "Well Trained Mind" book.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.480]   - Yes, yes.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.920]   - So that was really our introduction
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.760]   to classical homeschool was watching
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   this one particular family and seeing the culture
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.780]   in their home.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.780]   - That's really cool.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.500]   I can see how that lifestyle that you saw
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.200]   would be really appealing.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.540]   So did you know a lot about classical education
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.380]   beyond the lifestyle that you saw in your friends
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.080]   before you really started homeschooling yourself?
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.600]   - Not really a whole lot.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.440]   - Yeah.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.860]   - No, I mean, I knew that it had to do
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.820]   with Greeks and Romans and Latin.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.020]   And probably because once again with my parents
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.020]   setting this kind of classical education sneakily
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:12.520]   in our house growing up, we read things about ancient Rome
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.520]   and ancient Egypt and the Greek gods and all this stuff.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.040]   So I knew it had something to do with that,
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.400]   but not much more.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.500]   - Yep, so how did you find out more
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.800]   about classical education?
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.380]   - Well, my sister actually was already homeschooling
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.780]   her kids, both of my sisters homeschooled their children
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:41.460]   and in different styles and neither one a believer.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.880]   But my oldest sister who was a, she was a classics major
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.580]   in college was pursuing a classical education
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.560]   at home with her kids.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.180]   And so I was picking up a little bit from her
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.420]   and seeing what they were doing
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.460]   and she handed some resources to me.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:03.620]   And both of her kids ended up going to Boston Latin
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.260]   for high school, which is a pretty prestigious
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.360]   Boston high school.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.180]   I was like, huh, well, she must be doing something
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.280]   pretty good with them.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.480]   And then once again, through this family,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.880]   starting to learn more about what they were doing.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.380]   And then I read "The Well-Trained Mind"
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.880]   and then I went and visited a CC campus.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.300]   - Okay. - And I was hooked.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.580]   I was hooked very quickly.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:40.460]   My oldest Adele was just shy of four.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.540]   So yeah, it was a couple months before her fourth birthday.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.560]   And my friend, a couple of my friends from church
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.100]   were involved in this new thing in central Connecticut
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.300]   and invited me to go observe.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.140]   I think it was the final week of the semester of the year,
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.580]   week 24. - Oh wow, yeah.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.580]   - And so I took Adele and my toddler
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.140]   and my three month old, two month old nursing baby.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.940]   - Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.940]   - We walked in and sat there
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.080]   for the new grammar in foundations.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.460]   And one girl was, I think was preparing for memory master.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.920]   She was only five and my jaw was dropping
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.040]   listening to her recite the first 12 elements
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.100]   of the periodic table.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.140]   - Uh-huh, yep. - But what actually,
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.280]   what actually struck me there was how much
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.900]   like Suzuki violin this was. - Oh.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.860]   - And I was like, I like this, I want this.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.980]   Let me wait one more year
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.780]   because I've got lots of little kids right now.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.460]   So I waited one more year and then we started
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.840]   and I might be getting ahead in your questions here,
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.340]   but I started tutoring. - That's okay.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.580]   - I started tutoring right off the bat.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.520]   So first year in, I was tutoring
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.740]   and I was newly pregnant with number four.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.600]   - Oh my goodness. (laughing)
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   Okay, so what made you want to tutor right away
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.620]   and what gave you the shot in the arm?
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.980]   Because, you know, Cynthia, that's a lot to take on,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.360]   pregnant with all these little kids.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.460]   What made you want it that badly?
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.700]   - Well, first of all, I didn't know yet,
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.780]   I don't think I knew yet about being pregnant
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.260]   when I got asked to tutor.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.800]   So that came a very short time later.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.300]   But no, my friend was directing.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.660]   It was her first year directing
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.660]   and she needed another tutor and she already knew me.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.420]   We go to church together and I don't think
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.020]   I was teaching her daughter violin yet,
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.120]   but she knew that I taught violin.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.260]   And so she, for some reason had some confidence in me
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.660]   that I would be able to do this.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.420]   And I was really curious and I was willing to help out
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.980]   because I knew I wanted to do this.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   And I went to practicum and was very confused
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.560]   about all these new things I was hearing,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.980]   but I was excited to do it.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.960]   - And I remember the first practicum I ever went to.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.180]   And it was so long ago that it was nothing
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.480]   like practicum is now.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.700]   It was so long ago that it was me and 23 other women
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.460]   sitting in a second story, un-air-conditioned
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.020]   Sunday school room with Lee talking for six hours,
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.820]   it felt like straight, making swiggle marks
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.560]   all over the whiteboard, so excited.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.020]   And I came home and I know how you feel.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.500]   My head was spinning.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.260]   There were all these new words
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.380]   and there was all this new enthusiasm.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.980]   And I was drawing little, no lie, math diagrams
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.640]   on a cocktail napkin to my husband.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.300]   And he's like, "What has happened to you
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.100]   that you were talking to me about math?"
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.760]   So I understand practicum can make you excited
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.620]   to do big, hairy, audacious things.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.620]   And you don't realize that you're doing something
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.620]   very compelling, but maybe, like you would say,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.680]   in over your head.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.740]   But were you in over your head?
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.060]   Did you love tutoring?
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.040]   - Oh yeah, I did.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.140]   I mean, I was so nervous that first day.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.980]   - Yes, of course, 'cause it's new.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.460]   - Yeah, it was new, but I was used to that feeling
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.000]   because each year when I would start up
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.520]   my new violin group class, and sometimes it would be
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.520]   five or six little four-year-olds or something,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.500]   and I would still be nervous the first time.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.860]   So I knew I would get over that.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.040]   - Well, that is good.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.120]   So you knew that you just had to jump in and start
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.920]   in order for it to ever get better, yeah.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.680]   What did you like about tutoring in those early days?
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.640]   - Well, see, I tutored the Abecedarians
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.620]   my first year in, Adele was five,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.180]   and then my son was in the toddler room,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.680]   and I think my one-year-old by then was in the nursery.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.020]   And those little kids are just so cute.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.260]   - Yes. - Oh my goodness.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.100]   They are so cute. - And so enthusiastic.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.100]   - Yes, and so I just loved working with them.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.860]   I actually kind of loved the challenge
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.840]   for anybody who's ever tutored an Abecedarian class,
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.780]   the little four and five-year-olds.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.360]   I love the challenge of trying to introduce
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.040]   their memory work in ways that their little mouths
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.140]   can just wrap around these big words
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.460]   and remember these big words.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.600]   So sometimes it means coming up with hand motions
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.860]   that have nothing to do with what the thing actually means.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.580]   It's just what the word sounds like.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.420]   - Right, and it's something they can hold on to, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.180]   - So I love that creative challenge.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.940]   - I wanna ask you this question,
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.460]   and it's not so much because I think
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.540]   that you worried about it,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.040]   but I have talked to a lot of parents
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.780]   on my campus through the years
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.700]   who weighed should I tutor, should I not tutor,
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.500]   and I've had lots of people worry
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.380]   that the time it would take to prepare,
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.840]   the time it would take to tutor in community
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.140]   would take too much time away from teaching their own kids.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.300]   Did you ever worry that tutoring
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.040]   would take something away from your own children?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.840]   - Not, well, yes and no.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.900]   - Uh-huh.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.020]   - I think it's always been something that I've considered,
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   but at the same time, I've never known CC without tutoring.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.540]   - Yes, yes.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.220]   - Really, we just need to get people
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.160]   in the classroom right away, and then they'll never know.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.720]   (laughing)
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.460]   - Then they don't know that there's any other way.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.180]   - Yeah, no, I mean, it has been something
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.620]   that I've considered, but probably much more
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.460]   when I did step up into challenge.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.100]   - Mm, okay.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.540]   - But at the same time, I know myself,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.540]   and I know that if I am having to do my own personal prep,
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.100]   I'm going to be so much more on top
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.800]   of what my kids have to be doing.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   And so I did foundations for seven years, I think.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.100]   - Wow, yes.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.460]   - And yeah, and then I added essentials.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.040]   So then I did both foundations and essentials for two years.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.140]   And once I started tutoring essentials,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.900]   I noticed myself being much more on top
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.620]   of the material with my own kids,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.460]   not only being able to teach it better to them at home,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.440]   but being on top of what the assignments were
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.360]   or what I wanted them to accomplish at home,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.940]   what was really important and what was extra.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.220]   - Oh, that's really good.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.240]   That is really good.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.540]   I think it does give you a nice perspective
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   on what's important and what you could scale,
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.340]   what's essential and what you could scale.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.200]   And it also, I think tutoring helps you see it
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.020]   from both sides of the fence.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.020]   Like you know what it is to present the material,
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.180]   but also you're doing it at home with your own kids.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.680]   So you know what it looks like
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.940]   from mama's side of the desk too.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.040]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.460]   So let me ask you this.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.340]   And I know you just alluded to the fact
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.560]   that you have tutored foundations and essentials,
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.920]   but you're a challenge tutor now, correct?
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.760]   - Yes.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.540]   - And so how is that different?
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.040]   How is that different preparation wise?
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.500]   And when you made the switch to tutoring challenge,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.300]   did you worry again that your increased preparation time
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.500]   would rob your own family?
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.960]   - Yes, and probably more when I made the jump up
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.620]   because I'd been doing foundations for so long.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.620]   It was, I had it down to just a very quick prep
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.540]   because I was so familiar with how it all worked
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.960]   and then I could spend more time with essentials,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.860]   which was my newer thing.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.260]   But yeah, that was definitely a big concern.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.840]   But once again, I knew that it would help me
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.420]   be more on top of things.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:11.220]   So my oldest had already done challenge A and challenge B.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.940]   And then when she moved up to one,
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.580]   I graduated from foundations and essentials
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.840]   in our community and moved up to challenge one
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.340]   to be with her.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.340]   And honestly, I think I probably could have been
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.660]   a much better teacher to her at home in challenge A
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.740]   and challenge B than I was.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.580]   Of course, I think that happens with a lot of our oldest.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.280]   - It does, they're just guinea pig.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.540]   She just, have you not made the apology yet to Adele?
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.960]   - Oh, I'm so all the time.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.100]   She actually told me to stop it.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.140]   - You were my guinea pig and you just got whatever you got
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.980]   and I'm sorry.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.940]   - And she's like, stop saying that, you're fine.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.820]   You're doing fine.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.060]   - Oh, that's so good though.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.060]   But yeah, I mean, being in the challenge one class with her,
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.220]   I was much more involved and maybe not sitting down
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.300]   and doing all the work next to her,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.660]   but I was much more aware and much more involved
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.220]   in knowing what was going on and what the expectations were.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.140]   And yeah, it was good, it was really good.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.340]   - Well, and you knew what it took you to learn
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.880]   and master that material.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.240]   So you actually did know better what you were asking of her
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.920]   as a student, since you were preparing yourself.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.760]   - Yes.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.760]   - What kind of lessons have you learned from tutoring?
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.920]   - Oh, lots.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:49.360]   Well, I've learned how to be a better teacher to my kids,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.320]   knowing what's coming up.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.740]   So when my oldest moved into challenge A and B,
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.220]   and I was already getting a taste
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.080]   of what those challenge years had to offer,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.260]   and that helped me,
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.940]   that actually changed the way I approached some things
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.460]   with my essentials and my foundations students.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.160]   And then once again, once I was tutoring and directing
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.380]   and getting all the extra benefits of those
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.380]   through training and conversations with my SR
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.620]   and being mentored by people like Heather Lee Sylvia
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.900]   and Jennifer Devorex and Stephanie Wilburn,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.720]   all these people who had such more years of wisdom.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.220]   And I had access to all these things
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.420]   as a challenge director.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.780]   It helped me even better go back to my foundations
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.620]   and essential students to teach them
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.780]   in a much more directed way.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.460]   - Yeah, that's really key.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.880]   That's really insightful too.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.540]   You know how to help your students prepare
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.900]   when you know what they're preparing for.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.040]   And you know where all of these building blocks,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.560]   you know how the building blocks are being assembled
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.260]   and what they're gonna end up looking like.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.260]   And so, yeah, it does make you a more comprehensive mom
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.140]   and comprehensive teacher
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.900]   because you know what's happening.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   What has been your favorite aspect of tutoring?
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.360]   What's been the best aspect of tutoring?
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.580]   I mean, any kind of tutoring, foundations, essentials,
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.020]   challenge, you're superwoman and have done it all.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.020]   So what's the best aspect of tutoring for you?
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.900]   - Definitely not superwoman.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.540]   But that's hard to pick a best one.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.620]   - Yeah.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.540]   - I might have to go with two that are coming to mind first.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:06.540]   One is really, I mean, as I said at the beginning,
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.140]   I really did enjoy learning as a kid.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.180]   I still enjoy it now.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.540]   And so getting to learn all this stuff,
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.120]   either relearn it and be reminded of it
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.480]   or learn it for the first time
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.560]   or learn it a whole lot better than I did is really cool.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.060]   And with all the challenge reading that I'm trying to do
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.960]   to be on top of it as a director,
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.140]   I'm loving going back and being quote forced
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.540]   to read these books, but they're so good.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.620]   - Yes.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.520]   - Or dig into things that I never got
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.100]   in my education growing up.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.100]   So I love the whole redeeming my own education.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.020]   But then my other thing that came to mind immediately
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.820]   when you said that was those little Abecedarians
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.120]   in presentation time, you just cannot beat that.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.960]   They are just so delightful.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.820]   And I think I was just the most amused and entertained
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.820]   and just loving those little kids during presentation time.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.260]   Just hearing the things that they would bring in
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.980]   and they're all smiles and all excitement.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.620]   And I nearly had a big frog jump on me once
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.400]   and it was just very entertaining.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.840]   And the costumes that they come up with,
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.420]   I just love those little littles.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.700]   They're really neat.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.860]   - They are really fun.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.860]   And just like, one of the reasons we decided to homeschool
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.140]   is because I really loved seeing
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.940]   all those light bulb moments.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.020]   I liked being the one that watched my little girl's eyes
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.200]   light up when they made a connection for the first time
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.580]   or figured something out.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:55.580]   And it was so much fun to watch students really
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.300]   of any level, because I tutored Challenge B
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.000]   for almost 10 years.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And watching B students do a proof and logic
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.340]   for the first time and realize that they had connected
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.340]   all the dots and gotten it right was the biggest buzz for me
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:23.760]   and to watch them succeed, to watch them do a mock trial
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.940]   and feel really confident and come through that
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.320]   with such flying colors and watch their confidence grow
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.320]   was such a high for me as a tutor.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.560]   I think that it is a blessing for all of us
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.940]   who get to tutor.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.240]   - Yeah, there's so many, so many neat things about it.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.700]   And now that you're saying that just so many more things
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.900]   are coming to mind, but I can't say all of them.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.980]   - But say another, say another if you've thought of it.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.520]   I would love to hear it.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.500]   - So being in Challenge II this year with my oldest,
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.060]   there's these magical things that happen in Challenge II
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.140]   as they start to get their feet under them
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.140]   as young adults and thinking more deep thoughts.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.240]   And so in the past few weeks, I've been able to sit back
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.680]   and enjoy some of the conversations that they're taking over
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.800]   and talking about things like does every story
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.160]   have to have a moral?
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.040]   Well, what is a moral?
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.240]   How do we know what the moral is?
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.720]   - Uh-huh.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.840]   - Yes, I told them in Aesop's Fable and I said,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.160]   "Well, tell me what the moral is."
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.800]   And they came up with several answers.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.600]   So I gave them this snarky response that,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.520]   "Well, really what we learned from this is that
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.680]   "you should look for the suckers in the world
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.260]   "and take advantage of them by flattering them."
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.900]   And they all immediately said, "No, that's not right."
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.700]   (laughing)
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.020]   Which that helped us.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.260]   - Yeah.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.560]   - It helped us to better define what a moral is
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.520]   and that it has to be leading us towards virtue.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.060]   So it was really neat to see them grapple with that.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.140]   And a week or two before that,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.100]   they were talking about salvation
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.700]   and God's sovereignty in that.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.400]   And it was just really neat to see these big things
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.820]   coming from them.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.800]   - That is so encouraging.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.480]   I would say, listeners to all of you out there
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.520]   who are thinking, "Well, gosh, this sounds good.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.400]   "Maybe I should tutor."
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   I would tell you that you will learn so much.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.960]   Well, in two ways.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.960]   You will learn so much from the preparation that you do
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   so that you are prepared to lead great conversations
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.600]   on community day.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   But you will learn so much from your students
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.820]   who will, no matter how well you prepare,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.820]   who will come up with something you never thought of before
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.080]   or ask a question that you didn't plan the answer to,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.260]   and they will get to watch you grapple on the spot.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.140]   Okay, so maybe that doesn't sound like a good reason
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.920]   to tutor, but I'll tell you that it feels good
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   to wrestle with a big question alongside your students
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.180]   that you have built a relationship with.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.600]   And the best thing that you will ever teach them
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.840]   is that you are continuing to do the hard work
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.320]   of learning new things too.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.920]   - Yes, definitely, definitely.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   See, modeling for them, the struggle it is,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.960]   the struggle it is to learn something new
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.880]   or to figure out what you think about something
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.240]   that you haven't had time to think about before seminar
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   is so good for them because they need to know
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.160]   that we don't have all the answers and we're still working.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.400]   We're still trying. - Yes, and that it's okay
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.820]   that we don't, I never, and it was difficult for me
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.820]   because I'm one of these type A people that like everything,
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.360]   like I don't like to do something I don't already know
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.760]   will be successful 'cause it just bothers me.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.240]   And so I had to get over myself
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.880]   when I became a challenge tutor
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.640]   because they are gonna ask me a question
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.760]   that I don't know the answer to
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.400]   or that I don't know the answer to yet.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.560]   And so I love the whole idea that we are teaching them
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   that your whole life is about continuing to learn.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   And the best learner is somebody who is comfortable
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.100]   with not knowing yet.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:05.340]   And so I think that what teaching children taught me
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.820]   is that there's always more to learn
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.820]   and that we can learn a lot from one another
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.860]   if we'll just have a conversation.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.020]   - I love it.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.940]   Let me ask you, I have one more question for you.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.100]   If you can stand one more question for me, Cynthia.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:32.020]   What has a classical education given your family?
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:37.680]   - There can be a lot there in that answer.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:42.220]   I think I'll have to pick and choose here.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.880]   I would say it's given us a direction
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.240]   in our family culture.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:55.800]   We've always valued certain things in our family
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   and both Tim and I grew up with parents who loved us
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.200]   and cared about us and cared about our education.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.680]   And so we've been fortunate to bring some of those things
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.020]   into our family.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.880]   So we've always had way too many books for our bookshelves.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.720]   - Yes, us too, yep.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.040]   - Conversations around the dinner table
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.880]   and things like that.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.120]   But I think the classical education kind of helps tie
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   some of that together and it helps flavor the culture
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.900]   that we have in our home, in the Knotts household.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.640]   I'm also so thankful that I'm married to somebody
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   who is totally in and I mean, even more than supportive,
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.020]   he takes on the reins, he does so much.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.020]   I mean, he's very involved and I know not everybody
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.280]   has quite that level of support in their homes
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.680]   and I'm really thankful for it
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:03.320]   because when we gather together as a family,
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   we can talk all these nerdy things.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   - Yeah, and everybody be happy.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   - Yes, to steal my friend Heatherly's hashtag
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.480]   that she likes to use, we're nerds raising nerds.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.920]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.360]   - We're creating our nerd culture.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   - Yes, yes, I have frequently been sad
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.520]   that our family does not live close to your family
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.480]   'cause then we could be nerds together.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.920]   - Well, come on up for a visit.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.720]   - That's right, you come on down, I'll come on up.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.000]   We'll have high old time.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.640]   Well, I really appreciate you sharing.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   I really wanted folks to hear what a homeschool mom
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.520]   who's fully invested in tutoring thinks
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.360]   about this classical education and thinks
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.880]   about being a tutor, but I was really interested
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   in people hearing what you have learned about yourself
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:09.220]   and your children and education by being a tutor.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.240]   So I appreciate you sharing tonight, Cynthia.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.160]   - Can I give another encouragement
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.120]   to anybody who is considering?
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.880]   You don't have to know all the things, you don't.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.920]   And I'm not just talking about the surprise questions
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.380]   that the kids might bring up that we talked about earlier,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.200]   but really another thing that you can learn how to do
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   is you learn your limits and you learn your capabilities
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.440]   and you can learn what is the important stuff
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.520]   that I do need to arm myself with to go in
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.320]   to have a successful day in seminar.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.960]   And you really don't have to think
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.320]   that you have to know all the things
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.040]   'cause trust me, you don't.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.680]   You've got time to continue learning
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.500]   alongside your children.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.300]   You don't have to learn everything before them.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.280]   You can learn alongside them and secret,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.960]   you can even learn behind them.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.540]   And it's okay because it's the attitude
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.700]   of being that lifelong learner.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.840]   So don't let the academic load scare you off
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.440]   because you're gonna be armed with great tools
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   like definition, comparison, those five common topics.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.960]   And it's doable.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.420]   It's a good thing, it's hard work, but it's very good work.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.140]   - Oh, that's a great encouragement.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.740]   Thank you for sharing that.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.440]   Parents, I hope that you feel encouraged.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.440]   I hope that you are perhaps newly interested
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.480]   in pursuing life as a tutor in your local community.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.020]   Whether you are looking to be a tutor
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.520]   or just looking to build a family culture of learning
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   and ways to have more enjoyable conversations
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.200]   in your own home, I've got a reminder to you
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.840]   that we have something called the Copper Lodge Library,
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.120]   Classical Conversations publishes.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.000]   And there are some new additions
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   to the Copper Lodge Library coming out this spring.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.480]   We will have our own version of Pride and Prejudice,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.840]   our own imprint of Pride and Prejudice,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.200]   the Secret Garden, and the Secret House.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.880]   The Garden and a brand new offering
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.120]   called English Epic Poetry.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.400]   So why does Classical Conversations
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.800]   offer the Copper Lodge Library?
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.840]   They are collections of stories
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.800]   that have built community throughout history.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.760]   And we put them in a beautiful series of books
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.400]   that you can enjoy for the whole family.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.120]   You can begin to build that family culture
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.680]   of reading and learning that Cynthia was talking about
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.720]   by reading these stories together
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.200]   and having really good conversations
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.040]   about wisdom and virtue.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.880]   So check out the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.880]   You can check out all of our offerings on ccbooks.com.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.920]   And those three books, Pride and Prejudice,
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.800]   the Secret Garden, and English Epic Poetry
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.780]   are new this spring.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.720]   So you'll be able to look for them soon.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.600]   Cynthia, thank you again for this lovely conversation.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.080]   And listeners, I will see you next time.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.920]   Bye bye.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.700]   (gentle music)
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.200]   (music fades)
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:50.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
