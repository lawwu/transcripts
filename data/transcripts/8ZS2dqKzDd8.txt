[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Beeping]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   [Music]
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   This week I'm joined by Corporal, Lieutenant, what was your rank Bill?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Captain.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Captain.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Yes sir.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Filling in for Duncan who is driving a German sedan on the Autobahn right now I think.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   In honor of Duncan I was looking for my goofiest hat and I think this fits the bill.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I like it.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Thanks.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Today's show is sponsored by Rocket Money.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I was playing around with Rocket Money today.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   It's a pretty cool app.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   It's really easy to link up your bank accounts and your credit cards through Plaid.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And then you go through and you see all of your different subscriptions.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Lucky me, I did not find one subscription that I doubled up on so I'm doing okay there.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   But they also have this little tab that says, "Hey, let us negotiate a lower bill for you."
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Everyone here knows that I'm good at negotiating with my cable company every year.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I'm undefeated.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   But they said, "Let us take a look at your cable bill or your phone bill with AT&T or your internet bill
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and we will try to lower the rate for you."
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And it says I have an 85% hit rate, which is pretty cool.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   But just seeing all of your different-- it shows you recurring.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   This is a monthly basis.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   This is a quarterly.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   This is an annual.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's a really cool little budgeting tool just to help understand where your money is going.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Because I think a lot of people frankly just don't know.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Maybe they don't want to know, but I think it's very helpful.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Willful ignorance.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   That's what I would plead.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So rocketmoney.com/atc to sign up.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Again, that's rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   It's really, really easy.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It's a cool little tool you can use right on your phone.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Big fan.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   All right.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Bill Sweet stepping in today.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So we have a lot of text questions.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We've got other stuff.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   We get 75 Roth questions a week.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So people really like the Roth.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Keep them coming.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Floyd.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I dig it.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   They let me out of my cage.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah, if we get 10.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I want to say thanks to, as always, the people who are here on YouTube for the live show.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Amen.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It feels like we have the same people here every week.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You can always count on them being there.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And they were here before I even signed in.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I know they're there.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   They're talking to each other.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   They're asking us questions.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   They're making us jokes.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I want to say I appreciate all of you in the live chat as usual.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   John, let's do question number one.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Let's do it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   All right.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Samuel.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Oh, I'll take this one.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   OK.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Samuel.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Good name, right, Bill?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's perfect for a firstborn.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Tweeting to me, "Any advice on how to find a good CPA, particularly for personal or small
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   business taxes when hiring one versus doing it myself would be a good idea."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We've talked about this one a little bit on the personal side of things.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We've never done it from a small business angle.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Before we get into the question, John, do a chart on for me.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   This is from Bloomberg.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Monthly U.S. small business applications, or business applications, has just skyrocketed
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   since the pandemic.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And after falling, it continued to stay in a pretty good range, and it's way, way above
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   the pre-pandemic trend.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So I think this is one of my favorite unintended outcomes of the craziness of the pandemic
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   is just an explosion in entrepreneurship.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   But if you do have your side hustle or side business or start going out on your own, there's
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   a lot more to think about.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So I guess technically, I have a small business between my blog and books and podcasts, that
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   sort of stuff.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's true.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So when my tax stuff started getting more complex, I came to you for help.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So how much more complicated is a small business than personal when thinking through this tax
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   stuff?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   How much more important is it to have a professional there to help you?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, this is a great question, Ben, and a common one.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And Ben, to me, it's very similar to a question we've got commonly on the advice side, which
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   is, when should I hire an advisor versus run my own portfolio?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   What I would argue is, like financial advice, taxes is very niche.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It ends up being a relationship business.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And again, similar to financial advice, that the value comes in the advice about what you
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   should do, how to plan.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And that conversation, thinking intuitively and viscerally with a professional about how
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   to plan for the future, the tax preparation is the commodity, just like for us, a portfolio
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   is a commodity.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So I would start with, take a look at TaxSlayer, Tax Act, IRS free file if your AGI is less
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   than 70K.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   But the threshold for when you should start looking for a professional, in my opinion,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Ben, is when you want advice.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   When it stops being a commodity, you just don't want to get the work done, but you want
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   to talk through, should I do this, should I do that?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That, to me, is where the bar is.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And probably for taxes more than anything, we have a pretty educated audience here.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But I think a lot of it in taxes is, there's stuff in the tax code that you don't even
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   know exists.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Like, you can get this break here, or you can actually write this off, or there's probably
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   a lot of stuff out there that most people don't even realize exists because it is so
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   complicated, our tax code.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah, and it gets more complicated every year, unfortunately.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   But yes, how you treat a home office deduction, a lot of those decisions on corporate structure
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   going into a small business, that is the type of thing I would strongly recommend speaking
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   to a CPA or experienced professional.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   So, the next question coming from Sam, Samuel, was how do I find one?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So, John, can you pull up that chart that I put together?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I would say three big buckets.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The number one place, and it's the same thing with financial advice, how do you find a professional,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   a CPA?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I would look for a referral.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Talk to a friend.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   If you happen to be starting a small business, something that you have someone else who is
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   a mentor, somebody that you look up to who runs a similar operation, I would talk to
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   them.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Hey, how did you get started?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Who did you talk to?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Who's your CPA?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Those to me are totally legitimate questions, and it's a fantastic way to grow a business
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   from my point of view, which is to get good referrals because you end up replicating your
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   clients over time if you know how to ask that.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So, I'd start with asking for a referral from somebody that you trust or look up to
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   in the business.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   The second thing I would think about is specialties or niches.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   There are CPAs that focus on real estate partnerships.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   There are CPAs that focus on getting depreciation right.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   One of my favorite interactions I have each year, Ben, is with a client who happens to
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   be a dentist, and he interacts with a CPA business that all they do is dentist.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That's it.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So, I really like that specifically for tax because I think, again, the advice is what
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   you're going to be paying for, and you are going to pay more, by the way, versus tax
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   later.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So, depending on your business, yeah, CPA for dentist, CPA for lemonade stand, whatever
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   it is, find your niche.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I like that one.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yep, seek that.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And then, finally, the third bullet point was just business organization.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   If you strike out on one or two, go to a local chamber of commerce, go to a local rotary,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   because I think that one-on-one, that face-to-face, you can get an idea of people's reputation.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I think, unfortunately, tax is not something that's translated well online, outside of
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   very niche stuff and tax Twitter.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Mostly, you're going to want to find somebody local that you can sit down and talk to.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Before I used you, I relied heavily on my father, who was a former CFO in the same vein
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   as you, and his thing that keeps him busy during tax season in retirement is he goes
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and does people's taxes at goodwill.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   They actually do it for free.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Right?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And I think they use the IRS free filing software.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That's for people who have very little complexity, but there are services like that that you
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   could look for as well.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Yeah, and I give Ed Carlson a lot of props, because it's a great way for him to use his
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   skills, right, and donate what he has most right now, which is time, right, to help people
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   out.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So, I give him a lot of credit.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You raised an excellent son, Ed.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Great work.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He made me do my first tax return when I was like 15 years old with my first job.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   On the kitchen table with a pencil, did you have to erase when you made a mistake?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I mean, I probably had three boxes I had to fill out, because I had a job, and that's
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I bet they don't do that.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But when should I start that for my son?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Do you think age seven, is that appropriate, the next couple of months?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   What do we think?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah, put him to work.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I've got my first one, 1987, my very first tax return.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Maybe I'll bring it to the next show.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   You still have it?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Yeah, I do.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I do.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I worked really hard on that, Ben.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   All right.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Let's do another one.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Great.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Question two.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I work for a Magnificent Seven company.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Ben, on titles, why are we Magnificent Seven?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Where did this come from?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   We just keep moving the goalposts for the biggest companies.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It's getting crazy.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It's a new name every six months.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But Robert says, I've accumulated RSUs quarterly for the past four years, and each of those
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   carries its own cost basis.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's about 30% of Robert's investable assets, almost $300,000, which is not to brag.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I'm in my mid-30s.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I have a pretty high risk tolerance.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But what is a good rule of thumb for single stock exposure?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   What's a tax-efficient way to rebalance into index funds?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I am considering selling them as there's more to vest.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   There isn't much capital gain.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   But what do I do with my existing stocks?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Should I sell my highest cost basis first?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Do I care if it's mixed between short- and long-term gains?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   What are my options from Robert?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And Robert's going to show up several times here on this show.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That's right.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Yeah, double question.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So it always kind of boggles my mind how many 20- and 30-somethings we have running into
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   on this show who work for a tech company, who have very high salaries,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and have some really good RSUs and are doing very well for themselves, obviously.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Worked hard for it.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Yeah, and probably have high-stress, high-work jobs, and probably are highly educated.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So the first one is he obviously knows I have way too much single stock exposure.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I need to get this down.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So kudos to you for admitting that and understanding that.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Some people don't ever get there.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   We have plenty of clients who come to us in similar situations.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   For a lot of them, it could be way more than 30%.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   We've had people with 90, 95% of their wealth in, like, one stock,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and they know, like, "Listen, I made a lot of money on this.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Now I need to diversify."
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Yeah, and one of my talking points for Robert here, it's not just the stock exposure,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   but not only is 30% of your net worth tied to the company that you work for, so is your income.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   So if something happens to that company, you're in pain in a lot of different kinds of pain.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So how does this work between--because for some of these, you have to pay the taxes up front
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   to vest the stocks, and then he has to pay after.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   How does this actually work?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Yeah, so relative to other types of equity-based compensation, Ben,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   RSUs, Restricted Stock Units, are extremely simple.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Ben, the concept is each year you get paid based on a vesting number of shares,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   but instead of getting paid in cash, you're getting paid in company stock.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That's it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And what they do is they play a little bit of game and chip in that they say,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   "Look, we're going to declare that you have a $50,000 RSU grant,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   but those shares aren't going to vest for five years."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And so you see the stock price, you do the math, this is how much it's worth.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   But in reality, you can't do anything with that stock until it vests,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   and that's the most important date when we talk about RSUs.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Which has got to be such a psychological toll because, you know,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   like I'm worth this much based on the stock price, and then you see it fluctuating
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and it goes up and you feel better, and it goes down and you feel worse.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Right, that rollercoaster, living that with your income.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I guess the concept is you want people pulling in the same direction, right?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   You want a profitable enterprise, and so if people are thinking as owners,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   that's the concept.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But yeah, I would agree.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's a bit of a game because ultimately the minute that you get that stock,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   there's really no tax benefit at that moment.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's exactly as if they handed you exactly that same amount of net worth in cash,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and it gets taxed that same way too.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So step one for me, Robert, would be the minute that your next tranche vests,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   just sell it immediately.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You already have 30% of your net worth in the stock in a company that you work for too.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   There's no reason to take on additional single stock exposure.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And if there's no tax benefit like there is with ISOs, like there is with ENSOs,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   just liquidate the shares going forward.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   That's step one for me.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   So as they come in, it's like reverse dollar-cost averaging.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You're slowly selling them off as they vest.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   That's great because your cost basis is equal to your market value on the date of vest.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So that's step one.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   In terms of percentage spend, not sure how you feel about this,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   but yeah, I get really queasy when we get up to 50%,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and Robert's more than halfway there of his total net worth.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I prefer for my clients to keep the total single stock exposure to 10%.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I get kind of uncomfortable when we get north of 20.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   So, Robert, you're in the danger zone in my opinion.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And, Ben, you've written a lot about financial history.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   General Motors, Enron, SVB, Lehman, General Electric we were talking about with a client today.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   These are companies that were the largest, most stable,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   most growing companies that you could possibly imagine in their day,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and they declined net worth, some of them to zero, right?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And so many people in these individual positions that work at a company
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   probably get a little overconfident, like, "Hey, I know this business.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I understand it," and that is tough for people who are in the situation of--
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Precisely.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   --the business goes down, maybe your income falls, you lose your job,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and your retirement is gone because the stock got wiped out.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Yeah, you don't want to get into that situation.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Amen.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   So our friend and colleague, Mr. Joel Fishman from Bend, Oregon,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   likes to use a regret minimization framework.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I would sit down and do the exercise, Robert.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   What happens if that stock goes to zero?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   What moves looking backward would you wish you would have made, right?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You want to be a company man.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   You want to help invest in your stock.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   You're going to continue to get RSUs.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Do you need to have that much exposure?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And I would just rip off the highest-cost basis,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   the lowest capital gains stock that's long-term,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and do that more or less as soon as you can.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   In working for one of these magnificent seven companies,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   it's Google or Amazon or Microsoft or whoever,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   the stock price is probably up quite a bit.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So you've probably already done pretty well in these,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   so the time to diversify after you've made some money,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   it's probably pretty decent timing.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I'm not going to say these companies are going to fall off a cliff,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   but you've probably done okay in these.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   A millionaire in mid-30s, yeah.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   When you've won the game, it's time to stop playing.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And again, you're going to continue to receive RSU grants,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   so there's no reason to hold that percentage.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   He sounds like he's thinking about this thing the right way,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   which is that's a good first step.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Very good.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   All right, let's do a Roth one.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Maxed out my contributions to my Roth 401(k) IRA every year
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   for almost a decade,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   with my 401(k) match being the only traditional I have.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Always weird to me that they have a Roth 401(k),
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   but then the traditional has to be the match.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   You've explained it to me, I still don't get it.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Bill Sweet recommends Roth until the 32% tax bracket.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I do.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   This person has been paying attention.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   But how does your time horizon affect the decision?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I'm in the mid-30s now, and 35% tax bracket.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I don't plan on touching it until I run through my taxable account first,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   when I eventually retire.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Does the 30-plus years of tax-free compounding growth
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   trump the high tax rate, even if I am in a lower tax bracket later?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Again, we've got someone in their 30s here who is thinking way ahead.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   They're already thinking about retirement withdrawal strategies.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   They're in the tax bracket thoughts.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   This is a good question.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Does age or time horizon ever affect your rule of thumb on the tax rate?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Yes, I think it does.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And, Robert, good to be with you again.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   The answer, of course, is it depends.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   But for me, Ben, 35% is right around the place
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   where I would favor a traditional contribution over a Roth
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   as a general rule of thumb.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We do happen to have a lot of details about Robert,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   but we're not in a place where we can give him specific financial advice.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   But in my opinion, Ben, most folks in our practice that I observe,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   they kind of slow down and they stop working, usually in their 60s.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And usually when RMDs, when Social Security kicks in,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   let's say 70, 73, sometime in that time frame,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   most taxpayers settle in around the 22, maybe 24% tax brackets.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And 35%, where Robert is now, relative to where he's probably going to be,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   that's a full 12% higher today than it is in the future, right?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And so, Robert, if you plan to delay Social Security,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   you're going to have a few years at 0%, 10%, 12%
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   to fill up those lower tax brackets.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   22% bracket in today's dollars runs all the way up to $198,000
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   for a married couple.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   P combined, the primary thing I think that a lot of taxpayers
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   don't accumulate for or think about when they're considering this
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   is that tax brackets are also adjusted for inflation, Ben.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And that's a key point, that if I can do up to $200,000
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   of Roth conversions today at 22%,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   if we have a 4% inflation rate over the next 30 years,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   that number is going to be up to 1.1 million, right?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So yes, we need to account for compounding.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I guess I didn't realize that.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So does that mean they've been tracking the actual inflation rate,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   so they've been going up pretty high in the last couple of years?
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah, so it's tied to CPI-U, just like a lot of other indices.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   There are some discussions to switch that to chain CPU,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   like Social Security did.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   But in my mind, right around 35%, that's when it stops making sense.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And even a great study I'm going to reference later
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   showed that even when you dial up the tax rates,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   like we think might happen in 2026,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   people are probably going to revert to pay about 3% more.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   That's not what moves the needle.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   What moves the needle is these big shifts from '35 to '22.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I think '35 is too high to recommend a Roth,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and so I'd stick to traditional as a general rule today.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   The last point for Robert, state taxes might move the needle,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   particularly if you're in a high-tax state now.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Yeah, if he's a Magnificent Seven company, he might be in California.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Yeah, or California, and you plan to move to Nevada, let's say.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You plan to move to Washington state, no state income tax.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Traditional makes all the more sense, right?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Because you're not going to pay that state income tax
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   in addition to higher federal tax.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   So get out of San Francisco and move to Seattle.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Yeah, assuming that anything's left there
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   that's not nailed down in San Francisco, I would agree.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Okay, all right, let's do the next one.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   So I just turned 27,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and I make $260,000 at a job that started less than a year ago.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   That's a lot of money, Ben, at 27.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It is.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It was a grind to get there, but the job itself is very stressful.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I dread going to work in the morning,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   but I deal with it for the money, and I save an investment majority,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   so I don't have to do this forever.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   For context, I have about $400,000 in investments right now.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Recently an opportunity came up that's much more interesting and pays well,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   but not as much as my current job.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   It's around $150,000.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   At this is the intersection of what I do for work and my actual interest,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   so it could be a tap dance to work situation,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   but can I stomach a $100,000 income drop
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   in the vanishing years of compounding?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Should I continue to grind it out and pack cash away
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   or let myself go down the more interesting road?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   From Gavin.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Ben, have you ever tap danced to work?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Only Warren Buffett does that, I thought.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I think so.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Buffett and Munder.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I have a lot of thoughts on this.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   You're going to have to let me cook here for a minute.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Oh, let's do it.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   This is one of my favorite questions I've gotten
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   because I think most career advice is useless
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   because I think your career path and trajectory is governed so much by luck
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   and timing and personality and politics and skills in your network
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   that it's basically impossible to say, "My career went this way,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   so if you just follow my lead, you'll do the exact same thing,"
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   because I look back at so many forks in the road for my career,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   if I would have done this, and how it changed,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and the jobs that I did get and the jobs that I didn't get.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   But this question totally hits on a trade-off that you--
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   do you want to earn a lot of money or do you want to work in the job that you love?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's a difficult decision.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   So the way I see it, especially in your 20s--
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and again, this person is very blessed to make that much money in their 20s--
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   there's three types of jobs.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   So there's learning jobs.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Some jobs are just more about learning than earning,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   like learning what industries or jobs you want to work in,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   the people you do or don't want to work with,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   the types of companies you want to work with,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and some people just need experience and on-the-job training.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Then I think there's earning jobs.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   A lot of my friends going out of college,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   the sole reason they picked a specific company was because of the salary.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   They took the best offer they could get, the best signing bonus, whatever.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You might have to put in more hours and more stress,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   and a lot of these people did,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   but setting a baseline early in your career for future negotiations
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   with different companies I think is something to think about.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You earn a lot of money at first and you set that baseline high,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   but in the future when you're negotiating salary,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   you already have that high starting.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Then I think the third one is the dream job,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   which is perfect industry, perfect company,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   people you want to work with.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I think 99% of people in their 20s probably never get the dream job right away.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   If you do, you're lucky.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Obviously, the ideal scenario is I want a job that I'm going to learn a lot,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I'm going to earn a lot, and I'm going to be my dream job.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   My 20s were the learning route.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   I worked for a company that didn't pay much right out of school,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   mostly out of necessity because I had no idea what the hell I wanted to do,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   and that was part of it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I was learning on the job, but I think that job springboarded my career
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   because I learned so much about the investment business from my boss
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   that I still use today, stuff about investment policy and asset allocation
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   and making good decisions.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So I think it was totally worth it for me.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I had a friend who went into investment banking who worked 80, 90 hours a week.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   His first year he had three days off all year, but he kind of loved it,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   and he used that to go into a different--
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   So I mean a lot of that is about your personality.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   So I can totally sympathize with the reluctance to give up a big salary
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   because you're always going to be anchoring to that level,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   and the psychological toll of losses sting twice as bad as gains feel good.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   If you get rid of that salary--
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I could say right now you could pay me five times as much,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and I wouldn't leave because I love working with you
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and working with all the stuff I get to do at Ritholtz
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   and the creative projects.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   The feeling is mutual then.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   So I love that job, and you couldn't pay me enough to work somewhere else
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   because you just wouldn't have the freedom and work with the same people,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   but I think it's easier for me to say I wouldn't take this mythical higher number
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   versus saying I have a higher number, now I'm going to go lower to take that.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So you've heard of this Harvard study before.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I think it was performed in the '90s.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   They asked a bunch of students and faculty,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   "Would you rather have a yearly income of $50,000
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but everyone else makes $25,000 on average,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   or would you rather have $100,000
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   and everyone else earns $200,000 on average,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   keeping prices and cost of living constant?"
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And it was interesting.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   The results were right down the middle.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It was half people said, "I would rather make more relatively and less absolutely,"
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   and half people said, "I would rather make more absolutely and less relatively."
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And it's totally a psychological how-you-think-about-things kind of--
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So I think life is full of tradeoffs.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I'm a huge principles guy, personally.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I would have a hard time working in a soul-sucking job that's high-stress.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I just don't have that type-A personality of I'm going to do this job,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   it stinks, but I'm making a lot of money and I'm packing it away.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So I think it's hard to put a dollar figure on the tap-dance-to-work situation.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Here's the questions I would ask yourself.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Because there really is-- There's no right answer here, right?
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I think you have to ask yourself--
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Like you said, half of that Harvard study would do this and the other half wouldn't.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Yeah, so I think it's personality.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Do you really think your long-term financial situation
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   is going to be markedly worse by taking this job?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   We're dealing with a 27-year-old that saved $400,000.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Yeah, they're already in a pretty darn good place.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   If you compound that over 30 years, you're already in a very good spot.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   How much do you really hate your current role?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I think how much better would other areas of your life be
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   if you didn't have this stress?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And what other perks might you get from this job?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Like remote work, ability to benefit,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   some of these other things you can't quantify in a salary number.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And then I think you have to think through
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   is this opportunity ever going to come knocking again?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Could you put it off for two or three years
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   and if you wanted to pack away 70% of your income for a couple years
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   to really make yourself good?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Or the inverse.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Could you go back to this hellish investment job?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   If you had to, right.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   The question really boils down to how much is your happiness on the job worth?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Which, again, you cannot answer, but I think this is--
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I would have a very difficult time answering this
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   if I was put in this scenario.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I'd like to say I'd go with my dream job, tap dance to work situation,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   but it would be hard to let go of that salary.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   A story that this makes me think of,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   my favorite author, Ben, is Kurt Vonnegut,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   and there's a great story with him and Joseph Heller,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   the author of Catch-22,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and they're walking at a beach party in the Hamptons,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   and there's some hedge fund guy,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and he's got all the cars on the beach,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   and he's got the models, and there's the shrimp and the cocktails,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   all this stuff in the '60s.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And Heller looks at Vonnegut and says,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   "I've got one thing this guy doesn't have."
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And Vonnegut says, "What's that?"
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And Heller says, "Enough."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Big Slaughterhouse-Five guy here.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Oh, great, great.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Classic story.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So, Gavin, I'd go.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I'd go, man.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   That would be my answer.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Here's one of the things.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I talk to a lot of friends and family members
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   who just hate their bosses
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   or hate the people they work with or hate their job.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   With people outside of the industry,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I rarely talk about my job because I actually enjoy it.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I like what I do.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I like the people I work with.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   We have fun together.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   My wife is always saying, like,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   "Stop talking about your job to other people
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and saying that you like it,"
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   because they don't, obviously.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   So I don't know how you can put a price on
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   having a job that you love going to
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   just because of how much time you spend working in your life.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   True, true.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And especially if you can find that dream job in your 20s,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I do agree that I don't know how often that comes around
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   where you have that opportunity.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Yep.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Gavin, money's not all that's in life.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Trade some money for time.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   True.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   All right.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Last question.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   All right.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   65, recently retired.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   When my employer started offering a Roth 401(k),
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I switched my contributions to the Roth.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   See, everyone's listening to Bill.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   But most of my career retirement savings
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   went into traditional 401(k) before.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   As I look at what I will be getting in retirement,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I'm realizing that I'll be in the 24% bracket forever.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   That's pretty close to your estimate earlier.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Delayed Social Security, RMDs from the TSP,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and a nice federal pension.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   They all add up.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I'm keeping Federal Employee Health Benefit
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   instead of Medicare,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   so I don't need to worry about higher Medicare bills
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   because of IRMAA.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   What's that?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Yep, IRMA.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   IRMA.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It's a Medicare adjustment for higher income folks.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   You pay more for Medicare in your 60s.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Getting assets into the Roth will protect them
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   from possible future tax increases.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Some of my account will go to my heirs,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   so the Roth might be a better wrapper for that asset for them.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Given all that, should I just move my money
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   out of the traditional account into the Roth now?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   For example, do the minimum Roth conversion
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   that keeps my income within the 24% bracket each year?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   My total is all in the Roth.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   What am I missing?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   So they're essentially wanting to transfer
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   as many of those traditional assets to Roth now,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   so they'd be paying the taxes, obviously.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Right.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Is it still called the backdoor Roth
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   if you do it this way?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   No, that's a conversion.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Okay, just a Roth conversion.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Yeah, that's a front door or ceiling or roof.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   So this is a little bit of the opposite
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   of the other one about the time horizon.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Well, I guess it is because they're looking for their heirs,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   but is this overkill?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Is this too much, or do you think this makes sense?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   No, I think David's got all the checkboxes, right?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   So like he said, Ben, he mentioned an IRMA.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   He mentioned delaying Social Security.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   He's got a pension coming.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   He's got a TSP, a Thrift Savings Plan,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   which we've talked about on this show.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   It's a 401(k) for government workers.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   My man, David, did everything right,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and now he's thinking,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   "Gee, I'm probably going to pass these assets on to my kids,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   to the next generation.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   What is the most efficient way to do it?"
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And I think it comes down to, Ben,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   do you want to maximize your net worth now,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   or do you want to maximize your after-tax spending
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   or your kids' or grandchildren's after-tax spending?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Ed McWorry, Ben, at Santa Clara University,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   wrote the best paper on this in 2021.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   It's called
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   "When and For Whom Roth Conversions Are Most Beneficial,"
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and the quote that I want to share with the listeners,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "A Roth conversion will always pay off
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   if the time span is long enough."
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   The problem is, on a long enough timeline,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   according to Tyler Durden, we're all dead, right?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   But David's thinking beyond his life,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   and I think that's really cool.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   The curveball, I think, that Congress threw us,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   the Value Secure Act in 2020,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   is now your time span for inherited IRAs, including Roths,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   is 10 years after your death.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   But to me, that's still long enough for somebody who's 65,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   probably has another 25, 30-year life expectancy,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   tack on another 10 years after that.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   We're talking about 40 years.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   John, can we pull up my final chart here of the day?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   This is from the Ed McCrory paper from Santa Clara.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It just measures very quickly Roth conversion or surplus,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and for folks listening to my podcast,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I've adjusted the ages to 65.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   The break-even point for most taxpayers at a 22% bracket
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   is somewhere between age 80 and 84,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   depending on the situation.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Can we take the chart off for a sec, John?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   So you still have some time, then?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I think we have some time.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And keep in mind, again,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   that you've got 10 years after your mortality, right?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   So if we've got a life expectancy in late 80s,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   if David's already hit 65,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   his life expectancy is probably in the 90s.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   We're really looking at a 35-year horizon here.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   So how much will those heirs appreciate?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   So let's say he does it just--
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I'm going to do it just for the money I'm leaving to my heirs.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   If he just does those Roth conversions for them,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   how much will they appreciate getting a Roth
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   as opposed to traditional money?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I mean, it solves all the tax problems, right?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Because if you end up getting a Roth on the back end,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   tax-free, you're not writing a check to the IRS.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   You're not doing any tax withholdings.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   You don't have to mess around with your own IRMA,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   assuming you're somebody 65.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I think it's the thing to do
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   if you're looking at a 35- or 40-year time horizon.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   David, I give you all the credit to doing it.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   The key point I wanted to emphasize, though, Ben,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   is I wouldn't go beyond--I said this before--
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I wouldn't go up to the 32% tax bracket.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I would draw a line at 24,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   because after that, it stops making sense.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   I don't know what the dollar amount is we're looking at,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   but assuming that we have income from our TSP,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   from our Social Security, from our government pension,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   we just don't want to go too far, right?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   We don't want to be paying at 37%.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So I think it's a multi-year process,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   but David's got the right idea,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and I don't mind getting started here today.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Kudos to the audience today.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   These are all great questions.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I think this also--but I think this also proves--
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   all these questions prove--
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   you can study all this stuff you want and know everything,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and it's still hard to make decisions at some point, right?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Because I've done this right, I've done this right,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I've done this right, I know this,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I understand what this means,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   but still, now, what do I do?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And I think that's always the challenge
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   with financial decisions is,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   even if you do everything right,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   it's still difficult psychologically to realize, like,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   "What if I go left and what if I go right?"
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Because it's rarely black and white for these things.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Yep, and it goes back to the first listener's question
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   from Robert, which I believe--or Samuel,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   "When do I look for a CPA?"
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   When you want to sit down and talk about advice.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And I would not be afraid to ask a professional,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   "What should I do?"
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   At the end of the conversation,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   going back to Joey Fishman, regret minimization,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   what am I going to regret more, looking back?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Am I going to regret more not doing enough Roth
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   or paying the tax?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And that probably would give you the answer.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Perfect.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Okay.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   We only have a million more tax questions in the doc,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   so they'll be back again, of course.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Keep them coming.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Thank you for filling in for Duncan.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I'm very excited for Duncan to come back.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   There's a part of my heart that's missing right now.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Yes, we all miss him.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Come back from Germany.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Thank you to John for handling everything behind the scenes,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   as usual, all the charts.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   God bless you, John, Nicole, big shouts.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Remember, our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
