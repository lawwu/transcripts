[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Well, does holy anger kill our delight in God?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.880]   It's a good question from Matt, a listener in Wisconsin.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.360]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.120]   I think we're living in an age where Christians
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.400]   are taking hard stances on just about anything
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800]   and everything, making decisions about vaccines
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.960]   and politicians and masks,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.520]   decisions all held with unflexing biblical conviction.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.220]   And then those staunch positions
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.360]   and the resulting strong language is justified
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.820]   by Christians in terms of righteous anger,
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.220]   like Jesus flipping tables and not sinning.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.200]   A long time back in an episode on abortion, APJ 672,
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.440]   you made a case for using righteous anger
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.560]   to call out the evil of killing the unborn.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.280]   It witnesses to the world the degree of such
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.960]   an injustice as abortion.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   But later you were asked about the distinction
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   between unholy anger and holy anger.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.080]   That was in APJ 1100.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.520]   And there you said, quote, "I was much more optimistic
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.880]   "about a righteous place for anger when I was 30
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.160]   "than I am now.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.320]   "I have seen the destructive power of anger
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.740]   "in relationships, especially marriage,
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.780]   "to such a degree that over the last 40 to 50 years,
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.720]   "I am far less sanguine about so-called righteous anger
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.140]   "than I once was.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.300]   "Anger is not just a relationship destroyer,
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.400]   "it is a self-destroyer.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.640]   "It eats up all other wholesome emotions."
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.480]   End quote.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.200]   I'm wondering if that last phrase is connected
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.240]   to your overwhelming emphasis in your ministry
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.660]   on delighting in God and desiring God.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.480]   Were you there suggesting that righteous anger
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.940]   tends to eat up the proper, more dominantly necessary
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.520]   emotions of delight and satisfaction in God?
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.560]   And where are you now in life with the value
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.220]   or dangers of righteous anger?
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.960]   - I'm glad to address this again.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.040]   I feel very strongly about it.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   So was I suggesting that righteous anger
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.720]   can become a destructive anger that eats up
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   the God-glorifying emotions of joy and peace
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.240]   and delight in God?
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.300]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.160]   I was suggesting that, and believe it.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   Anger of a certain kind and a certain duration
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.860]   will not only eat up all God-glorifying emotions,
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.100]   but it will eat up virtually all emotions
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.020]   and leave a person with an outward,
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.020]   plastic, superficial personality or persona
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.320]   and an inward, easily offended cauldron of suppressed anger.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.620]   I have seen it in life.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.820]   I see evidences of it in the Bible.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.820]   So let's look at a few passages for why I see things
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.520]   this way and feel as strongly as I do
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.660]   and perhaps can give some help not to go there.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.820]   You have this famous statement in James 1, 19.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.260]   Let every person be quick to hear,
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.220]   slow to speak, slow to anger,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.740]   for the anger of man does not produce
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.060]   the righteousness of God.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.860]   Now, notice the logic, the logical connection.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860]   Be slow to anger because the anger of man
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.940]   does not produce the righteousness of God.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.940]   So a quick-tempered person is generally experiencing
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.380]   anger that is not of God.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.780]   And guess the logic.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.500]   It is simply man's anger.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.620]   Quick anger is regularly man's anger, not God's anger.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.900]   It's not righteous.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.420]   It's destructive.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.080]   Now listen to these Proverbs to see
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.380]   where James has rooted all this.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.220]   I think James is the closest thing we get
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.260]   to the book of Proverbs in the New Testament,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.540]   but I don't doubt that he was deeply schooled
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.740]   on the Proverbs.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.580]   So Proverbs 14, 17, a man of quick temper acts foolishly.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.180]   Proverbs 14, 29, whoever is slow to anger
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.540]   has great understanding, but he who is hasty in temper
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.700]   exalts folly.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.700]   Proverbs 15, 18, a hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.420]   but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.400]   Proverbs 16, 32, whoever is slow to anger
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.940]   is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.040]   than he who takes a city.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   Proverbs 19, 11, good sense makes one slow to anger
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.600]   and eases his glory to overlook an offense.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.120]   So then you go over to James 3, really important,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.880]   I think, to align James 1, 19, and 20
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.620]   with James 3, 14 to 18, and you see
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.620]   the heavenly alternative to the merely human anger
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.700]   that does not produce the righteousness of God.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.060]   Here's what it says.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.980]   The wisdom from above, it's heavenly now,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.020]   it's not just a man, the wisdom from above
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.920]   is peaceable, gentle, open to reason,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.920]   full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere,
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.780]   and a harvest of righteousness.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.740]   Remember, those verses back there said,
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.060]   anger doesn't produce the righteousness of God.
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.420]   So here you get a harvest of righteousness,
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.200]   and it is sown, this harvest is sown in peace
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.700]   by those who make peace.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.580]   In other words, the opposite of anger.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.300]   Anger seldom accomplishes the good ends
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.300]   that James is after, namely a harvest of right,
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.420]   good, wholesome, just, loving behavior.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.000]   It may, you know, I'm gonna get to the fact
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.300]   that there is such a thing as righteous anger,
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.020]   but it is really rare, I think,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.380]   and therefore, James says, be slow to go there,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.460]   very, very slow to get there.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.780]   So the very least we can say from James is,
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.340]   if anger should come, it should come slowly.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.020]   Not necessarily temporally slowly,
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.820]   though that's probably the case ordinarily,
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.420]   but rather in the sense of it's got to go through
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.460]   some real serious filters in your soul.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.220]   It's gotta go through the filter of humility,
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.580]   and through the filter of patience,
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.780]   and through the filter of wisdom,
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.780]   and through the filter of love,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.740]   and through the filter of self-control.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.380]   And if it comes out on the other side,
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.220]   it might be righteous anger.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.380]   Slow in the sense that put it through the paces, man.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.620]   Don't just go there.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.220]   Now, here comes Ephesians 4.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.340]   This is the only other serious,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.380]   I mean, text we'll look at in a significant way.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.300]   Ephesians 4, 26.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.540]   Be angry and do not sin.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.800]   Do not let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.420]   Do not give place to the devil.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.200]   So James says, be slow to get angry,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.080]   and Paul says, be quick to stop being angry.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   That's really significant, isn't it?
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.000]   Puts a high premium on the duration of anger.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.360]   Don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.420]   Be done with it by sundown.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.420]   It's dangerous, and the danger is the devil.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.020]   So James and Paul treat anger as a hot potato.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.960]   Be slow to catch it, and if you gotta catch it,
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.120]   toss it quick to somebody else,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.520]   or better toss it in the river.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.720]   Now, why?
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.960]   And Paul gives the reason why it's so dangerous.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   He says, don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.240]   Get rid of it quick.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.520]   Don't give place to the devil.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   So to go to bed seething, go to bed with a grudge,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.340]   go to bed with undealt with anger,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.200]   not forgiving people, holding a grudge,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.560]   is an invitation as you go to sleep
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.260]   to the devil to come on in, come on in.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.100]   And it seems that the devil specializes
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.100]   in moving in to this deadly work, his deadly work,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.260]   where anger is held onto day and night.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.260]   So one of the signs of righteous anger
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.140]   is that it comes slowly and it leaves quickly.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.040]   It does not dominate.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.340]   It does its work in the moment,
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.860]   and it doesn't stay around to contaminate.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.740]   It doesn't give place to the devil.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.420]   And what I've been saying for years
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.380]   is that what the devil does when you give him place
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.460]   by holding onto anger longer than you should,
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.740]   what the devil does is eat up
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.540]   every alternative good God-glorifying emotion.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.900]   And I would add, from what I've seen in recent days,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.900]   that he not only eats up good affections and emotions,
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.420]   but that in the absence of those affections,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.820]   he eats truth.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.140]   That is, he distorts true perceptions.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.820]   We don't see things as clearly when anger eats us up.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.740]   I have seen it.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.500]   I've seen people move from the most mild assessments
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.940]   of someone's error to damnation.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.780]   (laughs)
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.180]   I mean, just, you wonder, where did that come from?
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.820]   That they would move to the point
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.180]   of actually damning another person
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.380]   for what started out to be a relatively minor fault.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.380]   And I think part of the answer is anger eats up love.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.960]   Anger eats up affections.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.660]   Anger eats up thankfulness.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.740]   And anger eats up true perceptions of reality.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.660]   So the point is that the devil hates joy in God.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.300]   The devil hates tenderhearted compassion.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.980]   The devil hates us to be kind to suffering people.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.820]   The devil hates sweet affection for our families.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.740]   He hates it when husbands and wives are tenderhearted
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.700]   and kind and forgiving to each other.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.660]   The devil hates wonder and admiration
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.220]   at the beauties of nature.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.260]   The devil hates all the fruit of the Holy Spirit,
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.740]   love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, meekness,
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.220]   faithfulness, self-control, he hates them all.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.780]   And when we give him place in our hearts at night,
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.780]   going to bed with anger, the jaws called anger
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:10.460]   consume over time all those precious affections.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.980]   So the present state of my mind,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.780]   he asked, "Where's your mind presently on this issue?"
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.900]   The present state of my mind,
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.900]   both biblically and culturally on this question about anger
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.700]   is that anger is a dangerous emotion,
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.020]   not necessarily sinful.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.460]   God, by the way, is the only person who's holy enough
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.900]   to manage it really well.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.940]   And he does get angry and he never sins by it.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.820]   We, however, being fallen and sinful,
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.860]   must consider it much more dangerous for us
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.700]   than it is for God.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.660]   It's not dangerous for God.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.420]   Nothing's dangerous for God.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.820]   It has a proper place, therefore,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.140]   only when it comes slowly, leaves quickly,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.660]   and in between is truly governed by a love for people
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.500]   and the glory of God.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.660]   So let me end the way Paul does,
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.180]   following up on his admonition not to go to bed angry.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.540]   He says in the next verses,
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.740]   this is chapter 4, verses 30 to 32 of Ephesians,
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.220]   "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.420]   by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.660]   Let all bitterness and wrath and anger."
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.660]   So now we're told, not only do you give place to the devil,
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.940]   but you grieve the Spirit if you hold on to anger.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.860]   "So let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.980]   and slander be put away from you, along with all malice."
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.860]   And here comes the alternative.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.020]   "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.020]   forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.580]   And there's the key, isn't it?
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.580]   "Let our affections be joyfully overwhelmed,
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.300]   that while we deserved wrath and anger from God,
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.780]   yet amazingly, we have been forgiven
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.780]   by the death of the only innocent person who ever lived."
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.660]   That state of mind and heart,
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.880]   that forgiven, amazed at our forgiveness,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.140]   like John Newton, amazing grace,
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.820]   that state of mind and heart will keep anger
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.900]   from rising too quickly or staying too long.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.820]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.100]   And thank you for the wonderful follow-up question, Matt.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.340]   If you have a follow-up question,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.980]   send it to us through our online home
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.820]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.820]   Wednesday, we're back to look at that incredible episode
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.500]   in 1 Kings 18 of God's defeat of Baal's prophets.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.440]   And we're gonna look at the whole point of that story,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.060]   which is made clear in the text
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.060]   about a God who turns hearts to himself.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.900]   It's a great observation from the text made by Pastor John.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.220]   Up next time, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.180]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.020]   See you then.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:22.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
