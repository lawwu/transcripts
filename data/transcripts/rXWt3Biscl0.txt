[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   [Music]
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.800]   Pastor John, as you know there's an ongoing debate about the historicity of
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.880]   Adam. Did Adam really exist or not? And of course if Adam existed and if he was
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.280]   created from the dust, that creates all sorts of tensions in this world. Before
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.840]   we get into the theological implications for pastors and for missionaries, explain
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.160]   more about why there's so much debate over the historicity of Adam.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   Well first of all, it is in fact ironically what two days or three days
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.800]   before you called, I got a letter from a scholar who has been asked to write for
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.920]   a new book that's coming out on the four views of the historical Adam and he just
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.800]   wanted to get my take on the pastoral implications. So there's a just an
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.120]   off-the-front-burner example of how pressing it is. Before you called, just on
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.400]   a lark, I called up Wikipedia and typed in humanity or something like that and
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.640]   here's a sentence, "The splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.200]   placed around 4.8 million years ago during the late Miocene epoch." Okay so
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.080]   this state is a pure fact right there in the article on Wikipedia that number one,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.800]   human beings are the present, not the final, capstone on a millions or
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.080]   billions of year evolutionary process from inanimate raw matter to what we
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.880]   have as human beings today and the emergence of what we call human happened
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.000]   millions of years ago. So there's part of the origin for why it's a
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.800]   debate. When you go to the Bible, the picture you have is of an Adam and Eve
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.960]   created especially by God. I don't think from preceding forms of human or of
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.400]   animal life and created a good bit more recently than millions of years ago. You
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.080]   might stretch the genealogical tables out you know 10,000 years if there's
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.320]   some missing links but not much further than that. So there's this contrast
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.640]   between what the Bible presents as Adam and Eve created in a special way
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.480]   directly by God more recently and then there's the world's view of God
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.520]   either not or being involved in an evolutionary process that goes over
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.960]   millions of years. Pastor John, so what would you say to the pastor of a local
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.480]   church who says, "You know I really don't care about how humanity started, I'm just
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.040]   called to preach the gospel to the people in my church right now." What would
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.840]   you say to him? Well where would I start? I think I'd probably start by asking him
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.800]   how important the Bible is in his ministry. If you tend to minister with a
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.960]   kind of canon within a canon, like you pick out a center that you love and you
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   just make that your Bible rather than the whole of the Bible, then I probably
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.400]   am going to have a hard time answering you. But if you care about the whole
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.360]   Bible as God's inspired word and believe that whatever center you believe is
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.880]   there is centered in the whole of Revelation because God thought it wise
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.520]   to give us the whole book in order to protect the center, then I think I
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:40.120]   would say you have to care about the way human beings are characterized and human
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:51.200]   beings are originating. And the Bible presents a view that if you deny the
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.880]   historical Adam, you're probably going to set your people on a trajectory of
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.240]   understanding the Bible or how to read the Bible that could undo things that
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.560]   you think are more central. So the first answer is going to be hermeneutical.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.160]   What are you doing to the Bible when you neglect or when you disregard the
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.560]   teachings of the Bible that Jesus in Luke 3 is traced back as a descendant
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.400]   all the way back to Adam, not just to Abraham? What are you going to do when
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.960]   the prophets themselves refer, like Hosea, to the covenant with Adam? What are you
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.320]   going to do when Jude refers to Enoch as the seventh from Adam? What are you going
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.800]   to do with Genesis 2 and 3 where the foundational nature of our problem in
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.160]   sin is drawn from the disobedience of our original father? And then I
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.080]   think the most important thing I'd say to him is that when you get to Romans
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:04.760]   5 verses 12 to 21, the way Paul sets up the whole problem with humanity and the
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.920]   whole resolution of the problem in Jesus is by saying that Adam disobeyed God and
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:23.200]   in him we all were counted as sinners and Jesus obeyed God perfectly and all
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.240]   who are in him are counted as righteous. So the whole structure of salvation,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.120]   particularly justification, in Paul's mind is rooted in the way humanity
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.040]   relates to a single father, Adam, and the way the new humanity relates to a single
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.600]   father, Jesus. So I think hermeneutically it is going to be damaging for his
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.480]   people and they will not learn how to read their Bibles and they will start
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.320]   undermining teachings of the Bible, and then as far as salvation goes,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.240]   justification goes, you're going to undo the Pauline structure of biblical
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.120]   theology if you do away with this historical Adam. Thank you, Pastor John,
