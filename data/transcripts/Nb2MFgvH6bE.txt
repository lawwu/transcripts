[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   As much as I love mainstream medicine and I trained in it and I'm so grateful for my education,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.600]   I still think it is a silo-based way of taking care of patients. So even if there's an
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   understanding of the network effect more at the science level or as you described in neuroscience,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.280]   there's still, you know, if you are a woman who has constipation, fatigue,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.160]   maybe an autoimmune condition, feel stressed out all the time, feel like your hormones are out of
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.400]   whack, you get sent to the gastroenterologist for the constipation, you get sent to the
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.320]   rheumatologist for your autoimmune issues, you maybe get sent to an endocrinologist if you've
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.880]   got thyroid problems, and there's very little collaboration between these groups. So even
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.560]   though there's an understanding of the network effect in real life, it's not happening.
