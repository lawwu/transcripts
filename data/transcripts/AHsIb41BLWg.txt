[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.080]   Hi, Kyle.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.520]   My name is John, and I'm a serving military member
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.400]   that will be released medically over next year.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.640]   My question to you is regarding career capital.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840]   And specifically, do you have any advice or tools
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.160]   that I could use to evaluate my career capital
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.120]   so I can transfer as much as I can when I transition
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.000]   to my civilian life?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.760]   I get this question somewhat frequently
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.360]   from people who are nearing the end of their military career
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.000]   and thinking about the transition.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.640]   And I usually have two points to make.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.520]   The first point is what you're talking about here
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160]   is the right thing to be talking about.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.640]   That is, thinking about assessing the career capital
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.280]   you have already built up in your current military position
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.440]   and being pretty accurate about that
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.760]   so you can target what jobs you go for.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.160]   I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.480]   You want to avoid, if possible, starting over
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.720]   from a career capital position after you leave the military,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.400]   saying, let me just go start with a completely unrelated job,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.840]   because you probably have built up some valuable skills.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.440]   The right way to get that information
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   is just look at who has gone before you.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.680]   People with similar positions within the military
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   who left in the last four or five years, where did they go?
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.920]   You've got to go out there and gather this intelligence
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.040]   from other people coming out of your same specialty,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.960]   from your same rank, et cetera.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.760]   So for example, let's say you're in the Navy.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.640]   Let's say you're a nuke and you're about to leave.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.040]   And you might say, OK, where do nukes go after the Navy?
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.840]   And you see there's a couple options here
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.800]   that are pretty common.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.360]   There's some government options.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.520]   There's the NRC, maybe the NSAA.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.120]   There's some places that make sense.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.520]   Then there's some industry options
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.920]   that might make sense, OK, you go
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   work for the nuclear industry, et cetera.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.840]   And maybe there's some consulting or sales options
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.800]   where they like that particular skill set.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.260]   And then you have that information.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.000]   Now you know these are positions that value what I do.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.160]   So gather that intelligence.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.280]   The second point I make is it's often frustratingly difficult
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.520]   while you're still in the military
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.280]   to try to acquire new career capital
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.320]   in a self-directed manner.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   So I get questions about this a lot
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.280]   from people who are frustrated.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.560]   They're in their last year or two of service.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   And they're like, oh, I want to build up skills now.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720]   That's going to be very valuable when I leave.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.160]   And they're stymied by the bureaucracy.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.600]   They're stymied by the lack of flexibility.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.640]   They're stymied by the fact that they
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.840]   are trying to build up cutting edge computer IT
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   skills to get this job right out of the military.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.440]   But they're still using Commodore 64s
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   for this particular Admiral scheduling system.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   And you have to put punch cards into the thing.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440]   And it's so out of date.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.760]   And it's not relevant.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.800]   That's just the reality often of very large bureaucracy.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.760]   So that's my other piece of advice I give
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.040]   is do what you do in the military very well.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   Whatever program you're in, do that program very well.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   Serve with distinction.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.320]   Build up whatever skills are available.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.280]   Match that to the extent possible
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.160]   by asking what other people have already
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640]   done who have left in similar situations.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.600]   But other than that, you have to maybe relax on thinking
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.920]   what's going to come next.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.840]   Once you leave the military and you have that next position,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.680]   now you're going to have all that autonomy
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.040]   that you didn't have before.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.440]   Now you're going to have that flexibility that you didn't
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.560]   have before to start asking the questions of, OK,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.120]   what now do I want to learn?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.400]   What's the path I want to navigate here?
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.560]   What's the skill I could start learning now?
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.760]   So you sort of relax these last couple of years.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.360]   Do your job well.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.240]   Feel out the market.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.760]   But once you're out of the military and have that job,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.640]   now it's time to put the career capital foot back down
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.040]   on that accelerator.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   Now it's time to start asking, what should I do now
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.200]   that I can do almost anything?
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
