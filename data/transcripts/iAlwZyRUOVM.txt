[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   For me, cooking is an art.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.480]   - What's your favorite ingredient to cook with?
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.320]   - There isn't one.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.600]   It's more like when there is one, it really is one.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.560]   You know, like there's peaches
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.680]   on the cover of this cookbook.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.120]   Those peaches, those were in August, Colorado peaches.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.040]   It just doesn't get any better than that.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.480]   - On that day, at that moment, that was the best.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.080]   - That was the best, but that only lasts for a week.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.240]   And then they don't taste so great.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.080]   - Yeah.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.480]   (laughing)
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.360]   - But damn, are they so good in that moment,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.360]   and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.640]   - The following is a conversation with Kimball Musk,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.080]   a long-time entrepreneur and chef
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.760]   and author of a new cookbook called "The Kitchen Cookbook,
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.920]   Cooking for Your Community."
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.480]   You should check it out.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.920]   It is, in fact, the first cookbook I've ever owned.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.320]   I've already made stuff from it, and it's delicious.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.480]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.440]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.760]   in the description.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.120]   And now, dear friends, here's Kimball Musk.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.200]   Growing up in South Africa, you said it was a violent place.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.120]   What are some formative moments
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.160]   that you remember from that time?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.480]   - South Africa was, so I grew up in apartheid South Africa,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.840]   but more specifically, the fall of apartheid.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.640]   So it was, I was a teenager in the '80s,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.480]   and our community would,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.400]   part of our social life, frankly,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.240]   was the anti-apartheid protests
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.560]   and to go be with white people, black people,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.160]   kind of mixing it all together.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.320]   The most formative experience is, frankly,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.800]   how much I appreciate a place like America
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920]   where we have value for human life.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   So there was a country where human life was not valued.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.520]   It was a weird thing to come from that
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.880]   to here where we take it so seriously.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   If someone dies in a war or something like that,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   and we just didn't take it seriously in South Africa.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.240]   People died or people were killed.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.760]   I saw someone killed in front of me.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.160]   It was getting off a train,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.080]   and it's a very violent train known for violence.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.640]   We were stupid kids.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.200]   We didn't really listen to our parents.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800]   We went on this train, and the doors opened,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.240]   and I had people trying to get off the train,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.080]   and in front of me, two black people,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.400]   one black guy just stabbed this knife
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.800]   in the side of this other black guy's head.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   You're like, "What the fuck?"
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.440]   And you just, "I gotta get off the train."
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   - How old were you at this time?
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.640]   - Probably 16 or 17, and I gotta get off the train,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.720]   and everyone is trying to get me to get off
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.880]   because they're all behind me.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.120]   So I step off, and I step into the pool of blood,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.560]   one foot, and then I just walk for about 100 paces
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.160]   while the stickiness of the blood,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.560]   just kind of from my sneakers, just on one foot,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.020]   leaves a footprint behind me, and you just walk on.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.040]   You just walk on.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   - Did the others walk on as well?
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.160]   - Everyone walked on.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.520]   - That's an interesting point you make.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   Underlying the violence is a kind of philosophy
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.320]   that human life is disposable,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.240]   that individual life is disposable.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   I mean, that underlies many ideologies.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.000]   I grew up in the Soviet Union.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.580]   The value of human life was lower there
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.400]   than in the United States.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.840]   The value of the individual in the United States
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   is really high.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.480]   There's probably an index you can put together.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.000]   - So perpurnation, that's a really interesting way
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   to put it because violence is much easier on a mass scale.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960]   Suffering, causing suffering on a mass scale
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.400]   is much easier when you don't value the human life.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.520]   - I've heard this before, which I think I agree with,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   is when someone is killed, someone is taken from our lives,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.840]   the vacuum that it creates, the social vacuum,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.560]   is extraordinarily painful, and it truly is true.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.000]   I mean, if someone in my community passes away,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.240]   it's very, very sad for me.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.780]   And when you go to a place where,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.720]   you live, grow up in a place
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.880]   where that human life is not valued,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.680]   there's something about the,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.120]   there's a little bit less of the social vacuum created
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.760]   because everyone is kind of expecting everyone
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.800]   to potentially be taken out at any moment.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.720]   But then there's also a beauty to it
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   because there's a much more of a celebratory element.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.960]   When my cousin Russ and I, again, we were stupid kids,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.400]   we shouldn't be doing this, but we'd go into the townships
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   where a lot of the violence would be happening,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.960]   and we really didn't see most of the violence there.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.160]   It was in these more protests and so forth.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.880]   But there's a joy that also comes
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.080]   from lower value of human life.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.960]   There's a real joy.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.840]   Everyone is like, "Well, I mean, it's beautiful."
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.640]   We'd have dinner with black friends,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.080]   friends with their family, and we were still pretty young.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.320]   And there was just a real joy to it.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.760]   - When you accept mortality, you can really enjoy life.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.600]   - You can really enjoy life.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.840]   I mean, I think there's actually quite a nice insight.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.240]   I've never really put it that way,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.320]   but I think that's right, actually.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   I think you just chill out a bit,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.040]   take things a little less seriously.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.680]   - 'Cause life does end for everybody.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.040]   - It does, right.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.920]   - And if you just head on, accept that fact,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.960]   you can just enjoy every single moment
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.560]   and let go of this attachment and just enjoy the moment.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.000]   - I do love that we all live longer and so forth,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.040]   but we should live longer with the goal of joy
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.920]   and the goal of happiness and peace,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.640]   not some form of misery
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.160]   that you choose to attach yourself to.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.680]   - Maximize joy.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.640]   - Maximize joy, that's right.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.040]   There's a story that Walter Isaacson writes about
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   where Elon got beat up pretty bad and you were there.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.840]   And then you also had to watch your dad
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.360]   yell at Elon for an hour, calling him worthless,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.280]   all those kinds of things.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.120]   You said it was the worst memory of your life.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.440]   What do you make of such cruelty?
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.240]   What do you remember from that time?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.340]   - I mean, it was horrible.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.200]   I think, coming back to the point of low value
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.280]   of human life, they tried to kill him.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.500]   It wasn't, it was no holding back.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.960]   So I just watched someone, it wasn't just one,
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.600]   but there was a main person and then there was a few others
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.660]   that piled in.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.160]   They just, they tried to kill him in front of me.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   We were eating sandwiches on a staircase at the school,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.000]   in an outdoor staircase.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.400]   I just had to, they were not coming after me
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.080]   and I just had to watch and I couldn't help.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.960]   It was one of the saddest, most difficult experiences.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.880]   It just was, it was just awful.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.980]   - Just like that, life can end.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.820]   - Yeah.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.480]   - It could have been you.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.480]   - Yeah, I think, so I've had a near-death experience
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.520]   where I almost died.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   I was in 2010 and I think that, and I broke my neck
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.840]   and I can go to that story in a moment,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.480]   but this was different.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   This was, this comes back to the low value
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.280]   of human life part where if someone had killed my brother,
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.760]   if that person had beat him to death,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   which he was trying to do, life would have gone on.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.460]   In a way, that's like an insane thought in an American,
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.660]   maybe in some tough neighborhoods,
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.660]   but for the most part, it's another thing.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.860]   - Yeah, the brutality of that,
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.700]   the mundaneness of that brutality.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.540]   - Yeah.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.220]   - It makes you think of all the places in the world
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.060]   that that's happening.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.880]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.060]   - And all the beautiful people that just disappear.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.180]   - I always say to people who have an opinion about America
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.900]   that this is a really bad country or whatever,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.220]   and I say, look, please go try another country
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.020]   before you say that.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.180]   Not to say that America can't get better,
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.660]   but please go try another country
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.300]   because not having that perspective,
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.500]   or having a perspective that, I don't know,
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.540]   they'll catch up on their shoulder
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.020]   about the country that they're in.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.820]   Okay, go try another country and then come back and tell me.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.860]   Pick any country.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.380]   It doesn't have to be some very violent country.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.660]   You can pick any country.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.420]   And you just realize that actually the world
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.140]   doesn't think the same way that America thinks.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.600]   And you're gonna just learn a perspective
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.660]   that I think gives you a better way to critique
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.980]   where we live in America.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.500]   - Yeah, it's humbling.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.380]   You said that your dad was a rollercoaster of affection
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.300]   and then verbal abuse.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.340]   Walter Isaacson quotes Barack Obama who said,
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.660]   "Someone once said that every man is trying
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.460]   "to live up to his father's expectations
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.420]   "or make up for his father's mistakes,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.900]   "and I suppose that may explain my particular malady."
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.340]   Is part of that ring true for you?
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.140]   - What I thought you were gonna say,
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.380]   we thought you were gonna end the sentence
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.300]   with live up to my father's expectations.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.180]   This is what most people say.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.460]   But then you said the second part,
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.280]   which is make up for his mistakes.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.680]   And I think that's actually, that one rings true for me.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.740]   He was really, he's still alive but I don't,
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.060]   I'm not connected to him, but he's very,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:08.500]   he taught me, the phrase I used to have
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.220]   was he taught me what not to do.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.860]   So I still actually learnt a lot.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.980]   What kind of human not to be.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.940]   What kind of actions not to take.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.700]   And so that kind of, closer to living up to his mistakes,
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.940]   but it's, but my father's such a train wreck
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.660]   that it's not really mistakes.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.940]   It's like intentional actions of what not to do.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.220]   Okay, don't do that.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.940]   - But there's still the trauma of that.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.740]   You know, it has an effect on the human psychology
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.180]   and can permeate through time.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.180]   So it has probably complex indirect effects on who you are.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.660]   The good and the bad.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   - There's a critique that my friends give me,
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.100]   which is when they're talking to me,
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.100]   I kind of just drift away.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.260]   That just, I'm still looking at them.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.700]   I'm still nodding.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.620]   Might even respond to their, to them in their conversation.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.980]   But I'm actually not there.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.220]   And I've realized that actually I grew up,
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.340]   'cause my father would just verbal,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.580]   abuse is one way to say it, it is abuse,
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.060]   but it's more just verbal diarrhea for hours
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.900]   and constantly saying, do you understand?
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.940]   He wants to make sure that I'm paying attention.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.460]   So I train myself to look like I'm paying attention,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.660]   but I'm not.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.060]   - To disappear to some place.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.300]   - Disappear to some place.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   - Wherever that is.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.780]   - Yeah, and I do that less and less over time, but I--
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.620]   - But that path has been paved somewhere
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.940]   in your mind at childhood,
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.820]   so it could be easy to walk down it.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.540]   You and Elon were close growing up.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.660]   You're still close.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.140]   What did you learn from each other?
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.260]   How did you complement each other?
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.380]   - Yeah, I think we are a good complement.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.740]   I'll talk for myself first.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.500]   My strength is definitely on the social side.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.620]   I love the gathering place.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.660]   And I love putting people together in person,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.580]   and I love to have vibrant debates and conversations.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.820]   I've been doing that forever,
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.220]   including throwing fun parties and stuff
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.940]   where I bring people together
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.940]   and I really kind of want people to have fun,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.180]   but be vulnerable in a, not just like silly partying,
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.340]   but actually let's all connect.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.620]   The definition for me of a good party
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.140]   is people laugh and cry.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.500]   I want to have people have an emotional connection.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.340]   I go to Burning Man every year,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.420]   and that is there's no question,
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.220]   you will cry at some point during Burning Man.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.220]   - No small talk.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.220]   - No small talk, yeah, exactly, no small talk.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.220]   You're totally right on.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.180]   Most parties, not parties, but most events you go to
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.060]   are like clubs, these sort of nightclubs.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.100]   And I never go to those, and my joke is it's,
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.940]   why would I want to go to a place
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.780]   where I pay to shout small talk in the dark?
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.060]   That's a good line.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.220]   That's what it feels like.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.300]   The only reason I enjoy those places
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.500]   is the full absurdity of exactly that.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.020]   - Right, it's totally absurd.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.260]   - What are we doing?
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.100]   What is this?
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.540]   What is this life?
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.780]   - But I have, so my compliment for my brother
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   was just bringing joy and social connection.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.180]   And he's truly, he's an engineering genius.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.380]   I've worked with him forever,
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.060]   and we do compliment each other.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.220]   - You just came out with a cookbook.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.660]   By the way, thank you for giving me my first cookbook.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.860]   I feel legit.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.500]   - I love that it's your first cookbook.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.300]   - I'm gonna keep it on the counter,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.020]   and it's gonna give me legitimacy when anyone comes over.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.940]   Hey, listen, I'm basically a chef now.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   - That's right, exactly.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.500]   - When did you first fall in love with cooking?
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.860]   - I started cooking when I was 11 years old.
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.820]   My mom is just, she's wonderful,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.540]   but she's self-admittedly a bad cook.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.780]   But at the time, it was,
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.220]   and I think anyone with kids goes through this,
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.140]   your kids just want like something,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.100]   like spaghetti bolognese, or a burger, or something.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.660]   And my mom would do brown bread, plain yogurt,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.860]   and boiled squash, the absolute most disgusting things
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.780]   that a child could imagine eating.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.900]   And so I said, "Can I cook?"
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.220]   And she said, "Yeah, if you want to cook, no problem."
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.700]   So I went to the grocery store,
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.540]   and back in those days, a butcher,
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.380]   separate to the grocery store.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.460]   And I went to the butcher, and I said, "What can I cook?"
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.260]   And he pulled out a chicken,
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.140]   and he said, "This is the easiest recipe for you.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.540]   "Just put it on a pan in an oven, a hot oven."
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.540]   'Cause back then, the ovens weren't necessarily
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.420]   like 400 degrees, or 450, or whatever.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.180]   And put it in a hot oven for one hour,
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.660]   and enjoy, that was it.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.140]   And so I went home, and actually,
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.860]   I also brought some French fries.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.700]   I'll tell you that as well.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.820]   So I was like, "I'm a kid, of course I want French fries."
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.020]   So I did roast chicken with French fries.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.040]   And the chicken came out, and it was just fantastic.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.880]   - It was.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.060]   - Absolutely fantastic.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.540]   - That's incredible, by the way.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.220]   - You didn't screw it up the first time.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.220]   - First of all, I think that also kicks off the magic.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.420]   If you screw it up, and you're like,
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.220]   "Oh, maybe this is not for me."
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.940]   So for me, it really did kick it off.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.020]   - You started out on a high note.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.180]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.060]   But I tell the French fry part, which was a disaster.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.500]   So I cooked the French fries,
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.140]   but I didn't heat the oil first.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.060]   So I just put the potatoes in the oil,
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.340]   and I waited for it to heat up.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.020]   And I just was throwing up later that night.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.980]   Your body can't ingest that much,
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.020]   'cause it sucks the oil in.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:50.860]   - Oh, oh, wow.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.180]   - And so that was a disaster.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.580]   But at the time, it tasted good.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.660]   The real magic, which I also found was wonderful,
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.420]   was when I cooked, my brother, my sister, my mom,
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.700]   all very, very busy, very intense people,
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.540]   would sit down, and we would have a meal together.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.180]   And I was like, "Wow, this is a powerful,
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.860]   "it's a very powerful thing that I've now got,
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.660]   "where in no other way could I have that connection
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.700]   "with my family."
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.780]   I mean, obviously, we stay connected,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.260]   we're very close, et cetera.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.900]   But in no other way could we sit down
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.740]   and just talk about things,
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.940]   or talk about whatever's on our mind,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.500]   or just to just, not even talk,
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.660]   just to be at the table together.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.900]   And I've done that now through my whole life,
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.860]   my kids, still for my family.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.500]   And we'll do gratitudes at the beginning of our meal.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.980]   I think what kept me cooking,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.340]   what made my love of cooking so great,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.300]   was actually the fact that we would sit down--
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.140]   - Together.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.220]   - And be present with each other.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.900]   And I'm also just also hard with that, too,
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.100]   so I also get to be present.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.020]   - What is that about food that brings people together,
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.940]   and not just together, but really together,
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.980]   where you're paying attention?
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.820]   - Right.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.140]   - What is that?
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.300]   Why is it food?
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.780]   What else does that?
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.060]   Sometimes maybe alcohol can do that,
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.380]   which is a kind of food, I guess.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.740]   - Yeah, but I think alcohol is different,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.500]   because you use the standing when you're doing alcohol,
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.100]   so you're socializing,
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.940]   but it's kind of,
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.620]   you're just gonna stay more in the small talk zone.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.460]   - Yeah.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.940]   - Right, whereas if you sit down,
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.580]   and I see this in my restaurant in the kitchen in Boulder,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.340]   where we have every viewpoint.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.460]   Or we go to Denver, every viewpoint.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.100]   When we went to one in Chicago, every viewpoint.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.100]   And the physical presence of someone being right there,
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.860]   is people are just, they're just very different,
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.500]   absolutely different to what they are online.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.660]   I think we all know the difference between,
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.020]   you know, you send an email to someone,
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   and they misunderstand the email.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.700]   - Right?
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.780]   And you're, oh, if I just had talked to the person,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.900]   it would have been fine.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.660]   Well, this is now happening at scale,
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.060]   you know, with all of these,
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.700]   what do you call it, trolling, or whatever.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.460]   And I have, I've sat at the bar,
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.420]   and I've had a hardcore Trump supporter,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.060]   and I'm just curious.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.500]   Just like, tell me what, I'm not a Trump supporter,
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.580]   but like, tell me more.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.980]   And it actually draws the conversation out,
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.220]   because you're there for an hour or longer.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.420]   So there's no rush to get the answer.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.380]   And I think that's a big difference.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.400]   I've had one time where, just a couple months ago,
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.340]   I had someone, I was sitting at the community table,
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.580]   we have a community table in the restaurant,
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.260]   and he was, I didn't know him too well,
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.900]   but he asked me, did I know that 9/11 was a conspiracy,
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.840]   and it didn't really happen?
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.380]   - It didn't happen, yeah.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.160]   - And I was like, huh.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.500]   So actually, I was at 9/11.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.540]   I was, I mean, I was there, physically there.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.380]   So it's like--
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.200]   - Allegedly.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.040]   - There's no doubt in my mind.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.880]   - Okay.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   - But I didn't wanna interrupt his, what he had to say.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.360]   What he had to say.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.040]   So I let him talk for five minutes, six minutes,
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.500]   seven minutes, and again, you're there for a while,
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.520]   so you're not in a rush to jump in and argue.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.120]   And then I shared that I was there.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.180]   And I think because I had been willing to listen to him,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.300]   he was willing to listen to me.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.280]   And he, I don't know if he changed his mind,
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.380]   certainly didn't change my mind,
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.160]   but it was actually a pretty cool conversation
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.440]   to kind of get into each other's mind.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.640]   - Well, I think you connect on a different level,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.880]   not on the level of like the conspiracy,
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.560]   but on the level of basic humanity.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.400]   - Yes.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.560]   - Like that's what you really connect on.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.680]   And then it's almost becomes interesting and fun
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.160]   that you can exchange ideas, even crazy ideas,
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.400]   out there ideas, and kind of play with them.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.240]   - Yeah.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.340]   - We humans are good at that.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.560]   I like the term play with them,
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   because what you're not trying to do
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.200]   is shut the conversation down.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.640]   You're also not trying to--
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.480]   - Talk down on me.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.880]   Like, let me just be nice
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.220]   while I totally disagree with this person.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.280]   You can do that for a few minutes,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.480]   you can't do that for two hours.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.080]   - And there's something about food that completely,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.460]   I don't know, it must be evolutionary.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.080]   It makes us vulnerable in a way
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.280]   that even just standing there
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.000]   for a prolonged period of time doesn't.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.200]   There's something about,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   you know like when the animals gather to the water
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.040]   or whatever?
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.860]   - Yeah, right.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.280]   - Like this kind of experience where you're just like,
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.080]   all right, let's just acknowledge together
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.120]   that we need sustenance.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.960]   - Yeah.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.640]   - And somehow that kind of grounds us to like,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.360]   we're just a bunch of descendants of apes here,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.000]   just kind of like grateful to be alive, frankly,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.160]   and grateful to be consuming this thing
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.080]   which keeps us alive.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.840]   And in that context,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.200]   you can talk about all kinds of stuff.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.960]   You can discuss flat Earth and enjoy it.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.040]   - Absolutely.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.400]   In fact, one of my favorite things to do
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.520]   is you do like a Jeffersonian style dinner.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.120]   Like, let's say five or six people.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.600]   Sometimes people will break off
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.760]   into individual conversations.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.800]   That's actually when things break down.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.600]   So that's when you kind of go back to small talk.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.800]   Like, oh, I'm stuck next to this guy,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.320]   I'm just gonna do a little small talk.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.240]   What you need to do to really create a great conversation
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.000]   is one conversation at the table.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.200]   And that's where, you know,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.760]   there'll be some simple questions that I'll say.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.000]   I'll say, you know, what's your middle name?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.280]   And you'll be amazed at the stories you get from that.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.560]   But it's about creating vulnerability.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.400]   - Yeah.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.760]   - So they're like, oh, no one's ever asked me that before.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.000]   So then they become vulnerable.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.880]   And then something as simple as
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.440]   what's the most fun thing you've done recently
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.960]   and what is the most fun thing you're looking forward to?
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.040]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.680]   - And I have gotten into, with those prompts,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.880]   I've gotten into hours-long discussions on God.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.920]   I've gotten into hours-long discussions on love.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.320]   I've gotten into hours-long discussions on anger.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.120]   It's actually amazing when people are just asked a question,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.360]   like, what's the most fun thing you've done lately?
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.520]   Well, why would anger come up?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.560]   Well, actually, they're in a vulnerable place,
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.600]   so it'll just kind of come out of them.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.640]   - So you get to see this.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.880]   You get to see this at the kitchen,
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.480]   and you said Boulder, Denver, Chicago.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.840]   - Yeah, and we're gonna open in Austin.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.200]   - In Austin, that's what I saw.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.040]   When, when?
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.160]   - In October is the goal.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.440]   - In October is the goal.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.600]   Well, I mean, speaking of characters and human beings,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.760]   Austin is fascinating.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.280]   I forget how long ago, a couple months ago,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.840]   I was just sitting at a bar,
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.680]   and the two people were talking,
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.480]   and they were talking about Marxism.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.520]   And it turns out that they're anarcho-communists,
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.360]   which is a thing.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.560]   And I got into this conversation.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.200]   - Are communists the likes of drugs?
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.760]   (both laughing)
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.240]   - That's a good question to answer.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.440]   - I think I know some of those.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.120]   (both laughing)
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.320]   - Anyway, they were beautiful people.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.760]   I think they're local from Austin.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.560]   I don't, you know, I don't know the depth
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.800]   of their personal experience
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.920]   of the different kinds of communist-like systems,
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.600]   but it was fascinating to listen to them
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.160]   and get to know them and the humanity, the weirdness,
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.080]   like the characters.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.480]   It's just, I mean, I love it.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.600]   One of the reasons I really love Austin,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.480]   I decided to be here,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.640]   is just the cliche thing of keep Austin weird.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.880]   I mean, there's a lot of weird characters.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.800]   - I love it.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.920]   I think that, I've spoken to a lot of,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.160]   Austin and I have been here forever,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.480]   and I'm like, "Man, you gotta hold us accountable.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.720]   "We gotta keep this place weird."
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.560]   (both laughing)
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.720]   - 100%, which makes the restaurant scene great,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.080]   because you have all these characters come in.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.880]   It's great, so I look forward to that.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.520]   But you were saying, like,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.160]   you get to see humans in real life interact.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.120]   That's one of the beautiful things over food.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.920]   In the book you write,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   Picasso once said, "The meaning of life
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.360]   "is to find your gift.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.120]   "The purpose of life is to give it away."
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.880]   Then you wrote that you believe food is a gift
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.080]   we give ourselves three times a day.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.440]   Can you explain that?
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.160]   The gift nature of it? - Yeah, it's actually,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.880]   I think it's one of my most powerful life lessons,
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.300]   is we have to eat.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.040]   So it's not like you have a choice.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.920]   You have to eat.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.040]   So what I choose to do is I choose to make it a gift
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.840]   to myself for each meal.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.960]   And most of the time, the best gift is with friends,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.120]   with family.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.440]   So we'll have to cook some scrambled eggs in the morning
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.120]   with my daughter, or we'll have dinner with our family.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.240]   To me, it's a gift we give ourselves three times a day,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.120]   at least, but for the most part, three times a day.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.400]   Let's make it a good one.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.660]   - What makes it a good one to you?
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.580]   Like what aspect of it makes it a good one?
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.740]   - Well, first, definitely eating with people.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.480]   So that makes it a good one.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.620]   So eating in a restaurant,
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.900]   or it doesn't have to be my restaurant,
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.180]   where you have the energy of people around you,
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.760]   energy of the town, people you don't know,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.580]   creates a little bit of a vibe.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.220]   You mentioned the watering hole analogy,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.600]   that animals like sipping at the water,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.580]   but there's an energy to that
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.640]   because they're also like looking around going,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.580]   is, am I just about to be eaten?
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.860]   (both laughing)
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.860]   So there's, they're all in it together,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.660]   but we need to have water,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.460]   but there's also a little bit of tension as well
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.440]   in the background.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.860]   And I think that's what restaurants do,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.420]   is a very, very subtle version of that.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.760]   You're in a room with strangers,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.260]   and you're, yeah, you're a little cluster.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.020]   Okay, fine, you guys are connected, isn't it?
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.260]   But you're in a room with strangers,
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.800]   and it's just something that adds that energy to the meal.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.060]   - Yeah, you're a little bit wondering,
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.420]   like, what does everyone else think about our little cluster?
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   - Right, like, are we too loud, or just,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.020]   you also just, people are random,
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.300]   so something random could happen.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.100]   - And also, depending on your personality,
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.940]   if you're an extrovert,
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.820]   maybe you want to show off to the other clusters.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.540]   - Exactly, yeah, absolutely, totally right.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.340]   I mean, you know, look at the cowboy hat.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.780]   (both laughing)
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.280]   I mean, actually, I'll take my hat off
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.940]   when I want to have a quiet meal,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.580]   and I can leave my hat on when I'm--
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.700]   - Oh, so you're aware of the laugh.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.160]   - I'm aware of the effect it has, yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.820]   - Yeah, everyone turns, and it's like.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.300]   And then it's back to the watering hole,
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.740]   'cause when you wear a cowboy hat,
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.620]   you just might actually, not--
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.220]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm like, they're gonna get me first.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.660]   (both laughing)
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.180]   - At noon, I love it.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.060]   - I gotta tell the story.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.220]   So, just to talk to the craziness
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.060]   of being in the restaurant world,
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.940]   where, you know, you're sitting at a table,
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.100]   and anything can happen in a restaurant.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.500]   So, there's one time, it was like 15 years ago,
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.980]   the, this guy comes up to us and says,
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.400]   he would like to propose to his wife, his girlfriend.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   And so, we said, "Okay, cool, we've done this before.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.800]   "We'll make sure it's all set up."
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.840]   6 p.m. kind of reservation.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.480]   So, she shows up, and we give her a glass of champagne,
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.520]   and it's just, we didn't, obviously,
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.720]   didn't want to spoil the surprise,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.320]   so we're just doing everything we can.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.720]   But then he doesn't, then he doesn't arrive.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.360]   And then we're like, "Oh, man."
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.640]   Now we're like, "Don't leave.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.240]   "Can we get you another glass of champagne?"
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.820]   We're doing everything we can.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.420]   The guy was obviously earnest earlier,
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.480]   but just 'cause he stuck in traffic or whatever.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.300]   And out coming through the back door of the restaurant,
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.240]   which is, you're not allowed to come
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.860]   through the back door of the restaurant,
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.520]   a marching band from the school, the university,
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.720]   like comes through the restaurant,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.320]   you know, full-on brass band and the whole thing.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.000]   And, you know, he gets down, and he proposes.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.680]   And it's beautiful, sure, but it's also like--
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.800]   - Chaos. - Man, this is chaos.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.520]   This is insane. (laughing)
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.000]   And we would never have said yes to this
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.560]   if he'd actually told us what he was gonna do.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.320]   - Well, sometimes in life, you have to do it and apologize.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.440]   - You do it and apologize.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   But that toast to that kind of,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.800]   what's the crazy thing that could happen?
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.480]   It's subtle, but it's still there.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.760]   - So in 2004, you opened The Kitchen.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's an American bistro restaurant.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.840]   What was it like?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.640]   What's it like running a restaurant,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.400]   the good, the bad, and the ugly?
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.760]   What's the easy, what's the fun, and what's the hard?
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.120]   - I think the thing that I absolutely love
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.520]   about running the restaurant, not eating it,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.760]   but running the restaurant,
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.760]   is the tangible reaction from people.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.360]   And you also kind of know when you screwed it up.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.920]   And you also know when you got it right.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.800]   So even, it's kind of a weird way to say this,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.340]   but even if the customer's unhappy,
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.200]   you know whether you got it right or wrong.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.600]   It's not just about the food you're making,
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.120]   but it's about the person's psychological state.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.240]   And you'll do something that you're like,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.800]   "You know that that was not well."
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.400]   And their psychological state is,
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.240]   they're just in a very happy place and they love it.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.480]   And you're like, "Huh, interesting."
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.080]   That's not how I would have reacted to that dish.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.280]   And then the other way around, you're like,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.120]   "No, I got that right."
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.400]   And that person's just really unhappy today.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.040]   - Yeah, and it's so hard to read humans
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.320]   'cause you have to, if you got it right,
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.920]   that can look a million different ways
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.640]   depending on the emotional rollercoaster
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.200]   that human is living through.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.960]   Like I've been some very low points
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.640]   and I've gone to like a restaurant alone
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.840]   and just sitting there and be truly happy
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.440]   was just the Zen aspect of it.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.480]   And it was just a great steak or something like this.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.760]   And maybe to other people around me
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.920]   would look like I'm very unhappy
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.880]   just because I'm within myself.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.360]   - Struggling with your day.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.560]   - Yeah, within myself.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.720]   But I'm truly happy within that struggle.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.800]   So yeah, it's interesting, but you can kind of tell.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.720]   - Yeah, you can tell.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.080]   And you mentioned being at the bar,
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   one of the most gifts that bartenders really understand that
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.720]   you know, it goes beyond,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.640]   but what's also great about a restaurant
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.160]   is it goes beyond the one-time experience
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.440]   that you walk in and you have that experience
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.920]   is the good bartenders, they remember you.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.160]   Oh, you were in a few months ago
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.120]   and this is kind of your thing.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   You might need a little time.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.240]   And other people will come and they want a conversation
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.080]   or other people will come in
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.480]   and they're going through a divorce
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.880]   and they just want to be sad for a moment, have a scotch.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.680]   And it's like, it's amazing what you learn
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.960]   in the restaurant world to just be connected to humanity.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.840]   - Yeah.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.360]   What is that about bars?
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.880]   That's a different experience.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.720]   You said the table, the communal.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.860]   - The table is when you connect with people,
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.680]   learn about each other.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.080]   Bars, you can sometimes do that.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.200]   You can talk left and right,
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.960]   but you have the freedom to always break free.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.800]   Like you can say, "Oh, okay, great.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.680]   I'm gonna go back to my meal."
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.380]   It's kind of like, it's like a friend you can turn on
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.380]   and off at any time because the bartender knows that.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.220]   They're trained.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.820]   Like, if you want attention, I'm gonna give it to you.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.860]   If you don't, I'm gonna stay away.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.980]   If you want to be chatty, I'm gonna be chatty.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.880]   If you want to be completely in your head,
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.720]   I'll leave you in your head.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.560]   - But there's also strangers kind of next to you
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.500]   that you kind of, there's a feeling with a bar
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.980]   that you're kind of alone together.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.820]   - Yeah.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.660]   And you can reach out.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.820]   You can add some conversation or you can choose not to.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.700]   - And you can exit quickly.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.540]   - You can exit.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.360]   You can, exactly.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.460]   You can have a really good exit.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.860]   So, bars are wonderful.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.860]   And I love going to a bar by myself after work.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.340]   I might have a scotch.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.260]   Might not even have alcohol, just have something.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.300]   And I'll just, maybe have a snack or something
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.500]   before dinner 'cause I'm gonna go home
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.100]   and have dinner with the family.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.100]   And that 20 minutes is just an amazing state change
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.940]   from daytime to nighttime.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.740]   If I went straight home, I'm like still in my head
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.260]   and I'm just trying to get grounded.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.920]   And I'm just, I'm not as pleasant of a person.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.300]   So, that's another powerful use of a bar.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.940]   It's just like a transition time.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.500]   - Well, I mean, it would be remiss not to mention
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.560]   the other use of the bar, which is like
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.100]   when you go on through some shit in life and you just go.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.260]   I mean, that's sort of the, it's the cliche thing.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.940]   I've been, some of my--
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.780]   - Running a store?
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.600]   - Exactly.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.440]   - It's a real thing.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.260]   (laughing)
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.260]   - The bar makes the melancholy somehow rich and beautiful
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.580]   and you feel heard in the silence.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.420]   (laughing)
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.260]   - Yes, you feel heard.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.320]   Like I said earlier, the people going through a divorce,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.980]   they don't know where else to go.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.080]   - Yeah.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.920]   - These are mostly men.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.140]   Sometimes women will do it, but mostly men will do this
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.920]   and women have other ways of processing it.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.580]   But they just, they want a place to be sad.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.300]   They want a place where they could feel
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.580]   comfortable talking about it if,
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.780]   they're certainly not gonna go into too much detail,
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.320]   but they just wanna say something.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.160]   - Yeah.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.580]   - And the bartender is there for them.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.460]   - Yeah, you don't know where to go.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.700]   - You don't know where to go, exactly.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.060]   - The bar, yeah, you're right.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.140]   For men especially, it's a place to just go
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.340]   and just, I don't know, what is that?
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.180]   What is that?
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.420]   - I mean, I'll be honest, I still do it myself
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.420]   where if I'm at home and I don't have a work thing
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.580]   that I gotta deal with and I don't have kids
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.800]   and I don't have my wife or family around,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.540]   I don't often cook for myself.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.740]   I actually love going to a bar by myself.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.300]   I have a glass of red wine and I have,
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.340]   I usually don't have a starter, appetizer,
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.420]   I just have like a main meal.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.580]   And I just take in the energy of the space.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.980]   If it's my restaurant or someone else's restaurant,
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.060]   I just take in the energy.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.340]   And it's so much better than being home
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.780]   and what, turn the TV on?
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.300]   No, no, no, no, I wanna be out in the restaurant.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.860]   I wanna feel the energy of the town.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.780]   The other thing that restaurants teach me
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.700]   is they're the front lines of the economy
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.980]   or what's a better word for it?
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.100]   It's like the front lines of the energy
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.740]   of how things are going.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.980]   - Or like of a people's in general.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.300]   Like it doesn't necessarily mean this part of town
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.100]   but it could be the entire society.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   - Exactly, so you can go into a restaurant
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.860]   and I'll use a simple example.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.260]   And why is the restaurant empty?
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.220]   Ah, there's a football game going on
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.940]   and there's such a large number of people
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.260]   wanna watch that game that the restaurant is quiet
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.620]   or it might be like another like World Series or something.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.020]   And you're like, wow, that's so interesting.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.460]   And you can actually watch in America,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.980]   of course, American humanity,
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.980]   you can watch them move in their patterns
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.780]   just by being in the restaurant.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.220]   - And then another time you might be in a restaurant
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.140]   and it's just jamming and it's a Monday night.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.300]   And you're like, what is the energy
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.380]   that created this on a Monday night
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.460]   and maybe even on a cold February Monday night?
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.700]   What is it?
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.860]   And sometimes you can't find out
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.820]   but you can feel it.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.660]   And it's my front lines of humanity
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.020]   that I also just really love about the restaurants.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.860]   - Yeah, it could be empty, it could be full.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.540]   Empty bars, there's a magic to those too.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.380]   - Yeah.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.260]   - You could still feel that energy, I don't know.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.820]   - I actually prefer empty bars than full ones.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.860]   - It's just you and the bartender.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.500]   I mean, some of my greatest experience
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.420]   is just the quiet bar with just me and the bartender
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.100]   and they're doing their thing.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.380]   And they've seen so many,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.340]   I've almost like through osmosis somehow
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.180]   feel the stories that that bartender has seen,
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.500]   has felt, has heard.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.320]   - Yeah.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.160]   - And all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   I mean, that it's not to be sort of like spiritual about it
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.140]   but it seems like it's in the walls or something.
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.100]   Like there's the history is felt.
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.020]   - And then some of these bars are actually very old
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:03.860]   and it's wonderful.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.020]   Like there are many in Europe like this
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.700]   but there's a couple in New York City,
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.540]   a few hundred years old
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.900]   and they're still operating nonstop for that long.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.980]   And man, you feel it.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.500]   - Yeah.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.620]   Let me ask you some questions about ingredients.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.660]   What's your favorite ingredient to cook with?
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.300]   - For me, cooking is an art, right?
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.660]   So it'd be like asking me
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.660]   what's my favorite paint color to use?
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:30.340]   It doesn't, it's not that it isn't like there isn't one.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.740]   It's more like when there is one, it really is one.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.700]   You know, like there's peaches
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.820]   on the cover of this cookbook.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:40.980]   Those peaches, those were in August, Colorado peaches.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.460]   It just doesn't get any better than that.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.860]   - On that day, at that moment, that was the best.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.540]   - That was the best, but that only lasts for a week.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.700]   And then they don't taste so great.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.540]   - Yeah.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.820]   - But damn, are they so good in that moment
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:59.820]   and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.540]   - They look really good.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.620]   - They're so good.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.780]   - What's your favorite fruit?
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.980]   I love veggies and fruit.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.300]   What's your favorite fruit?
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.140]   - I love a smoothie bowl.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.340]   So I do sort of berries, raspberries,
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   but I use fruit more in the form of a smoothie bowl
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.660]   than I eat fruit that often.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.820]   I like an apple or a banana,
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.180]   but for the most part, I prefer like the blended.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.020]   - Not me.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.900]   I love the way you casually said it, like an apple.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.180]   - A good apple is pretty great.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.900]   - For me, it's a problem, I think.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.460]   Probably cherries, number one.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.820]   Probably, what are they called?
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.140]   Granny smoothie apples, number two.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.980]   - Oh yeah, those are great.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.020]   - But try it when, sometime, come to Colorado in August
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.900]   and when you try those peaches,
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.900]   it is like heaven has arrived in your mouth.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.140]   It is so ridiculously good.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.500]   - But just for a week in August.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.060]   - Just for a week, you can't have it all year long.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.860]   - What about veggies?
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.420]   You wrote that Chef Hugo that you worked with,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.060]   the co-founder of The Kitchen with,
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.820]   taught you the power of a good vegetable.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.260]   What's the power of a good vegetable?
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.060]   - So, I've trained in New York as a French chef,
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.180]   but it wasn't very much ingredients focused,
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.500]   it wasn't very much sourcing focused.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.780]   He came from the River Cafe in London,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.180]   which is one of the OGs of the Farm to Table,
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.620]   and still going strong today.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.740]   And he taught me the value of getting to know farmers
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   and getting to know vegetables from that farm
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.660]   versus vegetables from that farm.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.380]   And they're actually different.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.260]   The soil's a little different,
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.380]   the way they grow it, a little different.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.060]   It's the opposite of the industrial machine
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.620]   where everything needs to look exactly the same.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.380]   And sometimes you'll get carrots
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.620]   that are kind of ugly and deformed,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.500]   but there's much sweeter than the carrots you'd get
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.340]   for other purposes.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.500]   So, you'd make a carrot puree out of that,
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.500]   and then you'd take carrots that are more typical
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.740]   in shape and size, you might roast them for dinner.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.620]   So, it's the appreciation for vegetables in general.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.420]   I probably would say carrots is my favorite
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.620]   just 'cause that was an example of one
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.140]   where I've really had to learn how to use
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.860]   the different types of carrots that come from around,
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.620]   from all of our farms.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.020]   And it's fun, it's a fun ingredient.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.500]   If you just went to the Whole Foods
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.340]   or just went to a grocery store
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.900]   and you just got exactly the same carrot every time,
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.980]   less fun.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.220]   But go to a farmer's market and see what you get,
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.900]   and you'll see they're quite different.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   - Yeah, carrot for me is probably number one.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.900]   I have rigorous, detailed rankings for fruit and veggies.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.740]   - That's amazing.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.500]   - We'll get into it, I'm just kidding.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.980]   Well, I am the kind of person that would have
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.180]   like a spreadsheet for that.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.460]   - That's true, that's true.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.100]   - But I'm mostly just making fun of myself.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.860]   But I do love carrots.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:52.240]   I wish they weren't so full of carbs, but.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.860]   - Yeah, I'm just not anti-carbs.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.700]   You know, I think the-
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.100]   - Anti-carbs, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.340]   - Yeah, I think they play a role.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.620]   You know, like I have a great friend
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.740]   who's an amazing doctor,
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.620]   and he did some tests for me and everything,
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.500]   and it turns out I have a gluten allergy.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.180]   And I was like, okay.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.980]   So what that means is I shouldn't eat gluten.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.300]   It's like, yeah, it's like, okay.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.960]   But I also have hay fever,
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.620]   and that means I should not go out into nature.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.620]   So I was like, nah, I think I'm gonna go out into nature.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.740]   And maybe what I'll do on bread and pasta,
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.300]   I like the true carbs.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.980]   I'll just have it when it's really good,
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.660]   because when it's really good, it's really good,
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.120]   and you don't wanna miss that.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.340]   Most of the time, okay,
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.940]   find some crummy bread, whatever, I can skip that part.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.620]   But I find all of these diets that are like,
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.700]   no, none of this, or super this, super that.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.460]   I wonder if they're just like a,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.340]   people are just looking for something to hang on to.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.260]   But these diets have been around forever,
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.660]   and if they work, then we would know that.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.620]   - I think one of the biggest problems with diets
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.980]   is it adds stress when you do have
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.180]   that perfect bowl of pasta.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.980]   If you have categorized yourself
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.940]   as a low-carb eating person,
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.300]   you might be very stressed about enjoying this thing
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.620]   when you should just let go.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.940]   - Let go, this is your cheat day or whatever.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.780]   And I've heard that.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.940]   And actually, I have friends who do that, their cheat day,
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.780]   and I say to them,
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.320]   I'm only gonna hang out with you on your cheat day,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.760]   because that's when you're actually fun.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.360]   (laughing)
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I would say, for me,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.420]   there's things that make me feel really good,
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.420]   but they're not rules, they're not,
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:40.000]   they're like go-to favorites,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.980]   in terms of diet and so on.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.100]   For example, I've mostly been eating once a day.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:46.940]   - Oh, wow.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.180]   - For the longest time, but that's not a rule.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.500]   Like, it's completely flexible,
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.020]   and I've mostly been eating very low-carb.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.420]   - Yeah, but you must be eating a lot of food
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.340]   in that one meal.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.520]   - Yeah, it's not, you know,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.280]   because it's usually a very sort of meat-heavy,
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.960]   it's not, like, portions are not that big.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.160]   - Your body needs food.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.000]   - Yeah, body needs food.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.280]   So, you're talking about, like, 2,000 calories.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.920]   What you find out is, like,
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.280]   that dinner is, like, the most social time of the day.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I have kids in the morning,
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.560]   so if you have kids, it's for sure a morning experience,
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.920]   but if you don't, then you're right.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.680]   - Yeah, but like you said, I deviate.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   You know, I'm more afraid of missing the perfect dessert,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.820]   the perfect breakfast, the perfect bowl of pasta,
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.780]   pizza, all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.260]   I don't think of it as a cheat day.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.340]   I think it's a--
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.380]   - Well, if you're eating one meal a day,
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.820]   you can eat whatever you like.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.660]   - Well, like, I wanna make clear
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.480]   that it's not one meal a day always,
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.380]   and I'm, like, this very strict thing.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:50.260]   You always have to be open to the experience,
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.940]   to the new experience. - I love that, yeah.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.280]   - Otherwise, you do miss out.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.240]   Just like you said, hay fever.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.000]   I think if you wanna be really safe,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   you should never leave your home.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.660]   - Yes, we learned during COVID,
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.820]   if you wrap yourself in cotton wool in your basement,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.160]   you're not going to die from COVID.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.040]   You might die from a lot of other things, pure misery.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.840]   - Yeah, well, you might live forever.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.640]   - Right, we don't know.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.180]   - But it certainly doesn't maximize the joy.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.480]   Of whatever makes life worth living,
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.980]   it doesn't maximize that.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.060]   - You wrote in the book that Anthony Bourdain
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.380]   was one of your heroes.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:33.100]   Can you speak to what inspired you about him?
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.420]   - Yeah, he wrote a book called
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.260]   "Kitchen Confidential" in the '90s.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.160]   I was in cooking school at the time.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   It was so, he romanticized the kitchen,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.540]   cooking in the restaurant so well.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.300]   His writing is great.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.120]   He kind of got me into, like, oh, that's cool.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.200]   I wanna do that, it was cool.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.280]   So I got into cooking school, got more engaged in it.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.880]   And I had this FOMO feeling of,
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.840]   I wanted to experience what it's like
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.280]   to be in the back, when you're in cooking school,
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.160]   you are in the back.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.440]   They had a restaurant, we would serve people,
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.000]   but it's not the same thing as actually being in a,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   like a real restaurant, it's like you're in a submarine
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.300]   with your teammates, and you gotta win tonight.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.420]   Like, it's a real energy.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.020]   And so that was a big inspiration.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.900]   I followed him over there, so sad that he chose
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.820]   to end his life.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.660]   But I also had met with him a few times,
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.420]   not like one-on-one over dinner or anything,
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   but just met with him, and I just felt his love for food,
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:41.380]   and truly, just love for food.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.940]   - He gave the advice of don't be afraid, get excited,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.600]   and cook with love.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.240]   - Yeah, I've used that phrase,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.680]   especially the cook with love one.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.520]   I mean, you know, one of the things about,
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.520]   which we talked about this earlier,
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.360]   where you get quick, tangible feedback from a customer
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.840]   when you're in the restaurant.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.900]   I know when I didn't put love into that dish.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.360]   I know when one of my line cooks did not put love
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.000]   into that part of the dish.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.240]   I know when that expert person did not put love into,
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.880]   look, you know, double-checking the dish
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.740]   before putting it on the table, you just know.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.260]   And cook with love is, when you do it for your family,
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.740]   oh, actually, especially when you do it for your family,
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.440]   the food doesn't have to be perfect,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.780]   but you're cooking with love.
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.540]   - That's why you love scrambled eggs.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.900]   - I do that, it's--
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.500]   - That's in the book, "Kimball's Scrambled Eggs."
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.340]   - Yes.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.580]   - You promised to make me scramble eggs,
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.540]   and I'm gonna hold you to it.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.380]   - That's great.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.820]   (both laugh)
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.700]   - Cooking school, you mentioned,
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.380]   the French Culinary Institute.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:46.920]   I heard it was a bit of a rough experience, in parts.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.040]   - I would call it, it's not a rough experience in that--
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.160]   - In a beautiful way.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.300]   - Yeah, it's exactly, it's not like I'm a victim of it.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   It's rough in that they intentionally make it rough.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:03.040]   So the school costs the same price as Harvard to go to.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:08.360]   You show up, you have to, it's an 18-month program.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.040]   You are allowed to drop out at any time,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.240]   you don't get your money back.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.220]   25 people started, six people graduated.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:20.200]   And the people who graduated, I graduated,
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.000]   but man, there were times where I'm like,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.520]   I can't handle this.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.960]   I would literally say to my friends,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   oh, I gotta go to cooking school,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.400]   I'm gonna go get screamed at for the next six or seven hours.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.240]   - Yeah.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.880]   - And I had this little French chef who was my nemesis.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.480]   - Does he still live in your head somewhere?
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.640]   - He still lives in my head, exactly, he totally does.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.120]   He's like five foot two or something.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.480]   And I remember him screaming so much at me
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.400]   that he's like the short guy, I'm 6'5".
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.760]   The spittle would land on my face.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.880]   - Nice.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.680]   - And I would just have to sit there,
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.600]   or stand there, and take it.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.440]   It was a very humbling experience.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.120]   I did learn, though, that it's intentionally rough,
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.080]   so it took a little bit of the edge of it one day
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.480]   when that same chef had come over to me
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.080]   and said, "Move over a little bit."
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.320]   And I moved over, and he took my carrots, whatever,
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.160]   and started just chopping everything perfectly.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.720]   And then he said, "You can come back."
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.840]   And then he went over to someone else
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.320]   and started screaming at them, saying that,
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.840]   "Look, even Kimball can do this, and you can't do this."
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.880]   And I was like, this whole thing's like a psycho game.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.400]   So it did take the edge off when I realized
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.680]   that the guy was intentionally trying to break you down.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.920]   And they do this, apparently, in the Army,
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.120]   and I've not been in the Army,
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.920]   but they need to break you down.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.080]   Everything you know is worthless,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.440]   so that then we can teach you,
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.280]   and you can come out of it
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.880]   with what actually we want you to know.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.840]   - Are there specific technical lessons you remember
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.120]   you learned from that, sort of how to cut carrots,
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.120]   or how to approach food, how to prepare food,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.200]   how to think about food,
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.120]   how to carry yourself in the kitchen?
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.340]   - All of those things.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.280]   I think that one of the most beautiful lessons
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.200]   was actually scrambled eggs.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.120]   So there's different layers of chefs.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   So they're all master chefs,
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.760]   they're all very well-known people and everything,
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   but Alain Saltner was one of the chief, main, main guys.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.500]   And he just passed away, he was a master chef.
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.020]   And everything kind of stopped
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.140]   when he would show up in the kitchen.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.380]   And he would teach very few things.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.380]   And all of the other chefs who would,
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.660]   the same ones that were screaming at us,
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.580]   just like, it was like the Red Sea partying.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.640]   They have total respect for this human,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.100]   and he can do it every once.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.180]   And one of the things he wanted to teach
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.240]   was how do you make an omelet, a French omelet.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.220]   And it's really fundamentally the same thing.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.900]   It's a soft scrambled egg that you fold.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:08.120]   And the love that he put into the time with us,
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.040]   and of course he's a legend.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.980]   There were moments like that where I'm like, wow, okay.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.060]   He also, just like the other chefs,
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.180]   didn't have any concern berating anyone.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.780]   So he berated our master chefs.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.620]   - Nice.
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.260]   - Saying, I don't trust these people
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.900]   to teach you how to make scrambled eggs.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.820]   So I'm gonna do it instead.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.060]   (laughing)
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.660]   - What, I mean, can you speak to that?
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.300]   'Cause a lot of people hearing this
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.840]   would be like, scrambled eggs?
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.740]   Like, why do you need to be a master chef
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.180]   to really make scrambled eggs?
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.460]   - Yeah, it's a, well, first of all,
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.100]   for me, it's a learning journey forever.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.420]   So I make scrambled eggs,
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.460]   I mean, I must have made it 10,000 times or more, whatever.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.020]   - So it's like Gerald dreams of sushi,
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.940]   Kimball dreams of scrambled eggs?
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.020]   - Pretty much.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:02.020]   So I will wake up and be held accountable
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.140]   by my kids to make scrambled eggs.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.140]   So this happens every morning.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:11.140]   And it's, I know all the steps,
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:14.180]   muscle memory level kind of steps.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.820]   I don't know how much, well, I know it.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.340]   And then I'll cook it and it's very meditative for me
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.180]   because you have to focus.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.560]   So most scrambled eggs, soft scrambled eggs recipes
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.520]   are 10, 15 minutes to get them to that perfect softness.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.880]   And the recipe that I got from Chef Alain
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.640]   was something that you do it in 90 seconds.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.480]   But it requires total focus.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.520]   Like if you look up for a second,
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.100]   you're gonna miss, you're going to miss the perfect moment
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.520]   where you have to stop and get those eggs out of the pan.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.240]   Because once, 'cause the eggs will keep cooking.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.000]   And so it's this meditation.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.440]   And it's sometimes you hit it like perfectly.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.760]   But most times, it could have been a little softer,
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.440]   could have been a little firmer,
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.600]   could have been a little bit more salt,
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.520]   could have been a little bit more pepper.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.400]   And so what's really fun about the morning
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.240]   is my kids are kind of into it.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.680]   So they're sort of like, we critique the eggs.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.520]   - Yeah.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.340]   - Every morning.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.600]   - Do they have a rating system?
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.440]   We're back to this question.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.680]   - It's more like, and again,
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.000]   it also comes back to how do people feel, right?
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.920]   So my kids can be in a bad mood and they can be grumpy.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.720]   - Or it's like a Michelin star system, like wait.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.920]   - No, no, it's more like, oh yeah,
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.680]   I like my eggs a little more gooey-er.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.480]   Or yesterday it was this way,
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.360]   a little bit more salt, a little less salt.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.800]   Salt is usually the one that is,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.520]   because not all salts are equal.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.600]   So if you are used to working with a certain kind of salt
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.560]   and then you just are forced, for some reason,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.960]   you ran out of salt, so you use some other salt,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.280]   you actually don't know how to use it.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.040]   You really want to have the same salt all the time.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.680]   - Yeah, you have a page on salt in the book,
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.560]   which is fascinating.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.960]   - Salt is, you got to get to know your salt,
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.640]   you got to love your salt,
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.960]   and you got to use it over and over and over again.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.560]   And it will teach you how to use that salt.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.000]   Your own palate will tell you how salty you like things.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:14.920]   But if you change it up
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.760]   and you mix up a whole bunch of salts,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.480]   you've now multiplied your learning path.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.840]   So for me, my favorite salt is kosher salt,
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.960]   and I like to use that all the time.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.840]   And if I ever change it,
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.760]   I might sprinkle a little bit of molten salt,
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.640]   just a crunchy, sort of a flaky salt.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.880]   But it's more for that, when you're actually eating.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.720]   - For the texture.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.760]   - It gives you texture as well as salt, exactly.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.880]   You wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs,
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   but if you switch out your salts, it's a different weapon.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.600]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.840]   - You need to learn it.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   - I like how, you know, usually there's wine connoisseurs.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.240]   You're saying, going back to sort of farm to table,
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.280]   when you're talking about carrots,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.960]   in that same rigor and nuance,
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.560]   you have to consider the different farms involved
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.640]   for the carrots.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.480]   In that same way,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.080]   you have to consider the different salts.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:11.920]   - Yeah.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.880]   - With like-
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.640]   - And also not even, well, kosher salt's the same.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   It's the particular salt that you like, get to know it.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.440]   Get in a relationship with it.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.720]   It's like great.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.600]   You will learn so much.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.360]   - In terms of the measurement, the proportion,
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.800]   the amount of salt you put in,
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.640]   are you doing that like exactly,
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.000]   or are you doing it by feel?
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.920]   - So it's by feel,
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.160]   and that's where you get the relationship.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.840]   So in fact, I have a, in the cookbook,
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.500]   I have QR codes that people can scan,
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.320]   because what I struggle with recipes
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.920]   is they don't teach technique, right?
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.520]   They can describe the technique,
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.640]   but they don't teach the technique,
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.200]   'cause it's a technique, it's not a recipe.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.140]   And so one of the lessons is how do you salt a steak?
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.000]   And the answer is not here's a teaspoon
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.720]   and you do it this way.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.280]   The answer is use kosher salt
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.000]   so you can see with your eyes,
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:07.920]   'cause they're little flakes,
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.600]   how much salt is on your steak,
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.880]   and then taste it, cook it, and then taste it.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.200]   You know, do you think you didn't need more
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.440]   or you needed less?
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.880]   Okay, now next time, put a little more on
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.680]   because you can see it.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.920]   And it's about learning the fact
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.200]   that you wanna be able to see how much salt is on the steak
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.080]   so that you can then train yourself for the future
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.680]   of how much salt you want on your steak.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.520]   - Yeah, but then the steak
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.880]   and the salt kind of dance together.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.640]   It depends on where the steak came from.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.560]   - That's true, that's true,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.720]   or the thickness of the steak, that'll make a difference.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.160]   But for the most part, if you learn,
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.720]   if you're able to see it versus table salt, for example,
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.840]   this just disappears.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.920]   You just can't see what you're putting on your steak.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.520]   You can't really learn as a result.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.840]   - I think you talk about roast chickens
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.360]   where your love of food began.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.800]   Well, what about steak?
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.320]   - I mean, I love a good steak, it's so great.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.720]   - So in the French school,
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.160]   you add sauces and all this kind of stuff,
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.840]   and in boulders when you realize
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.880]   like there's a beauty to the basic ingredient.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.240]   - Yeah, like a good New York strip
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.660]   from a good rancher.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:18.920]   There's a lot of discussion, controversy
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.800]   on how cattle should be raised,
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:26.080]   and we have a very different approach,
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.800]   which is we know how our cattle are raised.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.640]   We go to the farm.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.760]   We get to know the rancher,
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.920]   and sometimes you do wanna have them be finished on,
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.360]   like they'll be grass-fed for the most part,
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.680]   but then there's some sort of cool recipe
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.740]   of food you're giving them
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.640]   that will then make them taste better,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.420]   and sometimes it is actually pretty good
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.120]   to have 100% grass-fed.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.960]   I've had some amazing ranchers
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.440]   that show me that the flavor is all there.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.200]   For the average person that might go
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.400]   to Whole Foods or a grocery store,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.300]   I think the simplicity of a good steak,
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.160]   it is important to get good sourcing,
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.180]   but also it's just good.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.680]   - What's your favorite cut of meat?
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.720]   It's New York strip, probably New York strip for me.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.080]   - Yeah, New York strip, yeah.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.480]   I like the fact that it's lean,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.560]   but if you want the fat,
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.200]   you can dive into that little strip of fat,
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.240]   or you can leave it alone
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.040]   'cause you don't want it that light,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:26.960]   and it's also a great steak for adding something,
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.040]   like if you wanna, you could either do a pepper sauce
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.000]   or you could do a lot of ground pepper,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.920]   which gives it a peppery,
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.980]   it's not sauce, but it's a peppery steak.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:40.980]   It's a really good steak for a canvas for other things.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.680]   - But the basic ingredients you're playing with
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.200]   is salt and pepper.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.240]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.260]   Actually, I will say there's another one, garlic.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:56.080]   When you can, this is my favorite recipe for a steak,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.820]   is you season it, both sides, salt and pepper,
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:04.680]   you saute it in a little olive oil, barely anything,
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.240]   and you're getting a nice, crisp,
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.120]   like a dark golden brown on both sides.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.520]   The other trick with cooking a steak is don't touch it.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.300]   You just put one side.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.600]   When you're ready to turn it, turn it around,
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.800]   don't touch it any other time,
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   but at the end, you take a dab of butter
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.560]   and you crush a clove of garlic.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.280]   You don't even chop it, you just crush the clove,
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.160]   and you put the two of them in the pan
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.360]   and you just roll the steak around in the garlic butter.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.080]   I think that's the one.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.760]   - Bold move, Kimball, bold move.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.280]   What do you, since you're in Austin quite a bit,
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.120]   opening a restaurant here,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.160]   what do you think about barbecue?
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.160]   It's kind of the Texas way.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.840]   - Well, I would say there's an Austin way,
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.560]   which is, and actually even Austin would say
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.120]   there's a suburb of Austin way.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.660]   I think that actually the adventure of food is wonderful.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.600]   I would absolutely say that Austin
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.280]   is one of the great food cities of America
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.880]   and barbecue is one of its gifts that it gives the city.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.480]   But you go to one and the other
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.920]   and you'll have a different approach.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.120]   And that's the part I love,
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:24.560]   is where there's a real celebration of the artisan.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   So you might go to one and they have a style that they love
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.280]   and they've been doing it for years.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.800]   And then you'll go to another and they have a style
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.200]   that they love and they've been doing it for years.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.320]   And it's not, they're still barbecue,
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.400]   but they're actually different.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   And it's really beautiful to see that.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.000]   And that's, I think that's what food culture is.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.560]   Like it just builds up over time
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.440]   by people who love this style of cooking.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.660]   - Well, I especially love the communal,
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.120]   like how they structure restaurants usually,
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.760]   or I don't even want to call it a restaurant
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   'cause it doesn't feel like a restaurant.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.280]   It feels like a tavern of some sort,
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.200]   like Terry Black's is like that.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.400]   - Yeah, they also have like paper towels.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.840]   Get as messy as you like.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.200]   And it's a whole roll of paper towel.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.600]   They don't even give you a napkin.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.720]   They know what you're getting into.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.600]   - Yeah, and there's just wood everywhere
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.360]   and it's kind of has this feel
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.080]   like this place has been around forever.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.040]   It's not changing.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.960]   I know it's the 21st century with the internet
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.080]   and all this kind of nonsense that you people are building,
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.600]   but really this is all about the same.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.280]   It's been the same for generations.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.220]   We're doing it the same.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.160]   That kind of feel like if you want to escape the world
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.880]   in that way and then truly connect with people.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.960]   - One of the other things that'll happen
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.840]   in a town like Austin is there'll be a barbecue joint
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.480]   that is just legendary, right?
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.400]   And then out of that will come someone
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.640]   who wants to do their own barbecue joint
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.480]   and they'll take a learning from that barbecue joint.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.640]   They'll open up a new one,
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.160]   but it won't be the same as the other barbecue joint.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.040]   Part of it is like, dude, don't just do the same thing.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.080]   Do something.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.440]   What do you have to say?
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.000]   But also part of it is if you're in the world of food
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.400]   as an art form and you want to go open up
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.160]   another barbecue joint, you kind of want to prove yourself.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.760]   Like I deserve to have a barbecue joint in this town.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   I know this is one of the holy grails of barbecue
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.200]   and people will follow you like they were following
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.880]   a musician or they're following an artist
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.200]   and they are excited to see what your version is
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.400]   and how well you can pull it off.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.120]   It's like, it's actually, that's what I love,
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.200]   that's what I mean by like a city with a food culture.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.280]   Austin has that.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.200]   - There's also like a legend to certain places.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.040]   Certain places are more than just the food they create.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.320]   It's like, that could be a burden.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.240]   They have to like live up to the legendary nature
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.360]   of the name.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.160]   - Our restaurant in Boulder, the kitchen is 20 years old.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.440]   We're very well known, we're very well respected
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.300]   and we do have to live up to the name.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.300]   I think that our restaurant lives up to its name
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.040]   in not just the food.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.760]   It's like you walk in and you feel the restaurant
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.760]   and that is also something we've just done naturally.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.280]   The space is a 120-year-old building.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.640]   Used to be a brothel and it was a bookstore.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.960]   Like storied history.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.880]   - This was a, literally, this was a mining town, right?
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.740]   So back in the 1800s, this was built late 1800s.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:31.720]   That sort of brothel, that was a thing.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.280]   And so there's an actual tunnel in the basement
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.760]   that goes to the local hotel
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.060]   that would be used for going back and forth
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.000]   between the hotel and the brothel without people knowing.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.800]   And the tunnel is now concreted up.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.720]   But you can go about 20, 30 feet into the tunnel.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.940]   But you go into the space and it's actually an old space
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.520]   so you feel like it's been there forever.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.400]   - Yeah.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.840]   In 2010, you had a life-threatening accident
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.600]   that changed the way you see life, the world,
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.880]   also the way you see food and cooking.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.080]   Can you tell me the story of it?
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.200]   - Yeah, so 2010, I was 37.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.920]   I had opened the restaurant in 2004
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.620]   and I had loved the restaurant world, loved it.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.420]   But I didn't really wanna grow a restaurant company.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.680]   That wasn't my goal.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.640]   And so I went back into technology
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   and I had gone from something that I love
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.880]   to something that I like.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.640]   For me, it was like chewing sawdust every day.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.800]   I just couldn't believe that I had gone from,
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.040]   that had changed my life, I had gone back into technology.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.600]   And now I do work in technology and I do love it
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.880]   but I found a better relationship with it.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.600]   But I was really unhappy.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.400]   From the outside, I was a sort of CEO of a hot startup
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.600]   but from the inside, I was just very unhappy.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.020]   And I was in Jackson Hole
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.640]   and I was doing these very aggressive snowboard runs
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.200]   and I'm, at the time, a pretty good aggressive snowboarder.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.200]   And I remember saying to myself,
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.320]   "Look, I've got kids, I need to chill on this."
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.300]   The next day was Valentine's Day.
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.640]   It's the next day, tomorrow's Valentine's Day.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   I'm just gonna have a nice day
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   with the family and my wife at the time.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.920]   And we went to a children's run.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.160]   You do the inner tube run.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.460]   And the tubes are small but everyone uses the same tube.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.320]   So I'm six foot five and my kids are four years old
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.280]   and everyone uses the same size tube.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.720]   It should have been a message to me not to get on this thing
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.240]   but I went and got on it
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.860]   and on the first run, and I went down,
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.440]   you're going super fast, 35 miles an hour,
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.120]   and the tube hit the braking mats and it stopped.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.200]   The little tube just stopped where it was,
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.480]   it just threw me.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.080]   My head was facing downhill
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.280]   so that's created the wrong center of gravity
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.960]   so instead of braking, it just threw me.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.800]   I landed on my head.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.760]   My head went into my chest, like compression into my chest.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.520]   Like down like that.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.320]   I ruptured my spine at C6 and C7.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:25.360]   And in like the blink of a second, I was paralyzed.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.400]   I was like, like what?
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.820]   You know, just like impossible to,
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.600]   impossible to comprehend.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.680]   And they take me, they put this big thing on my,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.000]   like halo on my head and they take me to the hospital
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.120]   which was more of a medical clinic.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.120]   And I'm just like, what is going on here?
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.360]   - Do you remember your thoughts from the moment it happened
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.120]   to like the way to get to, got to the hospital?
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.080]   - I remember being, so this is one of the things
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.040]   that actually the doctor said caused the most damage
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.880]   was I was thrown from the tube
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.440]   and I heard this big crunch sound in my body.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:11.280]   And I knew that I was hurt but I didn't feel any pain.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.840]   Which is, that's also, why wouldn't you feel pain?
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.560]   'Cause you don't, paralyzed, you don't feel pain.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.920]   And I'm face down on the snow
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.680]   and the snow is burning my face.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.800]   'Cause you know, you can't do that, you need something.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.840]   And I found a way to turn myself around
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.480]   so that my face wouldn't be on the ground
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.560]   but I knew I couldn't move.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   And that they said actually caused more damage than,
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.800]   well, obviously the accident created the opening
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.240]   but once you move your body,
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.920]   the blood goes into the spinal column at a faster rate
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.840]   and that is what caused my paralysis.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.840]   But I remember that and I remember getting
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.000]   into the ambulance.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.080]   - Did you think you were gonna die?
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.940]   At that, like in those seconds, minutes?
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.480]   - It was a different feeling of death.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.480]   It was more, it was more of a, what is going on here?
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.280]   Like it just was, it was more,
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.680]   like I can't make sense of what's going on.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:23.600]   It was, it was a moment when I got to the hospital
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.560]   and they did this MRI and the doctor comes up to me
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.840]   and says, look, we've done this MRI
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.080]   and so I'm now, now I'm in the hospital
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.320]   and I'm like, I can't move.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.600]   But I also don't feel any pain.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.480]   So I'm like, it's very confusing.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.960]   Your body looks like you can move it.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.840]   Like, see how I'm moving my hand?
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.200]   Like, it looks like you can do that
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.760]   and then it just doesn't move.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.560]   It doesn't, there's no, there's no feedback loop
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.400]   that it's not moving.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.600]   Your brain even thinks it's moving, but it's not moving.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.720]   It's like the worst, like the most terrifying thing.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.520]   So the doctor says, look, the way you broke your necks
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.840]   really, that zero degree angle, that is so rare.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.240]   But as a result, there is no twisting of the spine.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.760]   We think that we can get the blood out of your spinal column
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.320]   and you should get some or maybe all of your movement back.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.800]   And I was like, oh, okay, I think I'm gonna be fine.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.440]   I guess I'm gonna be fine.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.400]   And then I realized I had tears
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.600]   just streaming down the side of my face.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   And I was like, whoa, man, I have no idea what's going on.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.320]   - So this kind of intense state of confusion,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:47.040]   I wonder if it's a weird psychological defense mechanism
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.680]   of like taking you away
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.000]   from the obvious possibility of death.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.200]   - Yeah, it was a, for sure, all the defense,
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.720]   all of the defenses were up.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.000]   I don't know how else to describe it,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.320]   but there was, there was denial.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.160]   - Yeah.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   - There was this curiosity of like, why is there no pain?
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:13.720]   Like that's, when they did actually repair me and fix me,
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.200]   that was three days later.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   The pain was indescribable how much pain I was in.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.600]   But there was no pain for three days.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.960]   - (laughs) The human body is fascinating.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.400]   - Man.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.240]   - Wow.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.080]   - So they were able--
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.160]   - Yeah, so they did the surgery,
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.840]   but I had this very clear voice in my head
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.960]   that kind of determined that it's God.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.800]   I'm not religious,
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.760]   but I don't know how else to describe the voice.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.320]   And this voice was very clear.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.360]   You're gonna work with kids and food.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.520]   I'm like, okay, where did that come from?
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.680]   I'm like tech CEO, I have a restaurant.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.400]   And then we were working with some kids in schools
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.600]   with like some, you know, helping a local non-profit.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.560]   And he's like, no, you're just gonna work on kids and food.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.320]   And my good friend Antonio and my brother
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.480]   were in the hospital and I was like,
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.800]   I'm gonna work on kids and food.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.760]   'Cause they're like, he's crazy, he lost his mind.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   But not that they were, no one was arguing with me,
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.200]   but I was like, I'm just going to do that,
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.160]   I need to say it out loud.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.800]   And I remember resigning from my job
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.160]   as the CEO from the hospital.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.080]   And that was it.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.840]   It was just clear, it was a clear voice.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.000]   Wasn't for a moment, wasn't like a flash of light
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.520]   or anything, it was probably two weeks of clear voice.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.160]   - Of clarity. - Clarity.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.760]   Exactly, clarity and no monkey brain, nothing.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.600]   No monkey brain, just clarity.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.000]   - So you're not a religious person,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.840]   but you do call it the voice of God.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.120]   Who is that God, do you think?
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.120]   Like, who is that?
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.440]   Where did that come from?
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.880]   - Well, I've done ayahuasca and I've spoken
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   to what they call Mother Aya,
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.080]   which is another version of God.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:18.560]   It's a divine presence.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   It's maybe, I think it's a better way to say it.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.960]   I've also had this debate in my head.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.760]   Maybe it's just me, I'm talking to me.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   And it's my peaceful, more kinder,
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.880]   less caught up in the emotion of the day version of me.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.260]   Maybe it's me.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.880]   Okay, maybe it is, but it's there.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.240]   - But who are you?
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.440]   How deep does it go?
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.320]   What does you mean?
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   You could be, first of all,
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.940]   the depth of what the human mind even is,
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.600]   is a gigantic mystery.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.440]   Consciousness, all of it.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.280]   Who are you?
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.760]   So like, yeah, maybe it is you,
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.780]   but then maybe in order to build you,
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.360]   we need to build the universe.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.200]   - Yeah.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.440]   - You are actually a fundamentally a part
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.400]   of this whole human society.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.800]   So the pieces of humans that you've interacted with
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.160]   are all within you.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.640]   And then maybe the history of the humans
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.320]   that came before are also in there.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.080]   And maybe the entirety of life on Earth is also in there.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.440]   And whatever brought life about on Earth
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.480]   is in there somewhere.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.320]   So that's all you.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.560]   - Yeah, all of the, which is really true.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.200]   Evolution literally is true,
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.080]   that we all are, the photons from the sun came in.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.160]   - You're part fish.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.600]   - We all came from that.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600]   I think there's one,
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.760]   so one of the things I do is meditate.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.440]   And this was, I've been meditating for many, many years.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.600]   And the way I meditate is I sit
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.320]   and I listen to my thoughts.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.880]   And I simply just do that for 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.320]   And it just calms the nervous system.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.960]   And I might breathe and just be,
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.980]   breathe through, because it's been a stressful day.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.520]   And it's just a beautiful way to, I kind of do it around.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.520]   I remember I said I used to do a scotch at the bar
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.480]   after work, now I go meditate for instance.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.360]   A little less, a little bit better for my health.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.200]   But meditation I was taught was,
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.400]   Sam Harris actually taught me this,
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.520]   was not so much just about watching your thoughts,
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.900]   but realizing that you're a watcher.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.160]   You're actually a watcher.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.300]   You're not just, who is the person watching that?
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.600]   That's you, actually.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.840]   Your thoughts are floating through your mind,
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.260]   but you are the watcher.
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.880]   And I was like, ah, that's really interesting.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.040]   Okay, so I'm gonna learn that, I'm gonna be the watcher.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.540]   And what I learned was, I'm watching these thoughts go by,
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.840]   and there's a consistent other presence.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.920]   And I'm like, what is that consistent other presence?
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.360]   It's not a thought.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.320]   That is not a, it's not a,
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.160]   not something I can kind of let it float away,
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.360]   and it doesn't even want to float away.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.880]   It isn't, it's just a consistent other presence
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.920]   that I can watch and feel.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.880]   - So you are the watcher watching the feelings and thoughts,
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.520]   but there's also an other presence next to you almost.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.960]   - Yes, yeah, that's how I feel.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.320]   And it's a beautiful presence.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.640]   It's not a presence that is trying to intervene.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.200]   It's not a presence that is trying to tell you what to do.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.840]   It's just a beautiful presence.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   And that might be the thing, part of the thing you met
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.640]   when you took ayahuasca.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.360]   - I learned about Mother Aya where you have this experience
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   of talking to, actually, I would say the closest thing
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.760]   to breaking my neck, that feeling, was ayahuasca.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.840]   - Can you go through that experience?
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.400]   'Cause I'm actually traveling to the Amazon jungle
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.200]   in a month, I'll probably do ayahuasca for the first time.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.880]   - Okay. - So I need a preview.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.160]   Unofficial instruction manual.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.040]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.880]   So first of all, I think there are many different ways
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.720]   to do it, right?
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.760]   And I've done many, many different ways.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.840]   There's a very Western medicine approach
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   where you have doctors that look after you during the day.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.440]   You put an eye mask on, you're on a futon,
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.280]   and you really are in a Western medicine setting.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.200]   And it's, frankly, for me,
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.800]   has been the most powerful experience.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.080]   I feel the most comfortable 'cause I'm part
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.480]   of Western medicine in my upbringing.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.060]   The other extreme, but they're kind of in between,
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.840]   would be very, probably a Peruvian ceremonies
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.320]   where you're probably gonna go.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   Very much about, you do it in a community,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.160]   you do it with others, and you feel people go
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.220]   through their pain and their processing.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:58.480]   So I know the whole gamut, but the thing
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.840]   that I found most powerful about it,
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.120]   and profoundly powerful, I would say.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.720]   But first of all, it's non-recreational,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.360]   so no one should do this for a good time.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.180]   This is not a good time.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:13.360]   This is a very--
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.280]   - Almost traumatic, but in, again, a beautiful way.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.120]   - I was actually gonna say that word,
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.360]   but it's not traumatic, it's profound.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.900]   So it's more like you don't have,
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:30.800]   you really leave who you were before behind.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.800]   And then you become the person you will be afterwards.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   (laughing)
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.400]   - That's never an easy thing.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.240]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   And sometimes what I recall was arguing with Brother Aya
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.440]   and saying, no, I'm fine, what are you talking about?
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.520]   Like, leave me alone.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.320]   (laughing)
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.560]   And yeah, that--
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.640]   - How did that work out?
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.880]   (laughing)
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:05.880]   - Um, but before 2010, the accident,
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   the two transformational experiences you had,
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:14.480]   you were a very successful tech CEO.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.720]   Maybe go back to the early days with Zip2.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.480]   In 1994, you and Elon started Zip2.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.160]   Tell me a story of that.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.760]   - Yeah, so '94, we actually did a road trip
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.480]   around the U.S. to brainstorm about what we wanted to do
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.580]   after college.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.560]   - What was the road trip like?
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.400]   - That was awesome.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.160]   So we went from Silicon Valley to Philadelphia.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.000]   - Nice.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.840]   - My brother's old, like a really cool,
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.360]   it's one of those very old BMWs,
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.840]   not ones from the '60s or '70s,
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.440]   but the car didn't work, it would break down all the time.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:51.840]   But we had a blast, you know, we just,
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.960]   I remember going through Needles
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.360]   on the border of California and Arizona,
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.640]   it's a town called Needles.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.480]   It's the hottest place in America.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.880]   And the engine was not cooling,
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.960]   so we had to put the heat on.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.520]   So we did the heat blasting to keep the engine cool
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.520]   and keep the windows down
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.400]   because you can't stand the heat in the car.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.000]   But actually, the outside heat is hotter
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.440]   than the inside heat, so you're just in a furnace.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.280]   - Yeah.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.100]   - You're driving through.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:20.940]   - Just sweating.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.960]   - It was at night even, I can't imagine doing that.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.800]   - Oh, wow.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.620]   - In the day.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.540]   - Yeah, it was a wonderful, it took us a few weeks,
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.260]   I think three weeks, maybe.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.700]   - First time across America?
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.740]   - First, like a road trip like that, yeah, for sure.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.700]   But it was really not a road trip for tourist sites.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.420]   We went to the weirdest places.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.460]   And actually, I would say we didn't go to them,
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:44.340]   we broke down in the weirdest places.
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.900]   Because that's when we stopped.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.000]   - Yeah, did you meet any interesting people?
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.340]   - I remember we broke down in the badlands of South Dakota,
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:58.180]   about an hour from Rapid City, and that road is empty.
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:01.100]   And so, we actually slept in the car,
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.500]   because there was just no one around,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.620]   there were no cell phones in those days.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.140]   And eventually, a trucker picked us up.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:11.660]   I was just like, man, you guys are the dumbest kids
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.940]   on the planet, I was like 21, he was maybe 22.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.580]   But he was so nice to us, and so kind to us,
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.340]   and found us a mechanic in Rapid City,
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.140]   and then found us a tow truck.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.580]   And yeah, you find the most wonderful people.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:29.140]   When you're in a place of distress,
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.940]   people do wanna take care of other people.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.760]   - They help you.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.600]   - Yeah, they wanna help.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.460]   - And especially when you're on a road trip.
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.420]   'Cause I've taken a road trip across the United States,
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   and there's a part of people where they really love that.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.340]   I think part of them wants to do that also,
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:53.660]   wants to escape whatever the local, the struggles,
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:58.580]   just whatever the mundaneness, the struggle of life are.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.900]   A road trip is a kind of thing where you're like,
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.420]   you know what, I'm going to get away from it all,
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.100]   and I'm going to experience life in the full,
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:10.060]   the epic sort of Jack Kerouac way of seeing America.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.340]   The people, not the tourist sites, just the humans.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:14.940]   - Yeah, exactly, this was not tourist related.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.060]   We did, of course, when we stopped at Mount Rushmore
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.180]   at night, which you can see nothing.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.080]   - We thought that was hilarious.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.420]   We couldn't see Mount Rushmore.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.260]   - That's great.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.540]   - It was like, well, we physically were here.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.140]   We took a photo of us not seeing Mount Rushmore.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:31.980]   - In the dark.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.820]   You could just say you went to the Grand Canyon too,
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:39.980]   just at night, and just visit different places
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.940]   when the car broke down, I love it.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.740]   So yes, you took the road trip before finding Zip2.
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:48.500]   - Yeah, so I had an experience in college
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.380]   running a house painting business
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:54.300]   that, for me, was my first experience with success.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.220]   It was very, very hard.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.860]   It was a franchise where they teach students
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.220]   how to paint houses, but I was good at it.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:07.220]   I built a team of 30 people after about two years,
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:12.460]   and so I had a taste of, hey, I'm not unable to do this.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.740]   In fact, my most vulnerable place,
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:19.740]   I remember as an entrepreneur, was I had,
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:23.020]   I just loved the idea of Wall Street and finance.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.060]   I was kind of allured by it.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:27.300]   This was in late '80s, I'm in high school,
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.380]   and there was a lot of these books,
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:29.860]   Liar's Poker and others that came out,
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.620]   and I was like, ah, man, this is awesome.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.180]   These people must be amazing.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.040]   So I went to business school, and I busted my ass
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.140]   to get a kick-ass summer job,
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:39.620]   and I got a job in one of the main banks,
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.460]   and it was in Toronto,
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.900]   but it was like the original Wall Street.
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.780]   And I was so disappointed with the people that I was around.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.660]   I was just like, whoa.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:54.500]   I totally misunderstood what the banking world is.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.420]   It was a very large bank.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   I'm sure if I had gone to a more aggressive one,
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.780]   maybe I would have had a better experience.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.540]   And I say aggressive, meaning someone was paying attention.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:07.260]   Like, this was just people kind of showing up
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.100]   and not doing much, you know?
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.020]   And actually, this is funny.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.620]   So this is great.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:18.380]   So 1991, '92, so one of those summers.
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:24.660]   But the summer job was literally,
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:31.500]   they print out the sales for all brokerage houses
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.100]   for the whole company, like it's a pile of papers
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.060]   that's maybe four or five feet tall,
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:40.820]   and you have a pencil, and you add things up
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.780]   using your pencil and a calculator.
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:49.220]   And I had known about Lotus 1, 2, 3 forever.
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:52.780]   Excel was coming out, and I was like,
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.380]   hey, guys, you know that there's a different way to do this.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:57.540]   (both laughing)
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.620]   And they're like, don't talk to us, just do your job.
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.060]   Go do it. - Yeah, just use the pencil.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.140]   - So I went to the head of the data,
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.660]   I just asked, 'cause in those days,
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.880]   you had the manila envelope where you can,
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.940]   you just write the name of the person
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.340]   that you want this to go to, and it'll go to them.
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.900]   It's like email, I guess, but there's no filter.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.020]   So I sent a note-- - There's no spam filter.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.340]   - There's no spam filter.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.580]   So I sent a note, I wrote a little nice letter
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:28.220]   to the database administrator, who I didn't really know,
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.940]   and I said, would you be open to me saying hi,
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.740]   and maybe I can get access to the file
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.480]   rather than print the damn thing out and use a pencil?
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.340]   And she responded right away, and we hit it off.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.700]   I mean, she was great, and so she's like,
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.340]   of course you can, I can't believe these guys
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.420]   are doing what they're doing.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.580]   So for the first couple of weeks of the summer,
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:53.580]   I wrote code in Lotus 1-2-3 that would,
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:58.380]   it's gonna sound crazy, but you type in the date range,
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:03.100]   you type in the geography, and you type in the,
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.760]   you know, which part of the bank you care about,
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.600]   and it will literally just create a new spreadsheet,
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.760]   and it will just, the macro would print it out.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.640]   It was like a magic trick for these guys.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.160]   And-- (laughing)
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.000]   - Incredible.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.960]   - I know, I know, it's like, it's astounding that that,
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:24.560]   I mean, for me, I was like, guys, this is so obvious.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.060]   (laughing)
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:31.200]   And so I got all that done, and this job was supposed
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.700]   to take three or four months, because it's really,
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.540]   you're doing this with a pencil.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.540]   And now I'd created this macro that you could not just,
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.580]   not just do it, you could do it, you could tweak it,
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.540]   and say, oh, I want this area of the world,
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:46.060]   or this area of, or this month, or that month
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.660]   compared to that month, you know, all the normal things
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.220]   you could do with a spreadsheet.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.100]   And the software was on a floppy disk,
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.780]   and I was like, here's the software,
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.860]   and just put it into your computer.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.940]   All right, now open 1-2-3, and it just pops up
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.960]   with a little box that type in your dates,
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.060]   and the whole little, I coded a little thing like that.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:11.060]   And what I was astounded by was,
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:14.440]   not so much that it was a magic trick,
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.860]   it was the lack of appreciation for innovation.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:22.080]   They just looked at it, they were like, huh, that's nice.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.900]   And I was like, you just, we're gonna have someone
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:30.700]   spend hundreds of hours doing something,
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.220]   and now it's something you can do in a minute.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.900]   - Yeah, if that doesn't fuel you with excitement.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.620]   - Yeah, like, if that doesn't move your needle,
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.540]   what the heck?
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:42.180]   And so I was really disappointed with the banking world.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:44.060]   Anyway, so that was, but that was also fun.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.560]   - It's such a good example, though, yeah.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.340]   And then also see the possibility of where that goes.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.020]   - But then, so then I got back to business school,
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.420]   and I canceled all of my business classes,
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.300]   like possibly could, but I was actually in business school,
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.900]   so I couldn't cancel them all.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.380]   All finance courses, I was like,
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.100]   I'm done with that industry, I'm not going back.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.100]   So the vulnerable part for me was,
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.500]   my whole family's full of entrepreneurs,
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:09.780]   and there was this franchise to do house painting,
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:14.020]   and I genuinely was afraid that I wouldn't be good at it.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.460]   And I was like, wow, I really am afraid of failure.
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.380]   It's very easy to avoid entrepreneurship,
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.740]   but if your whole family's entrepreneurs,
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:27.740]   you go in and you aren't good, I was really afraid.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.720]   - You're gonna have to face that failure
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.220]   every time you meet your family.
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:37.220]   - Yes, and it's, our family are wonderful and everything,
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:43.000]   but pretty much everyone's an entrepreneur.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.500]   And of course, not everyone's perfect,
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:48.420]   not everyone's doing it successfully all the time,
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.660]   but when you're young and you wanna prove yourself,
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:55.780]   it really was putting my heart on my sleeve.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.020]   I started the business in this part of Toronto,
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.700]   and for the first, so you paint the houses in the summer,
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.740]   but you do all your sales pre, before the summer,
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:09.400]   and all the way 'til April, I was just not succeeding.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.420]   And I was like, oh, I'm like, oh my God,
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.120]   I'm just gonna fail.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.920]   And I remember that, I was like,
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.760]   my whole nervous system was like, I'm a failure.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.060]   And I remember I had this general manager
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.420]   who, he was like, look, Kimball,
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.900]   you seem like you know what you're doing,
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.420]   why are you not making any sales?
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.980]   And so he actually went with me on a few sales calls,
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:38.420]   and I was like, and he was like, oh, you're,
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.260]   he was great, you're doing this wrong,
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.320]   you're doing that wrong, you're doing this wrong.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.340]   And changed those three things.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:50.340]   And it was like a watershed moment,
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.640]   just like, all of a sudden,
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.260]   and I just followed the instructions
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.020]   of what this guy had told me.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.700]   All of a sudden, every single sale I would make,
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:03.860]   I was like, I can't believe that I,
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:09.340]   it was really my lack of humility
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:11.120]   to learn from someone else.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.580]   I was like, no, I'm gonna prove
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.120]   that I can do this without your teachings.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.740]   And I was gonna fail.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.540]   - So to you, that humility is essential
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.900]   for the entrepreneur, especially young.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:29.620]   - I would say if we have an openness to learning,
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.200]   which does require humility,
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.900]   you course correct,
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.820]   or you help get other people to help you course correct.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.100]   But it does start with humility,
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.220]   because if you try and pretend you have all the answers,
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.580]   you don't.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:48.300]   - So you went from that to founding Zip2,
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.580]   that was an interesting time in the history of tech.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.420]   - Yeah.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.980]   - I mean, what was it like,
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:57.980]   you mentioned the first people to look at a map,
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.460]   basically directions.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.580]   - Yeah, so mapping had been on the internet,
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.580]   but vector-based mapping had not,
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:07.340]   so that's the ability to zoom in or zoom out,
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.160]   and it's really data versus an image that comes across.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.900]   And we went to this company called Navtech,
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.940]   my brother and I, and we just asked for the data,
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:18.100]   and they, this is Silicon Valley,
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:20.700]   they wrote us a one-page letter that we had to sign,
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.560]   and said, "Here's all of our data.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.580]   "We own it, you don't own it,
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.280]   "but you can use it on the internet,
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.800]   "and if you ever make any money on it,
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.900]   "you have to call us."
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.900]   That was it.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.420]   And we're like, "Okay, that sounds great."
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:35.100]   So we put it up on the internet,
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:38.420]   and back in those days it might take 60 to 120 seconds
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.680]   to actually give you an answer back.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.540]   But it was amazing, the door-to-door directions,
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:48.400]   the ability to take a map and zoom in and zoom out.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.600]   We use these things 10 times a day now.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.180]   It was amazing.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:59.140]   We were the first two humans to see it on the internet.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.900]   Like, this stuff didn't even exist to the world.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:03.300]   Like, Navtech was building it for Neverlaw,
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.140]   for Hertz Neverlaws,
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:06.020]   which would come out a few years later.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:09.060]   This was not something that people knew existed.
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:11.340]   This was something we discovered that it existed.
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:12.740]   Everyone was like, "Well, let's put it on the internet
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.500]   "and share it with the world."
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.820]   - What did the two of you feel like
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.260]   to see that magic?
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.100]   Did you know?
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.100]   - It was amazing.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.740]   It was like, "What?"
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.420]   - Like, did you, I mean, the amazing,
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.740]   just that it's cool,
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.900]   but also that you could see the future,
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.980]   that this could transform.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.420]   - I don't think people understand.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.500]   Before this moment,
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.700]   you could not be told your directions.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.100]   You just could not.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.140]   Today, we live in this world
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:47.020]   where we're told our directions all the time.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:48.300]   Before this moment,
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.900]   you could not be told your directions,
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.940]   and all of a sudden, you could.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.460]   It wasn't like a little thing.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:59.380]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of things that we,
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.220]   once we have, we take it for granted,
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:05.100]   and that takes like a day for people to transition.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:05.940]   - Totally.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.300]   - It's like, boom, oh, okay, cool.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:10.300]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.740]   - And it's when you see,
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.020]   maybe when you're one of the first humans
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:15.880]   to see that thing, you're like, "Holy shit."
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.380]   - "Holy shit, this is going to be used
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.260]   "by everyone all the time forever."
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.020]   - So, Zip2 was a success.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.260]   - I would say it was a success,
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.580]   but it was also a very hard company to build,
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.020]   and I mean it because the internet
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:32.440]   in those days was a boom time.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.580]   We were being funded,
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.400]   but you couldn't make any money.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:40.700]   And so, it was actually really hard.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:45.700]   The constant outside criticism that we aren't for real,
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.860]   this is not going to survive, this is not going to,
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   and it started to feel that way.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:53.620]   We're like, "Wow, man, this is a,
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.620]   "we are doing something that is great
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.700]   "that people are using."
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.220]   And we were a top 100 website.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.780]   Most of our work was through folks like the New York Times,
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.540]   so we were even much, much busier than that.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.540]   But there was just no money in it.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.860]   And even today, you go to Google Maps,
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:10.680]   there's no money in it.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   It's just local search that is needed for everyone,
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.100]   and so it became an add-on to search.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.200]   But even remember in those days,
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.500]   you couldn't make money at search either.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.940]   No one had figured out AdWords or anything,
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.260]   didn't realize how big of a business this was,
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.480]   but we all knew this was a thing,
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.340]   and everyone was using it.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.900]   - But didn't quite know how to make money.
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.260]   - Couldn't make money.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.060]   When we got acquired, it was a bittersweet moment
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:39.540]   because Compaq that owned UltaVista wanted to merge,
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.660]   so that's sort of regular search,
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:44.160]   with the best search engine at the time, pre-Google,
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.620]   with Zip2, which would be the best local search,
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:48.280]   and it would be a Yahoo killer.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:53.700]   And the Compaq just wanted to make money
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.200]   by taking the company public,
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.220]   but they wouldn't give us any stock.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.020]   They paid us cash return, actually very well for us,
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.060]   but because the whole internet bubble burst,
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.420]   and we didn't know that at the time.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.260]   And so it was bittersweet
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.860]   because they essentially wanted our company,
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.620]   and we were welcome to stay,
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:14.420]   but you don't have to.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.040]   And that was a pretty rough feeling.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:22.500]   - But in retrospect, it opened the door to--
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:26.700]   - It set us up for an incredible platform
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.540]   to go do beautiful things.
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:33.380]   - You invested in X.com that eventually merged with PayPal.
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:35.380]   That's a fascinating story there,
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.020]   also fascinating on many levels,
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:41.700]   including the fact that the current social media company,
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.100]   formerly known as Twitter, is now called X.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.600]   There's a, history has a rhyme to it.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.980]   Like, it's kind of all hilarious in a certain kind of way.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.620]   You invested in and helped sell
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.720]   a lot of the initial products for Tesla.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:00.940]   - Yeah, I still sit on the board of Tesla.
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:03.100]   Tesla is 20 years now, isn't that amazing?
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.180]   - 20 years. - Yeah.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.700]   - From the Roadster, the initial Roadster,
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:07.540]   to what-- - I still have
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.380]   the first business plan.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.700]   So I didn't join as a founder,
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:13.460]   I joined as a founding board member.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.460]   And so I actually, I didn't write the business plan.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.040]   I got to read it, and I still have that.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.180]   I still have it as a part of history.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:22.140]   - Did you see the future at that time?
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.980]   Like, the company that Tesla is today,
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.900]   could you have possibly, could you, Elon, imagine it?
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.460]   - No, no, I certainly didn't.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:35.460]   What I saw in it was a real, for me personally,
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:40.620]   I was really upset that General Motors
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:42.660]   had killed their EV car.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.500]   There's even a movie called "Who Killed the Electric Car?"
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:50.500]   And I knew that the physics of electric
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.420]   is perfectly fine.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.280]   I mean, there's no reason why you couldn't
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.500]   use an electric car to drive around.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:00.780]   What resonated with me with the business plan
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:03.540]   was take an electric motor,
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:06.140]   which is really a high-performance motor,
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.140]   and put it in a sports car,
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:10.140]   and sell it at a high price as a way
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:11.580]   to enter into the market.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.360]   Whereas what others had been doing,
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.860]   at least General Motors had done,
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:18.180]   is you put it into a really crummy car,
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.180]   and you sell it as a commuter vehicle
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:22.020]   that doesn't really work that well,
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:23.180]   and looks ugly as well.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.160]   They really did everything they could
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.780]   to make that thing as ugly as sin.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:30.020]   And then I was like, okay, I get it.
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.800]   We're gonna take an appropriate technology
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:37.220]   and put it in an appropriate car so that when you have,
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.500]   because electric motors, they have constant torque,
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.020]   you get incredible power.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.420]   Put it in a car that looks like a sports car.
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:49.500]   The idea was to put it in the Lotus Elise,
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.520]   redesign it a bit.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.380]   And even at that point, I was like,
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:56.620]   this is theoretically good,
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.020]   so I'm gonna join and help build it.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.340]   But I was not convinced that it would work,
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.440]   because General Motors had done such a terrible job
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.600]   of making everyone think that these things are terrible.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.160]   But I was curious.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.620]   And the time that I fell in love with the company
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:15.620]   and its mission was, I was driving in what's called a mule,
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:21.480]   where we take a car and we take the engine out,
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.600]   and we put in an electric drivetrain.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:28.160]   And I drove it, even the dashboards, there's no dashboard.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.040]   It's just like, you got a steering wheel,
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.240]   and it's just like wires and everything around.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.440]   And I remember there's a street we were on
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.240]   in the Bay Area called Bing Street,
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.200]   and I was just like, no traffic.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.680]   So I'm just gonna drive this, I'm gonna floor it,
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.400]   see what happens.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.560]   And it was a feeling I'd never experienced before.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.600]   Gasoline cars have an inertia to them,
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.540]   so you go (imitates engine revving)
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:56.640]   This is just, it was like being shot out of a cannon.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.120]   And I was like, okay, this is gonna be real.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.200]   - It's a very spaceship-like feeling.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.040]   - Yeah, it's like, whoa.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.940]   It's like the G-force pulls you back.
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:10.080]   So I was like, okay, this is gonna be great.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.000]   This is gonna be an interesting,
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.440]   we're gonna create something interesting here.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.480]   I think the real transformative thing for Tesla
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.480]   was the Model 3, when we were able to get the price down
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.360]   for the world.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.320]   - And that was also one of the most challenging
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.840]   - Oh my God. - periods for Tesla.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.680]   - And you were dying.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.600]   I mean, we were borderline bankrupt
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.080]   like two or three times that year.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.720]   I mean, it was just, and everyone was hating on us
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.360]   about whether we'd get that done.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.500]   The Model 3 today is incredibly affordable car,
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.500]   like 300 bucks a month kind of lease and $3,000 down.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.480]   That's where you get the scale.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.720]   That's where you get people who,
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.680]   and by the way, it's a great car.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.760]   It's even a better Model 3 now than it was five years ago.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.360]   We don't function the way car companies function, right?
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.600]   We function more like how an iPhone company, how Apple works.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.120]   So our Model 3 today is,
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.520]   this year is better than last year.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.520]   It's like way better.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.600]   And we just keep getting better.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.480]   - And the software is a fundamental part of the car
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.880]   and the software keeps improving.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.120]   - Exactly, and we can upload over the air.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.200]   - Which was one of the things
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.000]   that people don't often acknowledge.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.160]   It's the over the air updates.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.000]   - Yes. - It's like
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.840]   a revolutionary thing.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.200]   - Yes. - It's not just the autopilot.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.680]   To me, it's like the over the air updates
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.800]   is even bigger thing than autopilot,
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.760]   in this like moment of history,
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.180]   because you basically turned a car into the iPhone.
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.080]   - Exactly, it's an iPhone with wheels,
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.960]   but actually talking about autopilot,
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.880]   like right after this interview,
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.320]   I'm gonna go test out the latest Model 3.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.920]   - You're gonna get driven around by a robot.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.540]   - I'm gonna get driven around by the car.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:52.240]   I'm gonna say, I wanna go to this barbecue joint.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.860]   Take me there and park me there.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.320]   And I'm gonna see how it is.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.900]   And this is the latest Model 3
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.280]   that we have out into production.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.640]   Anyone can buy it.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:02.840]   And it's super affordable.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:03.840]   And it's like, okay.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.240]   Full stop driving is a journey, right?
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.160]   It's not like there's a destination.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.320]   It's a journey forever.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.840]   So let's see where we are on the journey today.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.320]   - And there's been a bit of a push and pull
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.980]   between you and Elon in terms of levels of optimism
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:23.360]   about deadlines and so on, timelines,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.100]   about when we'll arrive at the destination.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.180]   I like that you said it's a journey.
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:29.560]   For Elon, there's a destination.
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.000]   - Right, exactly.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.880]   - And that destination is tomorrow or yesterday.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.720]   - I think that's a really good insight.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.900]   I actually live with this concept of a growth mindset
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.440]   versus a fixed mindset.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.640]   And it's a philosophical term
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.600]   where fixed mindset is about the destination.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.520]   And growth mindset is about learning on the journey.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.400]   And I think that I'm a happier person
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.920]   because I take that learning on the journey approach
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:03.840]   versus really frustrating if you're always,
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.040]   it has to be about the destination every time.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.560]   - The nice thing about destination,
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.920]   at least from my personal perspective
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.760]   as like a programmer, engineer,
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.080]   is like it puts a little fire under you to get shit done.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.040]   Like if there's a clear deadline of a destination,
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.440]   you feel the anxiety of it.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.200]   - I would say that I still do that,
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.440]   but I call those forcing functions instead of destinations
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:29.040]   because you're just forcing people to crank
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.400]   on some code or cookbook or whatever
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.760]   because you have a date.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.240]   And oftentimes there's a reason.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.360]   I mean, it's 20th anniversary,
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.680]   you want to get the cookbook out.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.760]   We have a reason.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.400]   We didn't make this up out of thin air.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.200]   And so yeah, that does push you.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.980]   But just because we have the cookbook
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.160]   doesn't mean it's a destination.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.740]   It means it was a forcing function to get it out there.
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:53.280]   Now we're on the journey.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.720]   - Speaking of journeys, I have to ask you about SpaceX.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.600]   I mean, the journey that all of humanity's on.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.200]   - Seriously, that is a book about a journey.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.200]   That is incredible.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.360]   - It's an interesting moment in the history of humanity
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.520]   that perhaps hopefully will become
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.920]   a multi-planetary species.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.600]   But SpaceX is also a company.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.960]   You invested in SpaceX.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.520]   You were side-by-side with Elon
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:21.940]   through the highs and the lows,
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.180]   through the lows and the highs.
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:28.060]   So what were some memorable challenges?
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:32.180]   What were some low points from the history of SpaceX?
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:37.180]   - One of the hardest times in SpaceX was
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:41.320]   we were in the mid-Pacific in KwaZulun.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.580]   And my brother had sold PayPal.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.040]   He'd done well financially, but in the rocket world,
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.060]   that money goes away really quickly.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:53.060]   And we were in this military base in KwaZulun.
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:57.900]   And I think it was the second rocket that blew up.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:58.900]   I'm not sure.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.940]   But we didn't have infinite resources.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:04.140]   I certainly didn't have the resources.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.740]   I mean, I'm there to support, brotherly support.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:11.980]   So every rocket launch was do or die.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:14.460]   And the first one had blown up.
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:17.860]   And so the second one,
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.140]   I think it was the second one, blew up.
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.400]   And it was so depressing.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.820]   It was just like, ugh.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.860]   And there's nowhere to go.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.340]   There's no distraction.
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:30.820]   You're on this military base.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:31.660]   You don't really socialize.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.660]   So it was just, we were all together.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.580]   And I had gotten to know,
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.140]   for me, I'm not part of the team.
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.620]   I'm just there for emotional support or whatever,
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:41.860]   'cause it's cool.
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:44.900]   And so I got to know a couple of people locally,
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:48.940]   and got to know this one guy who had a mobile home.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:51.900]   Best view in the world, but it's just a mobile home
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:54.780]   with a patch of grass next to it.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.640]   And I was just desperate to find food
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.020]   that wasn't from the cafeteria,
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.980]   'cause this is the worst food you can imagine.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:04.780]   And so I met him, and he showed me
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:07.260]   this little tiny little grocery store,
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.020]   which had a few things, like canned tomatoes.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.220]   This is, again, you're in the middle of nowhere.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:13.620]   So it's nothing fresh.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:18.500]   And I made this dish that was kind of a version of a,
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.820]   like an Italian version of chili.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.700]   You know, just baked beans, and sweating onions,
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:25.100]   and then tomatoes.
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:27.940]   And it was a big pot of food,
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:30.300]   'cause it's a group of people.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.620]   We didn't even have a table.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:34.140]   And we just put the big pot in the middle,
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:35.460]   and we had our little paper plates,
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:37.780]   and we took a scoop as we needed it.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.060]   And it was really the gathering place of,
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:44.420]   like food brings people together in the most difficult times.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:46.260]   And it was one of my favorite memories,
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.980]   because I was able to bring my gift
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:52.180]   to this group of incredible people
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:55.980]   that their hearts were broken, you know?
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:59.380]   And to sit there and share a meal,
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:02.340]   and feel the life kind of come back into us.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.180]   And by the end of the night,
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.660]   we're actually having a good time.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:08.140]   - What a fascinating contrast of rockets
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:11.540]   kind of representing the peak accomplishment
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.560]   of human beings as a society,
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.780]   and then returning to the thing
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:18.940]   that is the foundation of human society,
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:19.780]   which is that communal experience.
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:21.980]   - That communal vulnerable connection.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:23.940]   Like we mentioned vulnerability earlier.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.500]   The most vulnerable place,
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.500]   actually that's when you have
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.300]   some of your most beautiful meals.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.900]   - Yeah, the descendants of apes
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.940]   gathering around some baked beans.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.220]   - You're right. (laughs)
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.300]   - After watching a rocket explode.
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:36.740]   - Yeah.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:39.140]   - What gives you hope about the future
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:42.180]   of this whole thing we've got going on, humanity?
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:44.380]   - If you look at how things have changed
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:46.080]   over the past, say, 50 years,
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.340]   you can clearly say, oh wow,
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.300]   poverty rates have gone down,
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:55.460]   infant mortality's gone down dramatically.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.340]   All these things have gone down a lot.
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:01.560]   So if you look at it on a daily basis,
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:04.800]   you can tell that life is very dramatic.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.620]   You know, whether it's something's blowing up on X
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.780]   or on some of the newspapers or whatever,
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:14.220]   and you can really get caught up into it.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:18.340]   But if you look back over the past few decades,
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.700]   things are getting better.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.540]   And I mean at the fundamental level.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.340]   Like, are less people hungry?
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:29.040]   Are more people, are they more,
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.260]   is there, I mean there is war going on, of course,
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.000]   but are there less wars? Yes.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.220]   And so I think that,
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:42.540]   I think if we all just step back a little bit,
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:47.540]   it's less about hope, it's more perspective and reflection.
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:52.580]   And if I do see a problem,
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.620]   like in case of the obesity epidemic,
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:56.180]   I work really hard to help with that.
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.820]   I work, our nonprofit's called Big Green,
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:01.900]   and we work with 150 nonprofits around the country
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.500]   to help Americans grow food again,
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.560]   get connected to their food,
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.100]   because I really believe growing food changes your life.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.420]   And so, okay, let's go do that.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:13.140]   So then, so I'll help out where I think
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.140]   we really can make a difference.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.660]   But if you step back a little,
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:18.600]   things are actually getting better.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.940]   It's just a bumpy ride.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:24.020]   - Yeah, and for those of us watching all of this,
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.300]   I think I would love to see more celebrating
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.860]   of the people that are helping.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:32.620]   The people that have found their way of helping
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.680]   and just celebrating those people.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.700]   - Yeah, well, I would also,
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:36.180]   actually, it's a really nice point.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.540]   I have learned that you really wanna
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.620]   celebrate your successes.
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:43.020]   Because even in the greater scheme of things,
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.160]   I've learned this in the startup world,
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.580]   where you're constantly facing death.
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.260]   You know, like, why should you even exist?
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:52.460]   Do your customers want your product or whatever?
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:54.220]   And then something will happen where you're like,
[01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:56.180]   wow, we really nailed that, that's really great.
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.500]   Or, you know, got a product released
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:00.380]   or got some good kudos from something.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:03.500]   All right, everyone, we're gonna go celebrate.
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:04.940]   And actually, everyone's still like,
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.460]   no, no, we've got all these other problems.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.860]   Nope, we're gonna go celebrate,
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:11.500]   and then we'll go back to the problems.
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:12.420]   But if you don't do that,
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.900]   then it starts building on this kind of,
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.180]   you never really get to celebrate.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.460]   - And be grateful.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:22.500]   Well, I think this is a good time to go celebrate
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.380]   the very fact that we're alive today.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.380]   We get to live and enjoy this incredible life
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.780]   the two of us, and have this great conversation.
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:32.140]   And we'll get to celebrate over some scrambled eggs.
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:32.980]   - Beautiful.
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:33.800]   - I'm gonna hold you to it.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.640]   - Beautiful.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.100]   - Kimball, thank you so much for talking today.
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:37.860]   - Thank you for having me.
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.300]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.460]   with Kimball Musk.

[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:47.980]   from Anthony Bourdain.
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:50.920]   "Your body is not a temple.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:53.820]   "It's an amusement park.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.220]   "Enjoy the ride."
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.340]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:01.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:04.500]   (upbeat music)
