[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580]   Is it wise for a girlfriend and a boyfriend to travel together?
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.400]   To stay in the same hotel?
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   Should they?
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.440]   It's a question we regularly get, and this time it's from a young woman.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.840]   "Hello Pastor John, my boyfriend and I plan to leave in three weeks for a trip we scheduled
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.320]   five months ago.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.880]   My mother said she fears for us and for the temptations that could arise during the trip.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.840]   I have assured her that while we have fallen into temptation in the past, we have desperately
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.140]   sought God and other Christians' counsel to confront that pattern, and we truly have
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.440]   laid it at the foot of the cross.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.800]   After discussing this respectfully and in full, we concluded that all would be fine.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.000]   Today my mother again confronted me and tells me that she believes we are dishonoring God
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.440]   even though we will be staying in separate rooms the entire week.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.160]   While I am frustrated, I also do not want to dishonor my parents' wishes.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.000]   I am troubled and wondering if we are dishonoring God by traveling together before marriage."
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.440]   Well, you know, I've thought about this question and I've got ideas that I'm going to give
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.160]   in just a minute, but just listening to you, Tony, read the question again, I kind of get
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   my back up about this guy.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560]   Yeah, sure.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   Absolutely.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.040]   I mean, ask what to say to the young woman, I'll say it, but as you read it, I just want
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.880]   to say, "Guy, come on, come on, show your respect for this mom, save this trip."
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.880]   Okay, that's enough of that.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   Let me get to my answer.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880]   That's good.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.880]   That's important.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.600]   Let me give you three reasons from the Bible why I think the ethical instincts of your
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.160]   mother are right.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.760]   I think it's unwise for an unmarried couple to take a trip like this together.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.320]   And not only unwise, but contrary to three biblical guidelines.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.680]   But first, let me suggest why I think this is even an issue between you and your mother.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.440]   Probably 50 years ago, when I was 20, taking a three-week trip as an unmarried couple would
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040]   have been more unthinkable than it is today.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280]   Now, why is that?
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.880]   For two reasons, at least.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:31.720]   One is that sex outside marriage is considered normal today by the world, and so avoiding
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.540]   situations where it might more easily happen is pointless in the wider culture.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.200]   So there's less cultural support for the conviction that such trips are unwise.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.840]   That's the first reason it's even an issue.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.400]   Cultural change like that.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.760]   Not a healthy change.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.960]   The other reason is that for 50 years there has been a growing pressure culturally to
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.140]   treat men and women as though they were the same, which means that it should be just as
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.280]   legitimate to take a trip with a young woman as it is with a young man.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   Otherwise it's unjust.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.520]   Now, I regard both of these cultural transformations as tragic and leading toward much sin and
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.320]   much sorrow, hurt, damage in all kinds of ways and relations.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:38.580]   It requires a strong confidence and courage for a young person to swim against such cultural
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.920]   tides.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.880]   And I hope that you will be that kind of strong, confident, courageous person, and I hope this
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.440]   boyfriend will be as well.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.720]   So that's the setting.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.960]   That's the setting that I think creates the present conflict.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.240]   Now, here are the three biblical teachings that I think should cause you not to take
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.200]   that trip and save it for when you're married.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.160]   Number one, God has created the human body and mind in such a way that those who are
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.320]   in love desire very strongly to touch each other and move toward sexual climax together.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.720]   That's normal.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.560]   It's inevitable that that desire would happen.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:34.240]   And God has made provision for the joy of that relationship, that satisfaction in marriage
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.840]   and nowhere else.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.000]   You have already discovered, you said so, that extended time together, especially in
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.680]   private, makes those desires very strong.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.440]   They've led you already into sexual activity you regret.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.080]   If you love to please the Lord in purity of mind and body, here's the guidance that God
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.580]   gives from Romans 13, 14.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:05.020]   Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.440]   That term, "make no provision," means don't put yourself in an unnecessary position
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   that will likely stir up desires that you cannot control.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.640]   If you say, "Well, we can control them," I would remind you of two things.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.560]   One, God warns us that desires are deceitful, Ephesians 4, 22.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.480]   They're deceitful.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.000]   And sin is deceitful, Hebrews 3, 13.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.120]   This means that the desires of the body have a huge power over the mind and the will to
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.880]   make you think and will foolishly.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.360]   That's their power.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.580]   And some temptations, therefore, are to be avoided, not just resisted.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.600]   God could indeed catch Jesus if he jumped off the temple.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   He could.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   Easy, easy, easy.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.880]   God can do that.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.960]   Just like he could keep you from fornication.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   But Jesus said to Satan, "I'm not going to jump," period.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.400]   And his reason was what yours should be.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.480]   You shall not put the Lord your God to the test, Luke 4, 12.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.720]   God could, if he willed, keep you pure on such a trip, but his warnings are such that
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.160]   you should say, "I'm not going to put the Lord to the test on this one."
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.420]   That's number one.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:45.200]   Number two, here's the second biblical teaching that should cause you to save this trip for
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.000]   when you're married.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.680]   Most of the people in the world, both religious and irreligious, assume that if you are traveling
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.280]   together, you will sleep together.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.200]   Most who see you will not even know you have separate rooms, and the others will think
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.680]   that separate rooms are not going to keep you from sleeping together.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.500]   After all, for most young people today, sex before marriage is normal.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.400]   They would see you as just fitting in.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.080]   That's what they would assume.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.640]   So to the biblically formed people, they will assume you're careless, if not sinning, and
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.920]   to the non-biblical people, the ones you should care about a lot, will assume you are having
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   sex.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   That's what they're going to assume.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.360]   There's no other way they can think about you as they watch you.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.600]   But here's what God says about these kinds of observations from the world.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.800]   He says, "Walk properly."
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:49.600]   It's a very interesting word, "Euskemonos," uprightly, properly, fittingly, suitably.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.320]   Walk properly before outsiders, 1 Thessalonians 4.12.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.880]   Or give thought to what is honorable in the sight of all, Romans 12.17.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.280]   Or we aim at what is honorable, not only in the Lord's sight, but also in the sight of
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.040]   man, 2 Corinthians 8.21.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:18.360]   So if you love Christ more than the fun of such a trip, and you want your lives to speak
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:26.080]   clearly about his standards of purity, I don't think you will prioritize this trip over your
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.520]   commitment to communicate clearly the beauty of Christ's standards of purity.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.000]   And that trip does not communicate that.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:44.440]   Number three, by taking this trip or not taking it, you weaken or strengthen the standards
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   of other Christians, especially younger ones, who may be even weaker than you are and are
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.840]   looking for more justification to do what you're about to do.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.560]   Paul says, "If food makes my brother stumble, I'll never eat meat, lest I make my brother
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   stumble."
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:11.280]   Now, how much more would he avoid a three-week trip that will further normalize a practice
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.440]   that most people will simply not be able to carry out with sexual purity?
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.840]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:25.340]   How much more would Paul say, "I'm not going to take a three-week trip that will further
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.840]   normalize a practice that most people will simply not be able to carry out with sexual
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.280]   purity"?
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.640]   Do you have a right to take this trip in your Christian freedom?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   Probably.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.240]   That's just not the issue, Paul would say.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.520]   Paul said, "We put no obstacle in anyone's way so that no fault may be found with our
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.720]   ministry," 2 Corinthians 6:3.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.360]   For Paul, this meant not doing things that he had every right to do.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.560]   The issue is not rights.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.360]   The issue is love and purity and whether you will participate in a cultural pattern that
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.720]   is destructive in the long run.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:18.120]   So because of those three biblical teachings, I think your mother's moral instincts about
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.880]   this trip are right, and I would encourage you, save the joy of that kind of extended
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.760]   togetherness for marriage.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.440]   You won't regret it.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   Solid wisdom.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.120]   These are the questions we really appreciate.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.480]   You know, tricky life situation that calls for biblical thought to process carefully.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.600]   And if you're in such a situation, send us your question by going to our online home,
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.520]   it's desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn, and click on the box that says "Submit a question."
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.240]   We do our best to address the principles of those situations while asking you to also
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   lean on the Christian friends and parents and pastors God has put around you.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.080]   We are no replacement for those people.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   We seek to supplement them with some considerations from Scripture.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.480]   Well, in the last third of the book of Proverbs, the theme of the quarrelsome wife is brought
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:15.780]   up five times in Proverbs 19, 13, 21, 9, 21, 19, 25, 24, and 27, 15.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.160]   And those references lead some to conclude that a husband is encouraged to separate from
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   such a wife.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   But is he?
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.360]   That's the question up next on Friday.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.960]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.520]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.520]   [END]
