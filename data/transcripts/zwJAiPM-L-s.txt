[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Marriage is complex, far more complex than we typically expect going in, as
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.480]   Matt and Lauren Chandler explained a short while back to us. I asked them what
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.780]   it looks like in their home as they live out God's design for marriage in today's
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.040]   world. Here's what they shared. We understood complementarianism biblically,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.520]   but I'm coming from a background where there was a lot of abuse in my home
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.440]   growing up. Lauren's coming from a background where there was a lot of kind
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   of, correct me if I'm wrong here, a lot of kind of external religion but not a lot
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.120]   of heart transformation. And so the baggage I brought into the marriage and
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.640]   the baggage she brought into the marriage, although in essence we understood that we
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.560]   embraced complementarian views of the scriptures and of life, I think Lauren had
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.600]   to learn to trust me and I had to learn to try to nurture and nourish Lauren's
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.280]   gifts and abilities. And so I think early on in the marriage it was a tougher run
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600]   for us than maybe where we are now where we've learned one another and as we've
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.800]   navigated the waters of, I mean, 15 years together, 17 years together,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880]   15 years married, that really pragmatically how it looks now is a real
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.200]   seriousness about me creating the space for Lauren to pursue and become the things
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.640]   that God has put on her plate and in her heart to do that are inside our home and
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.160]   outside of our home. And then simultaneously, I mean, I know she's
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.920]   sitting right here next to me, to say anything I hadn't said to her before,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.520]   but I just feel like the most encouraged, blessed man ever. And that's not because
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.920]   she's a yes man. I mean, she'll really...she'll go, "Well, I don't know that it
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.120]   was exactly happened that way." I mean, she'll really hold me accountable and
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.000]   encourage and go after my heart in ways that I don't even know what's going on in
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.480]   my heart. The Lord's gifted her to really dig around in there and really be my
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.680]   helpmate in every way, as the pastor of the church, as a preacher, as a leader,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.480]   as a father. In every way, Lauren's love for me, respect for me,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   and encouragement of me has made me, I think, the things that God wanted me to be
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.520]   and needed Lauren, wanted to use Lauren to bring those things about in my life.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.960]   - I would say the first, you know, six years of marriage were hard and I think
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.360]   I needed to learn...I was great at the submitting part, and partly because Matt
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.600]   is a great leader, and it's really freeing to submit to someone that you trust their
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.520]   leadership. But I think for me, I was squashed not by him, but by a lot of fear.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.720]   And so there are times I wasn't his helper because I wouldn't say anything.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.200]   There was just this kind of self-contempt. And so instead of walking in freedom in
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   Jesus and really knowing who he had made me and really knowing who he was and what he
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.560]   made marriage to be, I was just squashed. But once I got to kind of have my feet
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.360]   planted in the gospel and really understanding the gospel, the Lord has
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.400]   given me as a helper. And instead of just being silent and just feeling like,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.800]   "Well, I just have to deal with my stuff," the Lord gave me courage to love him well
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   by saying some things that weren't disrespectful, but I was at least bringing
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.240]   some things up that before I just was like, "Well, it's not worth it.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.960]   I'm not going to do that," which was self-centered. I just wanted to avoid
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.280]   conflict and I wanted what was easy and it felt easier to say nothing.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.120]   So I think that's how we've grown in our marriage, which I think sometimes is
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.040]   different for a lot of women. Most women feel like they're just really
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.240]   struggling to kind of reign some things in where I kind of needed to...
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.760]   I need to get outside of myself and I needed to see that I wasn't being a good
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.240]   helper to him by avoiding the pain of loving him well.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   - Yeah. That's a good way to put it.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   - Yeah.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.840]   - That was Matt and Lauren Chandler. We are grateful for them and for their
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.080]   willingness to let us see inside the struggles of their own marriage.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.040]   And on a related note, I recently talked with Matt about dating and the challenges
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.560]   of singleness. You can find our conversation in an article titled,
