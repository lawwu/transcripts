[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.360]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. On today's show, we're going to
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.040]   talk about the freedom of ratios, or the freedom of percentages, if you prefer.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.160]   Let me give you a quick introductory comment so that you understand where this show is coming
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.360]   from. Over the past few shows, I've developed a few ideas. I've talked about the importance of
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.520]   living rich, focusing on living that rich life now, and not focusing excessively on frugality
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.160]   or extreme savings unless that's something that's getting you where you want to go.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.160]   I talked about my personal experience of how, once I understood the concept of extreme savings,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.040]   it brought me to a place of wanting to save as much of my income as possible so that I could
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.680]   be financially independent. But then over time, realizing that I don't actually need to be
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.400]   financially independent to live the life of my dreams. It's not necessary. And so for me,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.200]   extreme savings is a valuable tool to know that it exists, but it's not the way that I want to
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520]   live my life right now because I'm not trying to escape from anything. I wouldn't quit working. I
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.560]   wouldn't retire. And so why not? Why should I not focus on living a richer life and on spending
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.920]   money on things that matter to me? Now, after developing that concept, I quickly followed it up
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.480]   with the seeming opposite concept, the freedom that comes with frugality. I talked about how
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.200]   saving money and frugality is important because it brings you a level of freedom,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.720]   and it brings you a level of control over your life. And so you've got to find the right balance
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.560]   between these two things, between the freedom of frugality and also living a rich life now,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.600]   and the enjoyment that comes with consumption. So how do you find that appropriate balance?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.440]   How do you balance these things in a correct way? Well, sometimes this is easy, and it's obvious
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.480]   that you should not have a sense of balance. For example, let's say that you are, you know,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.360]   a man or a woman who has decided, "I don't want to work at this job anymore. I want to leave this
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.680]   job." And you calculate that you want to leave this job and you want to move across the country
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   or move around the world, and you calculate that you need a $5,000 budget to do that.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.640]   Well, in my opinion, there's no need for balance or, you know, trying to handle mutually opposing
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.680]   things of that situation. If you've decided, "I want to leave this job, and I want to move
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.880]   across the country, around the world, and get a better job," then your goal is as quickly as
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.480]   possible to save $5,000. You do it now. And you live on beans and rice and stop spending any money
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   because this is a goal that can be achieved quickly. Now, you could expand that if you are
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.760]   convinced that extreme savings is an appropriate path for you, and you just want to stop working as
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   quickly as possible so you can be financially independent. Then you might buckle down and
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.400]   live on nothing and execute that plan as quickly as possible. There are many people who have
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.720]   clearly defined goals. And when you have a clearly defined goal, especially a short or
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.040]   medium-term goal, it makes sense to move towards it in an extreme way. That might be to start your
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   own business. When I started Radical Personal Finance, I put my household on an extreme
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.120]   financial diet, on an extreme budget. Why? Well, because by lowering my expenses to nothing,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.040]   I had the freedom to start a business that I thought would give me a really good lifestyle.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.880]   If I had just simply tried to continue consuming and consuming and consuming,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.400]   it might have taken me a longer period of time to generate the amount of money that I
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.000]   needed in order to go full-time on Radical Personal Finance. And so it's wise in those
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.360]   situations to put yourself into an austere budget so that you can quickly achieve your goal.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.240]   Or perhaps you have some kind of event or adventure that is very clearly laid out. For example,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.840]   I've over the years read many stories about travelers who decided they wanted to go and
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.880]   travel. Maybe I've read stories about people who decided, "You know what? We're going to drive the
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.280]   Pan-American Highway. We're going to drive from Alaska to Argentina." And so they calculate the
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.760]   budget that they need. They figure we need a suitable vehicle, plus we need, say, $75,000
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.280]   of budget over the course of two years. And we're going to plan to spend $60,000 total over the
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.200]   course of two years on our traveling expenses. Then we need a $15,000 emergency fund and/or
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   resettlement fund. So their target is very simple. We're going to save $75,000 and have a paid-for
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.560]   vehicle. Then we're going to drive from Argentina to Alaska. Well, that's a very simple thing.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   What do you do when you have a goal like that in a specific short-term timeline? Well,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.720]   you focus on it. And it's very gratifying to put yourself on an austere budget, beans and rice,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.680]   and spend no money, and house-sit for people so you can spend nothing, and you live a super
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.960]   minimalistic lifestyle. You work all the time because you can quickly accomplish that goal.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.360]   And in one year, perhaps, of spending very little and saving everything, you can purchase your
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.440]   vehicle and have enough money to leave and go travel for two years, or purchase your sailboat
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.720]   and have enough money to start off on your trip across the world. So in those situations,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.520]   an extreme plan where it's all in, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.560]   But those kinds of plans don't make a lot of sense to those of us who've already set up a
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   lifestyle that we're somewhat comfortable with. Maybe you don't dream of driving from Alaska to
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.200]   Argentina, or at least not this year. Maybe you don't dream of sailing the world. Maybe you don't
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.840]   dream of retiring early. But that doesn't mean you don't want to live well, and it doesn't mean
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.600]   you don't want to become wealthier. So what's the solution? What do you do? My answer is,
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.120]   you impose upon yourself ratios that make sense. You choose percentages,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.080]   and you use those rules of percentages to help you to handle your money.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.120]   You get to choose the percentages, and I'm going to give you a number of ideas.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.520]   But what I find helpful about ratios or percentages is simply that they help me
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.800]   to balance my emotionalism, and they help me to think about where I want to go and how I'm
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.200]   going to get there, and then to impose a logical path onto myself so that I know I'll get where
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:49.040]   I want to go in the fullness of time. You can apply these ratios to your own life when it
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.520]   comes to how much money you save, how much money you spend, how much money you give,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.840]   and they're all useful. I'm going to give you a large number of examples here of ratios that I
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.680]   think are worth your consideration. Let's start with how much money you save.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.760]   One of the simplest things that you can do in the beginning is simply choose a percentage of
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.400]   your income that you're going to save and choose a percentage of your income that you're going to
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:25.040]   spend. You can choose these ratios depending on how aggressive your goals are. For an average
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.600]   person, a normal household, a normal household that chose intentionally to set aside 10% of
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.160]   their income up front to pay themselves first 10% of their income, that normal household
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.200]   can be massively improved by that simple decision.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.360]   Pay yourself first is a tricky concept, but there's no question in my mind that it's an effective
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.400]   tool. You decide, "I'm going to save first X percentage of my income," and traditional advice,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.600]   right, going back for a very long period of time is something like 10%. If you will save and invest
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.360]   10% of your income, you can become financially independent over the course of a reasonable time
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.480]   period during your lifetime. So let's start with that. Let's say that you decide, "I'm going to
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:23.280]   save 10% of my income." You should also consider how much of your income you want to give to others.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.160]   Having a giving budget, a specific budget that is allocated in advance that's done based upon
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   percentages can give you a great deal of personal freedom because now you've chosen how much of your
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.240]   money you're going to give to others. Let's say that you choose to give 10% of your income.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.520]   Well, if you set that up in advance, and what I recommend, you set up a separate account,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.440]   just like you would have a separate savings account for your financial freedom fund, and
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.640]   you set up a separate account for your giving account, and then just simply put 10% of your
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.280]   income into that, now you have a budget. You know how much money you can afford to give away.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.480]   You've already decided it in advance. And this can help you to do two things. It can help you
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.920]   to have enough money to give to people when you want to give to them, but it can also help you to
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.880]   know when to say no when you run out of money so that when your heart is being pulled in a certain
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.360]   direction and you feel like you want to give more money, but you look and realize, "I should not
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.040]   right now give more money," you know you've got a budget. But you've chosen that budget based upon a
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:34.720]   ratio. There's an incredible freedom in that. You can choose a more aggressive ratio. You could say,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.680]   "I want to save 20% of my income. I want to save 20% of my income, give 10% of my income, and spend
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.040]   70% of my income." This is a great financial plan. Anybody who continually over the course of their
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.720]   lifetime saves 20% of their income every year gains an incredible amount of financial freedom.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.200]   And as their assets grow and they start to experience the joyful part of the compound
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.360]   interest curve, it just grows and grows and grows and grows. And that's a very reasonable
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.520]   number for you to set. I don't think there's anybody that would look at you and say, "If you're
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.040]   spending 70% of your income, saving 20 and giving 10," there's nobody that would look at you and
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.160]   say that you're being irresponsible in any part of your life. That's a very balanced way to approach
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.680]   your income. You're saving quite a lot of money. You're giving a healthy amount of money,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:33.040]   and yet you still have the significant majority of your income to spend. That's profoundly
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.360]   helpful. Or you might choose a more aggressive path. Let's say that you live on the "spend half,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:47.280]   save half" mantra. I think that's a reasonable number. You might say, and then you can figure
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.040]   out how you put in your giving budget in there, maybe you say, "I'm going to give away 10% of
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.600]   my income. I'm going to save 40% of my income, and I'm going to spend 50% of my income."
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.880]   That's a reasonable thing to do. That's a reasonable way to decide it. Whatever the
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.960]   percentages or the ratio is that you choose, once you've chosen it, you now have a sense of freedom
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.040]   because you've analyzed your situation, you've decided, "This is my goal," and now you can play
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.680]   with the other factors. For me, this is, I think, one of the most important things
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.720]   that I didn't understand earlier in my life. I didn't understand that by choosing a fixed
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   percentage, it would bring me the freedom to say, "Now, when I want to increase it,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.600]   I don't have any conflict." Let's keep it simple. Let's say that you want to save 50% of your
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.640]   income and you want to spend 50% of your income. Well, if you've chosen that and you want to spend
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.280]   more money, you know that you've chosen the rule for yourself is that you're going to save half,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   spend half, so now you go to the income side, which is where the freedom comes in.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.160]   You figure out, "Well, if I want to double my expenses, but I also want to be rich,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.480]   all I need to do is double my income. If I can double my income, I can double my spending and
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.720]   double my saving," and that's where you should focus. It's usually the most productive thing.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.240]   That's why I have this course on how to increase your income with a job and a career that you love.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.640]   I think it's the most powerful, most important thing. A good financial advisor
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.560]   should first and foremost be a career coach, an income coach,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.320]   because that's the single most important driver of how wealthy you become.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:38.080]   A good financial advisor should not be someone who sits around and optimizes $1,000 by figuring out
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.640]   to put your bonds in this account to minimize the taxation on the ordinary income and put your
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:49.040]   capital gains assets over here. These things are piddly stuff, piddly. A good financial advisor
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.520]   should start by saying, "How are we going to double your income in the next three years?"
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.160]   Because if we can double your income in the next three years, everything in your financial plan
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.440]   can change, and you can live a bigger, better lifestyle with more consumption. You can give
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.720]   more money away with more joy, and you can save a whole lot more money and get richer all the
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.760]   way across the board. When you realize that when I choose my percentage and stick to it,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.240]   I can do both. I'm not stuck into either spending more or saving more. I can do both,
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.720]   because I have a ratio, and the ratio gives me freedom.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:37.120]   I encourage you, as a first part of your plan, to think about what percentage of your income
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.080]   it's right for you to spend and what percentage it's right for you to save.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.680]   Choose that in the most advised, thoughtful way that you're capable of, and then commit to it,
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.240]   and then put in place the appropriate structure, maybe automatic transfers,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.600]   maybe splitting your income into multiple accounts, assigning your direct deposit to
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.680]   multiple accounts, or whatever way you handle your finances, so that you can make sure that
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.760]   that takes place over time. I think these are some ratios that are worthy of your consideration,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:17.840]   a 10/10/80, a 10/20/70, or maybe a 10/40/50. These are some good ratios for you to consider.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:25.680]   I think if you get to beyond 50% of your income, you want to make sure that you really have very
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.600]   compelling goals for fast financial independence, and you know why you're pursuing such an aggressive
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:39.280]   plan, or you make sure that you have a very high income. I think that if you go beyond 50% savings,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.920]   you better be clear as to why you're doing that. It's fine if you do, it's your money,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.400]   you handle it any way that you want, but I think you want to be clear on exactly why you're doing
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:57.280]   that, because I fear that in this audience, there are more of us who are saving excessively,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:04.560]   and would be really served by spending more, giving more, rather than just by hoarding more.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.080]   Now, I want to give you another idea of how to get to it. Let's say that you're currently saving
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:19.760]   nothing. Nothing. Well, here again, ratios are your friend. What do you do? Well, start to stick
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.640]   a wedge in your income. If I come along and I'm dealing with somebody who's spending everything,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:31.680]   we start with a goal of, say, getting to 10% of their income of savings. But I think the wedge
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.000]   principle is extremely valuable. This month, let's not save 10% of your income. This month,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.560]   let's save 1% of your income. So if you're making $10,000 per month, well, take $10,000,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.760]   1% of that is $100. So this month, let's save $100. And then let's make a plan to increase it
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:01.440]   by 1% every month for the next 10 months until we get to 10%. That's a really useful rule.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.040]   This is the kind of rule that, in a normal situation, gives somebody the confidence that
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.080]   I can do it. I can just increase my savings by 1% every month until I get to my target goal of 10%.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   Very useful. Utilize that wedge principle. It's a rule that you impose upon yourself that has a
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:34.080]   really strong success chance. Another rule that I consider very useful if you want to increase
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.800]   your income – excuse me, if you want to increase your savings. If you're somebody who's prone to
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   spending too much or you're working with someone who's prone to spending too much, one of mine is
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:50.960]   when you make more money, save half, spend half. Let's say your current income is $100,000 a year.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:58.720]   Well, when you increase your income, maybe this year you get a 3% cost of living raise or a 5%
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:05.200]   bonus. Just simply commit to saving half and spending half. And then these ratios start to
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.640]   give you freedom. It's not all consumption. It's not, "Hey, we got a $5,000 bonus. Let's all go
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.240]   to Disney World." But it's not all savings. For some people, savings are fun because they
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.480]   understand why they're saving. But for many people, savings is viewed as a form of torture.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.760]   They want to consume because consumption is fun. Well, the ratio gives you freedom. You can do
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.920]   both. Just save half, spend half. Whenever you make more money, save half, spend half.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.320]   And if you do that, over a course of a period of years, those ratios will help somebody to get
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:43.280]   very quickly into a very strong financial position. Where else can you use ratios to
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.760]   inform your decisions? Let's stick with these spending habits for a moment before we get to
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.640]   investments. Ratios can help you to make an intelligent decision on some of your consumption
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.760]   items. For example, how much of your money should you spend on housing? Well, if you go to the
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.880]   internet and you pull up DuckDuckGo and ask it how much money you should spend on housing,
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.760]   you'll quickly find some answers. You'll find answers like 35% of your income should be spent
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.440]   on housing. 45% of your income should be spent on housing. These are not bad places to start.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.520]   45% is too high. But the point is, these are not bad places to start. These ratios
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:33.440]   basically show what is, and they're important to inform you. If somebody comes along to me
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.920]   and says that they're going to spend 60% of their income on housing expenses, I know that's too much
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:46.400]   house because the other parts of life are also important. All of us have other expenses, and
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.520]   you don't want to be so house poor. That's why a lending company has a ratio. That's why if you go
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.880]   and you want to rent, you'll have a landlord that'll say you have to have three times the rent
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.440]   in terms of your monthly income because they know that if you only have two times the rent in your
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.840]   monthly income, you're not going to be able to pay the rent in the fullness of time. So those
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.800]   are a good place to start. What I think is more important though is to understand where those
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.680]   things start and then ask yourself, if I do this, will it get me where I want to go? If I spend 35%
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.360]   of my income on housing, will that get me where I want to go? When you care about wealth building,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.040]   those ratios are probably not appropriate for you. You might need to spend 35% of your income on
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:37.680]   housing, but if you're spending 35% of your income on rent, it's probably going to be very difficult
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.240]   for you to save 50% of your income so that you can start your business, which is going to make
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:48.080]   you a multimillionaire. And so you want to choose your own ratios, choose your own decisions.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:55.440]   With regard to renting, there's not really a right or a wrong number. Lower is generally better,
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.760]   but you need to rent an appropriate lifestyle. Here I would ask you, what are your opportunities?
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:07.280]   I have consulted with people who were building a fast growing company, something like a tech
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.960]   specifically. I'm thinking of one guy who was building a tech company. When I came along,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.600]   he was spending all of his money on personal living expenses, and yet he had this fast
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.640]   growing tech company that had tremendous opportunity. When I came along, he was worried
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.160]   about credit card debt. My answer to him was, I said, "Don't worry about the credit card debt.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.600]   Pay the minimum payments. Pay what you need to pay in order to keep your household going.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:36.720]   Your financial engine here is this fast growing company, and there's very good evidence that this
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:43.680]   should be a very productive investment for you." Lo and behold, came true. Five years later,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.440]   he exited the company, multimillion dollar exit, and he was able to pay off all his debt. He was
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.840]   able to become wealthy seemingly overnight, but it was actually that period of time of fighting
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.680]   through where he didn't have any money, was living on credit cards for a significant period of time.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.120]   So you want to look and see what kind of opportunities do I have. But by having a
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.000]   personal rule, especially a personal rule that's oriented towards wealth,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.160]   you'll make better decisions. So let me give you a couple of ideas regarding housing and vehicles.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:24.480]   One of the major differences between people who are wealthy and people who are ordinary not wealthy,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.960]   especially in a country like the United States of America, has to do with what percentage of
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.720]   your income and/or what percentage of your wealth is invested in your personal home.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.520]   Wealthy people in the United States of America, and I think around the world,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.840]   but wealthy people tend to have a very small percentage of their net worth invested in their
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:49.440]   home. The home may be very, very nice. You might live in a $20 million home,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.160]   but there's a very good chance that the majority of people who live in a $20 million home
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.640]   have a $200 million net worth. And so one of my goals is that I never want more than 10%
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:12.320]   of my wealth tied up in my personal home. That doesn't necessarily mean you can't live in a nice
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:18.000]   home. It does mean that if I'm going to live in a nice home, I'm going to make sure that nice home
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.800]   is mortgaged and I don't have all of my net worth in that home. I think it's a major mistake for
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:32.240]   somebody with $150,000 saved to go and pay cash for a $150,000 home. Why? Well, first of all,
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.840]   the home is a consumption item. I don't mind it being classified on the balance sheet as an asset,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:43.120]   but I think the classic Robert Kiyosaki, "A home is not an asset because it uses money," that's
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.680]   true. If you care about building wealth, you should think of your home more as a liability
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.080]   than as an asset, because even if it is an asset, it's a very unproductive asset.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.640]   It's something that you consume. That's just what it is. It's a consumption item. It's not
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.120]   something that's productive. And so by qualifying it as unproductive, you want to minimize the
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.760]   amount of money that you spend on unproductive things and maximize the amount of money that
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.800]   you spend on productive things. And so if I'm talking to somebody who has $150,000 saved and
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.440]   they're thinking about buying a house, especially in the North American context where mortgage money
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:24.080]   flows down like rain, I would encourage them, never put more than, say, 10% of your net worth
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.480]   into that house. Put down the small down payment and keep your wealth, keep your money invested as
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.000]   something that's going to go higher. Now, this would change if we moved into another culture
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.840]   where mortgage financing wasn't quite so free and available, but not change all that much,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:47.200]   because the same lesson still stands. I would rather rent in one of those places and keep my
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.440]   money invested in something that's going to be productive rather than in a personal consumption.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.080]   And so I think that you should set a goal that in terms of my housing, I don't want more than 10%,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:05.200]   maybe to a max of, say, 20% of my money invested in my house. Beyond that, it's too much. It's too
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.320]   much risk. It's too much concentration. And it's not putting you on the path towards wealth. It's
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:16.160]   keeping you in the path of having a nice fancy house, which raises other areas of your expenses,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.480]   but it's not putting you in a direction towards wealth. If I lived in a house and I looked down
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.400]   at my budgets, my balance sheet, and I realized that 70% of my net worth is in the house,
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:32.240]   I would change that. And I'd recommend that you change that. And again, a target, say 10% to 20%
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.240]   of your net worth in the house. Now, can you do that and still live in a nice house? Yes.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.200]   If your income is high enough, and if the financing is available to you,
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.120]   if I lived in a house where mortgage financing was not cheap, sorry, excuse me, in a nation where
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.760]   mortgage financing was not cheap and not available, and I woke up and lived in a million dollar house
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   and that was the only asset that I had, I would first analyze my business and say,
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.000]   "Does my business have the opportunity to grow massively?" If there is, maybe I would keep the
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.400]   house. But if the business is not a hyper, hyper fast growing business, I think you're better off,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.200]   sell the house, get something more modest and redeploy those assets into money, into assets
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:21.120]   that are going to make you money. Now, if you're in a mortgage environment, then refinance the
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:27.760]   house. Minimize the amount of money that's exposed to the personal housing expenses. And if the
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.960]   ratios still work, where a modest percentage of your income is used to pay the mortgage payment,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.440]   take that money and invest it in something that's more productive. I think it's one of the biggest
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.040]   mistakes that low income and middle income people make often in Western countries, is too much money
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:49.680]   spent on housing. What else? Well, this is less important at the middle income ranges, but it's
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.960]   more important at the low income ranges. What percentage of your income is, or net worth,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:01.360]   is being spent on vehicles? As with anything, some care is needed here. I believe there are
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.760]   good times and good reasons why it makes sense to have expensive vehicles. I don't personally
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:13.200]   subscribe to the theory across the board that one should always drive the cheapest jalopy that they
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.160]   can find. I think that's a real mistake. I think this is something that has hurt me in my own
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.960]   personal life, that there are times because I was always committed to driving the most frugal car
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.480]   that I could find and the most intelligent kind of thoughtful decision. I believe it hurt me. It
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.200]   hurt my income generating abilities. And there've been times in my life where I should have had a
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:40.880]   nicer car. However, the fact still remains that unless the car is making you money in a fairly
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.680]   direct manner, it's probably one of your fastest appreciating things that you own, your fastest
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.440]   appreciating assets. So you want to minimize the amount of your net worth that is exposed to that
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.160]   if you care about being wealthy. The ratios that I like, for the hardcore of us, I think that you
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:07.280]   should spend 10% of your income on a car. Total, meaning that you take your income, take 10% of it,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:13.920]   and that's the total value of the car. So let's try this on for size. Let's say that you make $100,000
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.120]   a year. I think you should spend about 10% of your income total on a car, about $10,000,
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.000]   if you care about wealth. Now, could that be higher? Yes. I think you could go up as high as
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.200]   50%. I think you'd go up to 50% of your income being used and still build wealth over time.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.040]   But it should be across the border. It should be across all of your household's vehicles.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:42.720]   If your household income is $10,000 and you have two cars worth $15,000 each and you have a $15,000
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:49.840]   boat and $5,000 of ATVs, okay, I think you can still build enough wealth. But it's slower than
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.480]   if you're at 10%. So I like the 10% number and I think that should be where we start.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:04.800]   What a difference this makes when we tell people a ratio to start with. Think about your 16-year-old
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.480]   son or your 16-year-old daughter. If you train them, as I will mine, that if you're going to
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.960]   have a vehicle at all, which who knows, increasingly there are good reasons not to
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.160]   have a vehicle. We'll see what the world looks like 10 years from now. But if you're going to
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   have a private vehicle at all, that it should be worth no more than 10% of your annual income.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:38.560]   You set them on the path for wealth in a profound way. If your child is making $30,000 per year,
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.760]   I think they should be driving a good quality, safe $3,000 car. And they're going to be,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.080]   have so much money available to invest that they can get wealthy very quickly.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:58.320]   Maybe you double it up. Maybe 10% is too much for you. 20%? Great. You can get to a $6,000 car.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:07.120]   But you're not going to get to a $30,000 car, at least not if they care about wealth. And thus,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.400]   you can help them to avoid one of the most expensive mistakes that we often make when
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:19.200]   we're young. So think about what percentage of income. Net worth-wise, let's say that you
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.560]   have a significant net worth. Well, here, I think you need to choose a percentage. And think about
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.840]   that percentage and how that makes sense in your overall scenario. Maybe you say, "I'm not going
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:37.040]   to have more than 5% of my net worth that's used up and spent on vehicles." And you're going to
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.400]   have less than 5% of your net worth. So put some numbers to these things and see what feels right.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.640]   Let's say someone has a million dollar net worth. Is it fine for someone with a million dollar net
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.400]   worth to have $50,000 worth of vehicles, boats, RVs, etc.? I think that's fine. Is it fine for
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.920]   them to have $100,000? Of course, it's their money. They can do what they like. Maybe that's okay.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.440]   But what it's often going to start to do is it's going to start to put them on the path
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:10.160]   of wanting to become wealthy. And so if you want to become wealthy, you want to make sure that you
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.760]   have assets that are going up in value. Now, these percentages, I think, will change over time.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:23.120]   Let me give you an example. Let's say that you have a person who is earning $100,000 a year
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:31.360]   from a job and has no savings. Well, in that situation, I'd like them to drive a $10,000 car
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.320]   and save and invest money. But that person is in a very different situation than somebody who's
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:47.120]   generating $100,000 of income from their portfolio of investments, and those investments are increasing
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:56.480]   in value every year by 10% per year. Well, now the person with $100,000 of portfolio income,
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.840]   next year is expected to be $110,000, and the next year expected to be $125,000, et cetera.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.920]   They can now spend more money on their stuff, their consumption items,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:14.320]   while still becoming wealthier. So I'm trying to give you ratios that I think make a lot of sense,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.480]   but you should also analyze these ratios in the context of where you are in life.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.840]   Now, we've talked a lot about spending. We've talked about income. Let's talk about investments.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:32.000]   Ratios will give you freedom with regard to your investments. Let me ask you a question.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.360]   How much money from your investment portfolio should be invested into safe assets,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:49.520]   conservative assets? How much money from your investment portfolio should be invested in
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:58.640]   speculative assets? How much money in your investment portfolio should be exposed to any
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:06.080]   one particular investment? How much money in your investment portfolio should be invested
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:12.480]   in a certain asset class? Now, I don't know these numbers for you. I'm going to give you
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.840]   some ideas here. I don't know these numbers for you. What I do know is that you should come up
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.760]   with a number that works for you. And if you're trying to figure out and you're trying to analyze
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.840]   your finances, you should try to figure out a number that makes sense to you. And I'm going
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.720]   to give you some ideas on how to get there. As with all of the previous ratios, there's really
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   no science to any of these numbers. We can run some math, but there are exceptions to all of them.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.000]   But there are some ways that we can think it through in a somewhat disciplined way,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.680]   a scientific way, and then I think get in the right range, the right ballpark.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.920]   Let's talk for a moment about, let's start with speculative assets rather than safe assets or
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.760]   conservative assets. What percentage of your portfolio should be invested into speculative
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:07.520]   assets? Well, I think it should be enough of a percentage where a big win would be meaningful,
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.080]   but not so much of a percentage that a big loss would wipe you out.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.360]   So let's play with some numbers. Let's assume that you have an investment portfolio of $1 million.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:27.200]   And for the sake of analysis, let's say you're earning $100,000 per year, living on your income,
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.120]   and you've got a $1 million investment portfolio. Lots and lots of, this describes kind of the,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.200]   probably the median listener of radical personal finance, median listener. So you've got a million
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:45.360]   dollar portfolio. Let's play with some numbers. Let's say you put 1% of your portfolio into
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:54.320]   speculative assets. So 1% of $1 million would be $10,000. So you're going to put 10,000 into
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:02.640]   speculative gambles. First, before I go to 1%, why do I think you should have some money in a
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   speculative portfolio? Well, I think it helps to protect the bulk of your portfolio from big
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:16.320]   mistakes. I think there are a lot of people who don't have a gambling money account who can
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.000]   probably feel frustrated when they miss out on things they would have liked to have gambled on.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.760]   If you have a speculative portion of your portfolio and you want to invest in Bitcoin,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.600]   and you're not sure about the future of Bitcoin, you could just invest it in Bitcoin or Dogecoin
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.160]   or GameStop or whatever it is, whatever game you want to play. Because you know, look, hey,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.120]   I have this percentage of my portfolio over here. This is speculation. I want to gamble on this.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.600]   And it allows you to feel like you're part of something. It allows you to educate yourself
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.240]   on something, but it doesn't put you in a position where you're risking too much.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.080]   So I think everybody needs a, it's almost a safety valve of sorts. You need a gambling portfolio
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.440]   so that you can just simply put money on, the guy at the barber shop says, "Hey, you should buy
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.920]   XYZ stock." You don't know anything about it. You should have a portfolio that you can pull
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.440]   out your phone and buy XYZ stock and just gamble on it just for fun. Okay. Now let's talk about the
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.160]   right number associated with it. What I like to do is I like to say, what would be the downside
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.560]   and what would be the upside? So let's start with downside. If you have a million dollar portfolio
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:27.280]   and you put 1% of that into a gambling speculative portfolio, that'd be $10,000.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:34.880]   If you lost $10,000, would that hurt? I think the obvious answer is not much, right? If you
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.640]   have a million dollar portfolio, make it a hundred grand a year, it's just not going to hurt much.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.880]   10,000 bucks, no big deal if it's gone. All right. So we got, we covered the downside. We
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.680]   know it's not too much to hurt, but here's the big question. Is it enough to matter?
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:56.160]   Well, let's run the numbers. Let's say that you have $10,000 and you invest it into something
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:02.880]   speculative that triples this year, right? You get a three X return this year and your $10,000
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:11.520]   grows into $30,000. Is that enough to matter? My guess would be probably not much, right?
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.080]   It's not going to, a person with a million dollars, so you've got a million, 30,000,
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.720]   okay, big deal, right? You're not going to change anything in your life in that situation.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:29.040]   So 1% of your portfolio in a gambling speculative portfolio environment is probably,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.080]   certainly not enough that it's going to hurt, but it's not enough that it's actually going to
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:38.400]   matter if you're successful. So it's probably too small. Now you could go and let's say you did 20%.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:47.200]   Well, 20% would be $200,000. If you lost $200,000 of your portfolio,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   would that be too much to lose? Could you afford to lose $200,000 of a million dollar portfolio?
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.280]   You judge for yourself. Some people, yeah, I could afford to lose it, right? I'm making $100,000 a
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:06.000]   year. Some people, no, that's too much, right? But then look at it the other way. Let's say that you
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.080]   tripled $200,000. You had a three X return this year on your speculative investment and you turned
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:18.000]   $200,000 into $600,000. Is that enough to matter? My answer is absolutely. Turning a million dollar
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.760]   portfolio into a million six because of a nice speculative investment, that's enough to matter.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.720]   And so think through these numbers, right? Think through the downside and the upside
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.760]   and try to find a number that would make sense for you. My guess would be that for most people,
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.600]   it would probably be something like 5% or 10% of your portfolio. Again, I can't say what yours is
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.360]   because the guy who has a million dollar portfolio and has no income coming in and is living on that
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.440]   million dollar portfolio is going to be very different in a different position from the guy
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.880]   that has a million dollar portfolio and is making a million dollars a year from his income, from his
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:01.200]   day job, right? That guy making a million dollars a year could say to himself, "Hey, I've only got a
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:07.120]   million dollars. I got a hunch on this thing. I'll go ahead and put half my money into this deal.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.920]   And if I can't do it, I'm not set behind much because I've got a big income." But you try to
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.560]   figure out a percentage that feels right for you. Now, on the flip side, let's go to safe and
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.440]   conservative assets. What percentage of your portfolio or your net worth should be invested
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:28.240]   in safe and conservative assets? Well, you want to do basically the same analysis. You want to say,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:34.320]   "I need a number that's meaningful. If I've got a million dollar portfolio and I've got $10,000
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.600]   in safe money, is that really meaningful? Is that going to do what I need? But I also need a number
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:48.320]   that's going to be significant enough to be meaningful, but not too much." Let's talk about
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.360]   life insurance, whole life insurance. My concern with whole life insurance as a primary tool for
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:59.120]   people is often that it's just too conservative. It's going to underperform most other things. It's
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.880]   going to be stable, but it's just too conservative often. And so that's why I get really nervous when
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:12.240]   people put too much of their income into too safe stuff. You shouldn't have 30% of your income going
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.840]   into some safe conservative CD account or money market account or life insurance policy. It's too
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:24.480]   much, too much, unless there's a specific goal for it. "I'm saving $200,000 so that I can build this
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.640]   million dollar, develop this million dollar real estate complex over here, and then I'll..." Okay,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:34.560]   that's fine. But in terms of just general ratios, too much. But yet, people that don't have anything
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:42.480]   saved, too little. So you got to find some kind of appropriate balance here where how much of my
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:48.720]   money do I need invested into something safe, something conservative. A ratio can work here.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:56.640]   I always keep 10% of my money in something safe. Or a number that's informed by something else.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.680]   I always keep three years worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. These are fine.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.440]   Now, there's other things that would involve other forms of asset allocation.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:15.280]   A percentage gives you the ability to take a bet on something without being committed to its success.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.600]   How much of your portfolio should be invested in gold?
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.760]   I'm uncomfortable if you get to that with anything except a percentage.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:34.640]   Maybe some people are okay with a number. Maybe you say, "I want to have 10 ounces of gold for
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.160]   every member of my family." I've talked about this, right? You're going to say, "I want to have
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.680]   10 ounces of gold for every member of my family. I'm going to have 10 one-ounce coins sewn in a
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.040]   money belt for every member of my family. So if we have to disappear in the middle of the night,
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.200]   and our family has to... We're being targeted or harassed for something, and we have got to set up
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.720]   shop in another country somewhere, at least we've got 10 ounces of gold to start with." Okay, that's
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.800]   fair, right? That could be fine. A personal goal like that can make a lot of sense. I like these
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.040]   because they give me a round number, but I think a percentage makes a lot of sense. I'm going to
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:13.200]   have 5% of my net worth in gold. That would be reasonable. I don't think 50% of your net worth
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.080]   is reasonable, but 5% is reasonable. And so you can, by choosing a percentage and going through
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:26.960]   that same analysis of, "This needs to be a big enough number to matter, but not so much that
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:33.440]   it's too big of a bet," you'll get to some of these numbers. You'll get to 5% of my portfolio
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.240]   should be invested in precious metals. 5% of my portfolio should be invested in cryptocurrency.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.680]   60% of my portfolio should be invested in large cap stocks, 20% in mid cap, etc.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   60% should be invested in Western stocks, other international stocks, whatever the number is.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:56.080]   That's all that asset allocation means. It's basically a way of deciding and saying,
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:03.680]   "We have this certain portfolio." Then we study and say, "How is this portfolio done in the past?"
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.240]   So therefore, it's probably going to do something like it in the future. Of course, we don't know
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.880]   that for sure. So do we like these results in the future that we had in the past? And then by
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:25.040]   committing to it and committing to that overall asset allocation plan, you have the freedom that
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:32.160]   comes with knowing, "I've covered my bases and I'm not being stupid in any area." That's the power.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:40.320]   You've covered your bases and you're not being stupid. The guy who doesn't have any cryptocurrency
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:48.400]   at all is probably feeling like he missed out. That can be a dangerous emotion because the fear
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.960]   of missing out can now pile up on you and then you do something rash or foolhardy, something
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.080]   that's just not wise for your situation. On the flip side, the guy that's got 100% of his money
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:07.120]   in cryptocurrency might not be sleeping very well at night. Maybe, maybe not. You just got to
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:12.880]   understand what are the risks here and what could I do. And the way to think about them is often in
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:26.560]   percentages. Percentages allow you to make an informed decision. Percentages are not perfect.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.640]   You need to always look at the situation and say, "What is someone doing?" For example,
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.600]   maybe you're a new college graduate. You've just graduated from college and you've just
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.800]   gotten your first job. You have no money saved, but you've just gotten your first job and you're
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:50.240]   making $60,000 a year. Well, percentages would say that you're in a wildly dangerous position.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:44:00.000]   Think about it. 100% of your income is being generated from one thing. Having a job is one
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.480]   of the riskiest things you could possibly do because if one income stream fails, you're sunk.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:13.600]   You've got nothing. Now, that's true. That's the thing that always drove me away from employment.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:19.120]   It's just employment is too risky. To have all of your income come from one source where they can
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.760]   call you up on Friday afternoon and say, "Don't come in on Monday," that's a big risk,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.680]   financially speaking. But of course, that's a risk that we take all the time. Why? Well,
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.360]   because that's where you start a lot of times. If you need money, one of the best ways to get
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.080]   money is to go get a job. You say, "This gives me a job and at the end of the day, it's not so risky.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.120]   So I'm going to go ahead and save some of my money. I'll build up a little bit of freedom,
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   a little bit of cushion, a little emergency fund, and I can go get another job if I need to."
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:51.840]   We can look at these same set of facts. But what we do is we look at the person making the $60,000
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:58.000]   and we say, "Where is he going to go from here? What's next?" I'm okay with taking big risks.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.240]   I'm okay with that person making $60,000 saying, "I'm going to save 50% of my income for one year,
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.800]   then I'm going to leave this job and I'm going to put 100% of my income into the next business."
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.480]   I think it's fine to take big risks if you're informed about them.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:22.400]   But during those times in life where you don't have a clear plan, you don't have a clear business
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.960]   I'm going to start or a clear career move I'm going to make or a clear way to make a fortune,
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.520]   the ratios can help to keep you safe. The ratios can help to make sure that you're being responsible
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.280]   and the ratios can make sure that you're balancing that goal of consuming enough today,
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:47.840]   enjoying things today, while also saving for the future. The ratios can help. So in closing,
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.640]   what I would suggest that you do is you think through the ratios that you believe make sense
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.280]   for you. I've tried to mention some that I think are useful and I'll give you a quick reprise of
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.960]   those things today. Here are the ratios that I would encourage my son or daughter to start with
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:14.000]   as a good starting point. Number one, with regard to the income, I think it makes a lot of sense to
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.120]   save half, spend half. Save half, spend half. What I currently encourage my children to do is
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.760]   whenever they make money we split into thirds. We give a third, we invest a third and we spend a
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:32.880]   third. That's fine, thirds work. I just do that because it makes the math easy with working with
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.480]   children. But for someone who's building an income and just starting, I think that giving away 10%
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:44.000]   of your money, saving 40% of your money and spending 50% I think is really a perfectly
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.320]   adequate scenario. Now the reason I like people to start with that is because if you get people
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.720]   starting with that then they don't ever have the pain of cutting back. I used to when I was younger
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.400]   and more aggressive and more excited about extreme savings. I would encourage people,
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   "Hey, get to half and half." I don't think it's necessary for most people. I don't think it's
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:11.360]   necessary for the average person making $100,000 a year to only spend $50,000. What makes a lot of
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:18.560]   sense to me is to the average person, if you have the ability, if you're the average person is
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:24.720]   living in a high tax country, let's say in the United States making $100,000 you're probably
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:31.840]   paying about $30,000 to $35,000 a year of tax. Well move to a no tax environment and then save
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:39.520]   the $30,000 to $35,000 a year of tax plus what you were doing before. You'll have in most high
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.560]   tax places, you'll have someone making $100,000. Again, they're going to be spending $30,000 to
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:53.280]   $35,000 a year on tax depending on how much of their wages are employment wages. There's 15.3%
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.440]   in the United States of tax on $100,000 for Social Security and Medicare. Then depending on whether
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.560]   they're married, do they have children, what are the deductions that they have, are they enrolled
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.160]   in a retirement plan, et cetera. But you would often have another $7,500 a year of income tax
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.440]   on the first $100,000. So you would get up to a total of something like, excuse me, you would
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.240]   often have about 15%. You would often get up to a total depending on state tax, et cetera, of say
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:26.160]   $30,000 of tax on $100,000 income. Well now if you take $100,000 and you turn it into $70,000 after
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.440]   tax and then you tell someone live on half your income, if you're going to calculate it based
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:37.520]   upon the net, now all of a sudden they're down to a $35,000 annual expense, which is probably a
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:43.920]   little bit heavy for most of us that make $100,000 a year. So you can do something, my recommendation
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:49.680]   if someone's capable is move into a more tax efficient environment, move to a tax haven,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:57.840]   cut your taxes on $100,000 to zero legally, and then save the tax money plus the other 15%, 20%,
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:04.320]   and just live on 50% or 60%. It's a better solution. So forgive me for the tangent,
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.960]   just the point is if you can often get to things in a creative way. So save 20%, give 10%, live on
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:18.240]   70. These are good ratios. At least 10% of money saved, my number is probably not higher than 50%.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:24.960]   On investments and asset allocations, I think that something in the range of 10%
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:32.400]   of your assets invested in something safe, conservative, and stable feels pretty good to me.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.200]   Another 10% invested in something that's speculative, when you run those numbers,
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:44.000]   that often seems to be the kind of number that's pretty good. And then the 80% invested in something
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.760]   that is strong, aggressive, but not so totally speculative that you could lose it all.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.640]   I'm not married to those numbers, but those are the kinds of ratios that I would encourage someone
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.160]   to think about. On housing expenses, I say no more than 10% of your net worth into a personal house.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:07.600]   If you can borrow the money and keep it down to say 25% to 30%, somewhere in that range of your
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:12.800]   income and cover the mortgage payment, it's probably reasonable. But no more than 10% of
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:19.360]   your net worth in a house. And then when it comes to other consumption items, I say 10% to maybe 20%,
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:32.640]   certainly no higher than 50% of your income going into consumption items like cars, boats,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.040]   that kind of stuff. Because those things just, you lose too much value. Do that until you're
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.760]   a multimillionaire. And then once you're a multimillionaire, think about your insurance
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:45.920]   funds. If you put 10% of your money in cash, 10% of your money in gold, 10% of your money in
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.200]   cryptocurrency, then you keep 50% invested in your business or 50% invested in stocks. These are the
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.800]   kinds of ratios that give you comfort. Because you know you've got exposure to multiple things,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:02.880]   but you're not overexposed in multiple areas. In conclusion, think about the ratios that you
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.680]   believe in. As I've said, there's nothing scientific about these ratios. We can do an analysis
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.760]   of percentage of savings, right? I've talked about the math of early retirement, the famous
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.880]   charts that Jacob Lund Fisker outlined in his book, Early Retirement Extreme,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:24.160]   that Mr. Money Mustache profiled in his blog. I've got episodes of the show on how inspirational that
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.520]   was to me. If you haven't heard that, go all the way back to episode 163, published in March of
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:37.120]   2015, called The Impact of Your Savings Rate on Your Time to Financial Independence. So that math
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:45.440]   works, but math can always be broken, right? For example, the math behind that movement, that idea
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.840]   would say that if you save 10% of your income, you could take one year off every time you work
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:54.960]   nine years. If you go forward and you say save 10% of your income over your working career, it'll
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.840]   take you something like 45 years under standard kind of stock market expectations to become
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:05.760]   financially independent. There's nothing wrong with that. But you could also save 0% of your
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:12.240]   income and be like my client who built a massive tech company and sold it out after about eight
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:17.200]   years of work and became a multi-multi-millionaire because he exited his tech company and saved 0%
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.440]   along the way, lived on credit cards the whole time until he got it profitable, had a few years
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.160]   of good income, and then sold and exited with a massive deal. So there's always a way to break
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:33.200]   the math. But you want to understand the math before you start breaking the rules. The artists
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:42.480]   who break the rules effectively are those who understand the rule and then how breaking it can
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:51.040]   bring an impact. If I use poor language, let's say I come out here and I start using a word like ain't
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:58.720]   or a word like funnest or something like these. I can use those words as a skilled public speaker.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:05.680]   I can come out and I can use these words, these mistakes in the English language, and I can break
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.120]   the rules and it works for impact. I might say something like well that ain't gonna work for you.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:18.560]   And I have an emphasis that comes from breaking the rules of the English language,
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.440]   breaking the rules of speaking with proper English grammar.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   But I can only do that effectively because I understand the rule and then I break the
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:35.760]   rule when it matters. There's a big difference between me coming out, between my coming out,
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:42.000]   here we go, there's a big difference between my coming out and speaking eloquently and effectively
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.840]   on a topic and then for emphasis saying well that ain't gonna work out so well for you, is it?
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:56.720]   Versus my coming out and from the very beginning of the show to the end speaking like an uneducated
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:06.640]   hick. Same thing comes to place with these ratios. There's a big difference between a financial
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   advisor like me saying to somebody right now I don't think you should pay off your credit card
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:22.400]   debt because in my estimation you have a working business here that's growing and you're using the
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:28.080]   credit card debt to fund your lifestyle and to cover enough living expenses so that you can
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:35.280]   get this business growing and we're gonna break these rules about spending less and spending
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.920]   credit card debt and piling up debt, blah blah blah blah blah, etc. temporarily to see if this
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:46.160]   works. That was the advice that I gave. My client was spending a lot of money, going out to eat a
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.680]   lot, living not an extravagant but living a non-frugal lifestyle. Why? Well he had a bunch
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:56.400]   of children and he was trying to keep his family going while he got this business going and by
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.440]   spending money on the home front it freed him up enough to get the business going and so the right
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:06.080]   plan at that point was not to come in and say what you need to do is you need to put your household
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.520]   on a budget and you need to tell your wife while she's taking care of all these children you need
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.360]   to tell your wife honey you got to spend a maximum of $450 at the grocery store. That would have been
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:19.120]   a suicide right and it would have broken his whole plan of building the business but a few years of
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:27.200]   just limping along and then exiting the business it worked right so you can break the rules on
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:32.080]   occasion if you know them but you can't make a habit of breaking the rules and that's where the
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:38.160]   ratios come in. Could you convince me if you were a sharp young lawyer you've just graduated from
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.440]   the best law school in the land you've gotten a job could or you're getting a job could you convince
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:51.280]   me that you need to come in and lease a brand new very nice BMW for $2,000 a month? Answer is yes.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:56.400]   I could absolutely be convinced of that. Signaling matters and so if you're going to signal yourself
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:04.480]   as the hot shot who is extremely successful I think that absolutely can work but we're not
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:12.080]   going to apply the same thinking as a general rule to the guy that just got a store manager job.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:20.880]   It's suicide for the guy who just got a job as a store manager to go out and have the same $2,000
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:26.080]   a month lease payment. Hope you understand. Hope that's a helpful addendum here at the end. You
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.440]   need to understand what the rules are in order to understand when it's okay for you to break them.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.760]   You can't just go out and break the financial rules willy-nilly and expect it to work out
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.800]   well for you. Thank you for listening to my show today. I hope this is useful to you.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.720]   I would remind you that I sell a course called the Radical Personal Finance Guide to Career and
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:52.640]   Income Planning and the single most effective thing that you can do to build your financial
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:58.480]   life in a way that allows you to properly balance building wealth and also enjoying consumption
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:05.520]   is to increase your income. I spent far too many years of my life focusing on frugality.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:11.200]   That was a mistake. If I had spent that same time focusing on building my income,
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:16.080]   I would have had all the things that I was trying to get with frugality, namely higher savings,
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.440]   higher investments, but a whole lot more of the things that weren't available with frugality,
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.240]   more vivid high-class experiences, richer memories, etc. if I had focused earlier on
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.280]   building my income. So don't make my mistake. Don't repeat my mistake. From the very beginning,
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:39.680]   you should have a plan to build your income. So if you don't have one of those plans,
