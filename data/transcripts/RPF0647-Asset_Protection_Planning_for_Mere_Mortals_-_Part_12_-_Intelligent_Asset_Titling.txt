[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.920]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.600]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.080]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.680]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.320]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.920]   Today we pick up our asset protection planning
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.600]   from Mere Mortals series.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.160]   This is part 12 of the series titled,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.080]   called Intelligent Asset Titling.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.200]   That's today's show, Intelligent Asset Titling.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.080]   Quick bit of refresher, this series is focused
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.440]   on helping ordinary people to put in place
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.720]   basic asset protection plans.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.120]   And I have focused heavily on knowledge
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.680]   and I've focused heavily on things that you can do
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.040]   without necessarily consulting a financial professional,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.160]   consulting a legal professional.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160]   All along the way in this series,
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.000]   I've tried to explain to you how certain things work
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.320]   and what things are available to you.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.880]   And most of what we've talked about
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.960]   is just simply a matter of your knowledge
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.640]   and adjusting your affairs to line up with your knowledge.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.960]   I haven't talked about the things that are more complex
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.080]   or the things where you need specific advice.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.040]   Now we're getting to the end of this particular series
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.800]   because we're starting to cross that barrier
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.840]   between things that are easy for a do-it-yourselfer to do
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.960]   versus things where you'll start to want
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740]   to solicit professional financial advice,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.520]   professional legal advice from an attorney
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.600]   who specializes in asset protection planning.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.360]   This show is very much on the borderline,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.980]   but I'm still gonna take a crack at it
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.120]   because I at least want you to get some basic concepts.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.720]   And then some of my listeners who are more confident
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.000]   in their DIY skills will be able to go ahead
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.680]   and put some strategies in place.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.480]   And some of my listeners will go ahead
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   and start to choose to consult with legal professionals.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.920]   But this is where we're gonna start to cross that border,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.960]   which is why this particular series is coming to an end.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.520]   This show is also where some of these strategies
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.340]   become more complex.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.780]   And individualized situations
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.640]   will make a much bigger difference.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.160]   So just be aware of that.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.840]   I'm gonna speak fairly broadly in this show.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.000]   It'll still be useful.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.640]   I'm not running from details,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.700]   but there are so many little details
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.200]   that will come into play that we just gotta,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.560]   we gotta be careful of that.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.000]   So first, be aware of the fact
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.600]   that it is probably not possible for you or me
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.160]   to create and actually maintain
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.560]   a perfect asset protection plan.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.800]   Now, we might be able to design one.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.600]   We might be able to put in place
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.720]   so many barriers and lines of defense
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.760]   that it is in effect the perfect plan.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.360]   But we may not be able to afford it
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.940]   to actually pay all the necessary fees,
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.920]   whether it's annual fees for entity maintenance,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.880]   whether it's legal fees for entity creation,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.240]   whether it's tax fees for tax compliance.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.680]   And we may simply not be able to keep on top
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.280]   of the administrative complexity.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.600]   Many a good asset protection plan has failed
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.320]   because the person who established it didn't maintain it.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.800]   For example, if you own a corporation,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.920]   are you actually maintaining your corporation?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.120]   Are you actually doing your annual meetings?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.760]   Are you keeping your minutes?
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   Are you keeping your corporate records properly
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.600]   so that they'll stand up in the court of law?
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.900]   And the same thing applies to you
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.600]   even if you are maintaining a simpler entity
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360]   or a series of entities such as an LLC
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.080]   or a series of LLCs.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.600]   LLCs have fewer administrative burdens.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.720]   That's one of the reasons why they're so popular.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.400]   But in order to maintain the protection
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.740]   that an LLC can offer,
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.640]   you still need to be treating it very carefully
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.600]   and maintaining it very carefully.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.240]   That can become very burdensome after a while.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.160]   And so there's always a balance here
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   between what is ultimately ideal
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.040]   and what can actually be maintained.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   Be aware of that.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.440]   I'm gonna talk about some concepts
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.480]   and you might go as my brain usually would
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.340]   to oh, I'll go to this extreme.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.920]   I'll tell you, I've been there, done that.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.280]   And sometimes you just can't maintain the ultimate plan.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.480]   So if you don't have an actual need for it,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.320]   go slow, take it easy, little by little.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.000]   The expense and complexity of a really fantastic plan
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240]   might ultimately lead to it failing,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.620]   in which case the simpler plan
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.900]   might have been a superior choice.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.360]   The other thing you should be aware of is
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.520]   as we go through this show,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.760]   some things will work for asset protection,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.880]   although they might not ultimately protect you in court.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.060]   Remember we talked about the different stages
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.400]   of asset protection.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   Much earlier in this series,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   we spoke extensively on the subject of financial privacy.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.080]   And we talked about how if you have a lower profile
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.960]   because your assets are fairly private,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.840]   that may help to protect you
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.520]   from simply not being seen
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.400]   as a potential deep pocket defendant.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.160]   If you have a big footprint,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.880]   you will be targeted more because of your deep pockets.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.460]   There will be many potential people and attorneys
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.520]   looking for a deep pocket defendant.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.640]   But if you are not perceived to have deep pockets,
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.900]   that can protect you.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.400]   But that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.160]   that you can keep all of your assets totally secret.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.760]   If you wind up having to submit to a debtor's examination
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.120]   to satisfy a judgment creditor,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.320]   you're going to have to disclose your assets.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.960]   So when we talk about something simple,
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.600]   for example, let's say that you have an asset
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.520]   that you own personally,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.360]   but you just simply place it into a trust or an LLC.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.600]   That can provide some significant asset protection,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.580]   although it's not the ironclad legal protection
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.440]   that means your creditors
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.360]   could never get their hands on it.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.060]   So some of these different things we're gonna talk about
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.840]   will provide de facto asset protection,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.720]   which is real asset protection
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.560]   because it actually does, it makes you a lower profile.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.960]   Somebody is not necessarily aware of everything you own,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.320]   but it doesn't mean that ultimately
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.240]   it couldn't be undone in a court of law.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.920]   Whereas some of these strategies do have the legal strength
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.120]   so that they would stand up.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.040]   And even if you had to disclose your ownership
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.840]   of a certain asset, that ownership can still be protected.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   Now, if you're aware of those things, we can dig in.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.160]   A couple of basic concepts for you to consider
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.360]   when it comes to asset protection,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.880]   specifically with regard to asset titling.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.360]   Remember that ownership of an asset
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   is not necessarily synonymous with the use of an asset.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.920]   And I'm from Florida, and one of the jokes
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.680]   that most Floridians would say,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.880]   or would at least be aware of,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.720]   and we've heard it dozens of times,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.200]   is it's a lot better to have a friend with a boat
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.980]   than it is to actually own a boat.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.200]   And it's a joke because it's true.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.880]   Everyone knows that there are those famous jokes
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.120]   about boats, which I've heard and said so many times,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   I'm not gonna repeat them.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.560]   And so many people say, I don't wanna own a boat,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.920]   I just wanna be able to use a boat.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.560]   So if you've got a friend with a boat,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.640]   most people who have boats don't really use them.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.400]   If you've got a good friend who doesn't mind
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.360]   your taking and using their boat,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.780]   then in many ways, you've got the best of both worlds.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.440]   The ownership of the boat may or may not
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.880]   be actually what you want.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.720]   You may just want the use of the boat.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.060]   And there are many ways for you to be able to use a boat.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.000]   You can use a friend's boat.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.480]   You can use a boat club membership
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.760]   and use the membership's boats.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.480]   Or you can use a boat that is owned by some entity
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.600]   in which you have an interest.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.080]   So if you always remember that ownership
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.600]   is not necessarily the synonymous with use,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.620]   you'll start to see how intelligent asset titling
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.000]   can be used.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.680]   Most of us would like to be able to use assets
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.880]   or get some certain beneficial interest from the asset,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.380]   but that doesn't necessarily mean that we,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.560]   individually, in our own names,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.020]   have to be the one who actually owns the asset.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.280]   I'm gonna stick with simple examples,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.020]   but another simple example would be something
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.920]   like a company car.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.180]   If you're issued a company car by your company,
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.400]   you get to use that car under the terms
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.040]   agreed on with your company.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.740]   Sometimes those terms are simply designated
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.320]   by your company that you can use it to go
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.400]   from your house to your office,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.480]   or simply while you're on sales calls,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.640]   or things like that.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.160]   Sometimes the use of the company car
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.120]   is fairly liberal and fairly broad.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.480]   Now here, there's a big difference between tax planning,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.160]   which is where you have to account for use of the car
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.720]   under the benefits program for personal use
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   versus on-the-job use,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.040]   which is often why things are restricted.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.720]   There's a big difference between tax planning
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.960]   and asset protection planning.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   Your company can own a car and you can use the car.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.800]   And you, when someone's looking for your assets,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.200]   you're not listed as an owner of the car.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.600]   Now if you work for a company that's a publicly traded
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.920]   company with millions of stockholders,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.080]   well certainly, you don't own the car.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.800]   But you still don't own the car,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.600]   even if you work for a company
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.900]   that has one single stockholder, you.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.480]   You still don't own the car.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.340]   The company owns the car,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.360]   and you have an agreement with the company
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.420]   as part of your overall benefits package
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.280]   for you to drive the car
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.560]   under the terms agreed on with your company.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.720]   Again, I'm gonna ignore the tax consequences,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.880]   'cause usually that's where we get into,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.280]   well, how can I do this very tax efficiently?
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.520]   In this case, we're just talking about asset protection.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.800]   You don't own the car anymore.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.040]   Your company owns the car.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.800]   But you can use the car.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.220]   You can park the car in your driveway.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.660]   You can take the car to the grocery store.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.680]   You can take the car to work.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.760]   You can put your kids in the car,
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.120]   take them to soccer practice.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.760]   You can use the car if it's agreed on
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.180]   in the agreement you have with your company.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.480]   Now, that's not to say you don't own any asset.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.500]   What you own is shares of stock.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.740]   You own shares of a company,
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.300]   and the shares of, the value of those shares
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.420]   of your company is going to include
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.300]   the book value of your car.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.140]   So it's not as though you don't own an asset.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.500]   In that case, you own the shares of the company,
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.520]   but you don't own the car.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.580]   I don't know of a simpler example I could use
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.760]   to try to show you that ownership
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.340]   is not necessarily synonymous with use.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.220]   Now, as you start to look at your assets,
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.340]   and you start to look at things
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.860]   that you'd like to enjoy in your life,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.420]   what you'll see is there are ways
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.640]   that you can structure almost anything you want to do
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.240]   so that you don't actually own the asset,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.620]   but rather someone else or some other entity owns the asset.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.340]   That's basically what we do with asset titling.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.500]   We think about what's the best way
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.360]   for us to title this asset.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.180]   So think about that.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.260]   Ownership is not synonymous with use.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.660]   Next, when you're engaging in things
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.660]   that are risky in your life,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.820]   it's important that you compartmentalize the risk,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.780]   that you try to segregate the risk as best you can.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.980]   And that's where asset titling and entities
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.700]   are going to come into play.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.060]   If you have, if you're exposed to risk,
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   everybody is exposed to a certain amount of risk.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.660]   If you're driving down the road,
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.620]   you're gonna be exposed to a certain amount of risk.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.860]   If you walk out of your house, if you do anything,
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.980]   you're gonna be exposed to certain amounts of risk.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.580]   But then there are some activities in life
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.940]   that are going to expose you to more risk.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.540]   And so one of the things that you wanna do
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.980]   with intelligent asset titling
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.420]   is you want to compartmentalize the risk as much as you can.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.100]   The obvious way to do this here is to use,
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.500]   in the Western tradition, is to use business entities.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.140]   There is a long and robust history
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.800]   of court precedent and laws that protect
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.340]   the ability of companies to limit the risk.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.500]   If you're concerned about whether this is okay,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.420]   whether this is moral, et cetera,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.960]   there are philosophical discussions on it.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.300]   I'm not gonna spend any time on that discussion here.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.820]   It is, this is what occurs.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.380]   And at least in the Western context,
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.180]   there is a very high degree of respect
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.460]   for the limited risk, the protection from risk,
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.480]   the limited liability of companies
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.840]   if the rules are properly followed,
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.520]   if the company is properly maintained.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.580]   And these entities exist in virtually all Western societies
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.420]   and probably in almost any place in the world,
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.220]   but I'd be nervous about making blanket statements
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.680]   at places I haven't researched.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.420]   And so you wanna use these types of companies
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.040]   to compartmentalize the risk and limit the risk to you.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.700]   With regard to asset titling,
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.840]   the other thing that you can do is you can make sure
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.000]   that you split assets into ownership structures
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.040]   that don't have risk.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.080]   So you can use business entities to compartmentalize risk
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.520]   and you can split assets out of those entities
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.320]   into other entities that don't have risk.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   Give you just a very simple example.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.360]   Let's pretend that I were running
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.840]   a road construction company.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.520]   And so as part of this road construction company
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   or perhaps as part of a,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.900]   we do road construction, we do site development,
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.940]   things like that.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.980]   And so as part of this road construction company
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.660]   and the site development company,
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.640]   my company has the need for very big tractors,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.620]   tools, bulldozers, trucks,
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.060]   all these big expensive machines.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.220]   These things are crazy expensive,
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.460]   which means that they're an extremely valuable asset.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.920]   But the use of these machines
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.220]   also involves a significant amount of risk.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.540]   There's a major amount of risk of property damage.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.540]   If I back my massive bulldozer into somebody's property,
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.940]   I could punch a hole in the wall of their house,
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.420]   I could run over their car, something could happen.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.900]   And there's also just a general risk
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.820]   if I mess something up badly
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.980]   and I'm subject to a claim on the company.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.140]   I face a lot of risk
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.940]   with this kind of big, heavy construction equipment.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.220]   I have a lot of guys
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.820]   who are gonna be around this equipment
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.380]   and one of those guys might get their leg run over.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:23.080]   Our equipment is dangerous.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.340]   So it's valuable, but it's dangerous.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.980]   So I come to this problem
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.660]   and there are different ways to look at it.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.980]   So the first thing that I would probably look at
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.900]   is as a prudent business owner,
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.420]   I would say I need to protect myself
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.460]   from the risk of my business.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.300]   Because if one of my guys runs over somebody
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.620]   and kills somebody,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.620]   I wanna make sure that my personal assets
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.700]   are not available to the potential creditors.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.340]   After all, if I've spent years working up,
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.440]   building up assets, I've got money,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.060]   I've got investment assets, I've got real estate,
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.220]   I gotta make sure that's not exposed
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.140]   to the claims of creditors.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.740]   So the obvious solution is I start a company.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.060]   I start the Joshua Sheets Land Company.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.300]   And this is a limited risk entity.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.300]   It's either a corporation or a limited liability company
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.820]   and I've established it as a company.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.060]   Now, what does that do for me?
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.420]   First thing it does is it limits the ability
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.180]   of a creditor for the company
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.780]   to come at my personal assets.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.620]   Now, the company itself has to stand good
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.940]   for what the company owns, what the company owes.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.640]   So if I have $500,000 of equipment
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.300]   in the company and one of my guys kills somebody
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.500]   and we have a $500,000 lawsuit,
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.540]   well, our creditor, in that case,
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.540]   the person who won the lawsuit against us,
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.500]   our creditor can force us to sell the equipment
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.940]   and satisfy the debt.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.060]   They can force us to disgorge the money from the company
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.660]   and pay off the debt.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.380]   So the company has to stand good for the risks.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.280]   But if I take this one step further
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.220]   and I think about segmenting out the ownership of the assets
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.620]   into an ownership structure that doesn't have risk,
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.540]   then what would probably be a better move
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.700]   is instead of establishing one company,
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.740]   to go ahead and establish two.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.900]   And what we do is company A is the operations company.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.140]   The operations company is the company
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.900]   that hires the employees.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.540]   It's the company that does the contracts,
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.780]   makes contracts with people to do work.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.080]   It's the company that has the public face
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.320]   of all of the Joshua Sheets land clearing company.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.300]   That's the company that does the work.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.480]   Now that company ideally should very have minimal assets.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.820]   It must have enough money to have operating capital.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.240]   We have to make sure it was properly funded.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.160]   That would be very important
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.880]   for maintaining our corporate veil.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.280]   So we gotta make sure it's properly funded,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.440]   it does have some money in it and it's properly run,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.120]   but ultimately it doesn't need to have everything in it.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.420]   Now the second thing that we would do
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.200]   is we would establish a second company
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.120]   that would be a holding company for the heavy equipment.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.720]   And so this might be Joshua's
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.920]   heavy equipment renting company.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.600]   And so that's the company that will own
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.520]   all of the heavy equipment.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.300]   And then that company will establish a lease agreement
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.880]   with Joshua Sheets land clearing company,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.440]   and it will lease the equipment
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.880]   to the land clearing company.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.220]   Well, what does this do?
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.660]   This splits the asset ownership out
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.040]   and it compartmentalizes the risk.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.080]   The asset holding company will have almost no risk.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.000]   First, it will have no employees.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.640]   So the asset holding company will not be subject
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.040]   to liability for the actions of any employees.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   It won't be subject to any employee gets drunk
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.540]   and does something stupid while they're driving a bulldozer.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.260]   Well, there is no employee to do that.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.020]   It won't be subject to a sexual harassment lawsuit.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.500]   Doesn't have any employees.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.940]   So there's no risk from employees.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.680]   And we can cut off, it makes no contracts
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.980]   with customers other than the operations company.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.180]   So we're not worried then about it going
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.280]   and breaking a contract.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.980]   We're not worried about this company
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.420]   damaging somebody's property, something like that.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.760]   It just holds assets.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.880]   So there's almost no risk,
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.080]   but it's an extremely valuable company
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.160]   because it has massive amounts of assets in it.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.580]   So if you have a lot of assets,
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.520]   you wanna make sure that they're held within an entity
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   that doesn't have a lot of risk.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.200]   If you're gonna have an entity that has a lot of risk,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.520]   you wanna do your best to make sure
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.360]   that that entity has modest assets within it.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.300]   You don't wanna expose everything to it.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.240]   So you can split the assets out and move them
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.660]   and then just simply put in place legal structures.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.660]   And this is what almost any big company does.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.980]   If you go and you see a Walmart truck
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.680]   driving down the highway
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.980]   that's delivering food to Walmart stores,
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.980]   that truck is not owned by the big Walmart corporation.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.560]   It's owned by a subsidiary of the big Walmart corporation.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.900]   It's a separate entity.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.220]   So big companies do this kind of thing all the time.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.400]   You can too.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.440]   There's nothing special that Walmart has access to
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.980]   that you don't.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.600]   You have the same laws that govern your life
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.760]   as Walmart corporation does.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.520]   They just simply have the money to pay people
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.560]   to establish the plans and to maintain the structures.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.520]   Back to that thing I said,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.720]   the cost of compliance with expenses
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.300]   and then complexity of maintaining things.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.540]   Because if you just simply run everything together,
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.280]   if you don't actually maintain the assets separately,
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.040]   if you don't actually maintain the companies separately,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.160]   then it falls apart.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.400]   Because I guarantee you,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.840]   both corporations are gonna be named in the lawsuit.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.380]   And so that's where you wanna get good legal advice.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.880]   You would ideally have different owners
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.560]   in both of those companies, a different set of owners.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.560]   You wouldn't just wanna make it Joshua owns
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.840]   both of those together
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.580]   'cause then you basically lose your asset protection.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.800]   You want a different set of owners for the holding company
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.960]   than for the operations company.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.640]   But you can move assets into various kinds of structures.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.440]   And this will also help you again
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.280]   with regard to privacy.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.960]   Entities and structures are one of your keys for privacy.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.360]   So let's first talk with some of the simple assets.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.400]   And let's keep things very simple first.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.900]   Who owns an asset?
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.680]   Is it you?
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.120]   Are you the right person to own the asset?
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.720]   If you're gonna go and buy a boat,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.300]   should you own the boat?
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.400]   Should someone else own the boat?
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.340]   One of the most valuable strategies
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.040]   is to think about a person who has relatively low risk.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.360]   For example, if you are married,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.360]   one of you will probably have a higher risk than the other.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:10.180]   If one person in a marriage relationship is a doctor,
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.240]   that doctor will be exposed to the risk
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.260]   of medical malpractices, every doctor knows.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.840]   But if the other spouse is not a doctor,
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.600]   they'll have lower risk.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.300]   If one spouse is highly public or very active in something,
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.800]   and the other spouse is more private,
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.360]   well, consider which spouse should own the boat.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.140]   Generally, if you're gonna own certain assets,
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.380]   you wanna think about making sure that a person
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.380]   with the lowest amount of risk owns the asset.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.480]   This isn't a bad strategy,
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.520]   and it's not a bad strategy to start with.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.840]   But as with most of these strategies,
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.280]   we can talk about some potential problems.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.360]   It's not a perfect strategy.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.560]   It's good for you to consider,
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.160]   but it's not a perfect strategy.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.000]   There are a couple problems that come in
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.600]   with just simply titling assets in the name
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.080]   of a spouse that has lower risk,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.520]   that has less vulnerability.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.600]   The first thing would be what state do you live in,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.640]   and what are the laws that govern
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.920]   marital property in that state?
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.700]   It makes a big difference whether you live
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.560]   in a community property state
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.080]   versus a non-community property state.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.720]   In the United States,
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.640]   there are 10 community property states.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.480]   They are Alaska, Arizona, California,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.560]   Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.800]   In a community state, all marital property
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   is automatically deemed to be owned half by each spouse,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.840]   even if only one spouse is listed on the deed.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.220]   So if you live in a community property state,
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.980]   such as, most importantly for a huge number
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.040]   of my listeners, California,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.560]   if you buy the boat or if you buy the house
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   and you title it into the name of the lower-risk spouse,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.460]   that won't automatically protect you
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.800]   because you're automatically understood
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.820]   to own 50% of the property,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.620]   even though it's just simply titled
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.200]   in the name of the spouse.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.600]   That's a real problem.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.240]   Now, it is possible to establish
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.880]   a transmutation agreement,
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.600]   which is a post-nuptial agreement
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.480]   that indicates that you are keeping a certain asset
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.860]   outside of the community estate.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.580]   Even in a community state,
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.180]   just because somebody owns something
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.420]   doesn't mean it automatically becomes community property.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   For example, if you own a house prior to becoming married,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.020]   you don't lose the ownership of that house
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.740]   to community property.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.820]   But if you buy a house after becoming married,
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.180]   then it's automatically considered
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.060]   to be community property.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.860]   So you could establish a transmutation agreement
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.480]   and have a post-nuptial agreement in place
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.940]   that would designate a certain asset
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.680]   to be still owned by one single spouse,
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.260]   the spouse that has, in your case,
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.240]   the lower amount of risk.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.620]   That can work.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.620]   But you should then next see the obvious risk
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.060]   would be what would then happen in divorce.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.780]   One of the most likely forms of asset protection
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.460]   that most people would wind up needing
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.060]   would be in a divorce.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.300]   If we were to deal with the probability
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.180]   of your being sued because you were a deep pocket creditor
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.620]   and losing a lawsuit
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.840]   versus the probability of your becoming divorced
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.600]   and losing assets in a divorce agreement,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.780]   I don't know the statistics,
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.660]   but the threat of number two is far higher
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.340]   than the threat of number one.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.700]   So the action that you take
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.140]   that could protect you from threat number one
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.620]   could also subject you to much greater risk
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.420]   for threat number two.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.620]   If my wife and I are married
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.460]   and we title all of our assets into her name
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.500]   and we clearly establish that as non-community property,
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.800]   as non-marital property,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.320]   we clearly establish it to be separate property,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.740]   her separate property,
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.860]   and then we go to divorce court,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.740]   well, she'll have all that property
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.940]   on the other side of divorce court.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.700]   And if she doesn't have it
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.280]   on the other side of divorce court,
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.180]   we'd go back to the asset protection plan.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.680]   It wouldn't protect us in the asset protection plan
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.260]   because states are increasingly attacking this idea
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.620]   and increasingly considering more and more
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.020]   that all of the assets of both spouses
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.680]   are considered to be available for creditors.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.200]   There is an additional,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.900]   there are wrinkles in different states,
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.980]   but there's a long list of states
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.780]   that are starting to approve court actions
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.220]   where just because it's titled in one spouse's name
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.100]   doesn't mean it's not necessarily available
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.800]   to the other spouse's creditors.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.980]   The other big risk you would face
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.200]   would be making gifts to a spouse
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.660]   could very easily run afoul
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.820]   of the fraudulent transfers legislation
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:07.820]   because gifts are very tricky to do them right.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.120]   Now, so now if you were do that,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.040]   if you make a gift to your spouse
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.080]   long before any circumstances
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.480]   leading to a lawsuit actually happen,
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.880]   then you don't really need to worry
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.120]   about the fraudulent transfers legislation.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.800]   But if you all of a sudden,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.680]   you know, you go and wind up accidentally killing somebody,
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.880]   and then the next day you go and transfer
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.620]   all of your assets and you establish
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.520]   a transmutation agreement making sure
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.440]   that your spouse owns all the assets,
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.360]   you've got a problem.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.400]   That could very easily be ruled as a fraudulent transfer.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.200]   You say, well, maybe I could sell the assets to my spouse.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   Problem is you have now sold assets to an insider,
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.780]   and what do you tell the court
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.800]   as to why you said all of a sudden
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.200]   the day after you killed somebody
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.000]   or the month after you killed somebody,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.960]   you all of a sudden sold all your assets
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.120]   to your spouse.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.040]   If they can, if the judge can determine
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.840]   that that sale was to protect assets,
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.360]   which is in that case probably
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.200]   the only logical explanation for your actions,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.240]   then that in and of itself can be deemed
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.080]   as evidence of your intent to defraud your creditors.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.280]   And so thus at that point in time,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.600]   that transfer can be undone.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.120]   So the first thing to think about
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.220]   is who should own something?
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.800]   Should you own it or should somebody else?
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.520]   And that most likely somebody else would be your spouse,
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.760]   especially if your spouse owns lower amounts of risk,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.240]   has lower amounts of risk.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.160]   Now this could also then add administrative complexity.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.720]   For example, over the years
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   as my wife and I have titled various assets,
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.280]   we've often found the challenge
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.880]   of just simply managing the assets.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.180]   If both of you are listed as the owners of a certain asset,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.720]   then all of a sudden now both of you
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.120]   have to sign all the papers.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.480]   And so something as simple as having a car
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.000]   that's owned by both of you
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.520]   now requires two sets of signatures,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.680]   requires two people to sit in line for five hours
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.640]   at the DMV and deal with all the government stuff.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.240]   It just, it winds up being complex.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.080]   So again, we have the problem here
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.860]   of administrative complexity
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.780]   as compared to perfect solution.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.780]   Now, there are some perhaps more powerful things to consider
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.660]   when we come to ownership.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.000]   And that would be something like joint ownership.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.480]   When we talked just a moment ago
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.000]   about one spouse or the other owning the asset,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.240]   we were talking about one individual owning the asset
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.160]   and which individual should it be.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.560]   And by the way, that individual
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   certainly doesn't have to be just you and your spouse.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.720]   And in fact, at the end of the show,
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.320]   I'll touch briefly on nominees,
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.140]   but let's say that your dad is retired
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.400]   and your dad goes and buys a boat
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.060]   and just so happens to park it at your house
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.140]   and allow you to use it whenever you want to.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.980]   And you just so happen to have given your dad
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.940]   a large gift of money a couple years ago
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.660]   for him to buy a boat.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   Well, you face a small risk
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.500]   of possibly your dad getting sued
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.040]   and then the boat that he owns
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.780]   becoming subject to a creditor.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.820]   But if your dad is retired,
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.440]   doesn't have any major exposure,
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.560]   it's probably not that big of a deal.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.720]   And if you don't think that your dad
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.320]   is just all of a sudden gonna take the boat
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.480]   and run away in the middle of the night and sell it,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.600]   probably the fact that your dad owns the boat,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.160]   but you happen to use it whenever you want
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.280]   is a pretty decent, very simple asset protection plan
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.880]   for your boat if you have a high profile.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.560]   So that would be the strategy of using a nominee.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.520]   Nothing illegal about anything I just said,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.120]   it's all perfectly above board.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.000]   But that's the strategy of using a nominee.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.280]   We'll cover that at the end of the show.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.440]   So what about other forms of owning an asset together?
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   What about actually having some sort of co-ownership?
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.960]   Well, here there are three basic types of co-ownership.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.460]   You need to understand what they mean
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.280]   so that if you ever own an asset with another person
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.200]   or another entity,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.380]   you understand what your rights and protections are.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.800]   The first type of co-ownership is called tenancy in common.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.160]   Tenancy in common.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.480]   Now the way I think of tenancy in common
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.240]   is it almost works like shares of stock work
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.800]   in a corporation.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   When you hold property as tenants in common
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.400]   with another person,
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.640]   each person who owns,
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.500]   who's a joint owner in that property,
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.240]   if it's held tenancy in common,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.840]   each person holds a distinct
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.940]   and separate share of the property.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.360]   That share could be any portion.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   It could be 50/50, it could be 25/75,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.080]   doesn't really matter,
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.760]   but each person holds a separate distinct share.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.480]   When the property is sold,
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.440]   each person receives income
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.100]   based upon their share of the property.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.920]   Now in a tenancy in common relationship,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.840]   each person has the right
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.600]   to transfer their ownership interest
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.580]   to someone else without the consent
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.080]   of the other owners.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.500]   And so, my dyslexia kicking in.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.920]   So like shares of stock,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.120]   you can just simply sell them to another person
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.300]   without asking the other partners
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.360]   whether or not they will allow you to sell them.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.920]   So that's the way that tenancy in common works.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.600]   In many cases, tenancy in common
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.320]   is the default way that you have joint ownership.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.020]   It does not include any rights of survivorship.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.900]   It doesn't protect the rights of the other person.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.640]   Each person could just simply sell
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.680]   their portion of a property.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.280]   So it can be useful.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.720]   Let's say that you and I own
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.360]   a piece of real estate together.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.920]   Well, we don't wanna go necessarily,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   we've decided we don't wanna go
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.800]   and establish a corporation or LLC
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.160]   and issue shares of stock or issue membership units
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.360]   in order to designate that percentage of ownership.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.520]   So we just list ourselves
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.700]   as tenants in common in the property.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.760]   I can go and sell my partial interest
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.280]   in the property anytime I want.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.480]   That can be useful.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.700]   You don't have to be beholden to me.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.320]   But the problem is it doesn't help anything
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.280]   with regard to asset protection.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.680]   If you and I own a piece of real estate together
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.400]   and I have a 25% ownership and you have 75% ownership
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.740]   and I have a judgment creditor,
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.920]   that judgment creditor can foreclose,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.040]   force the sale of the property.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.960]   And after the foreclosure sale is held,
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.120]   you'll receive 75% of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.740]   but I'll receive, but my creditors will receive 25%.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.360]   So the tenancy in common ownership structure
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.040]   is not at all helpful with regard to asset protection.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.280]   The next form of joint ownership
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.640]   is called joint tenancy with rights of survivorship.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   And in the case of similar to tenancy in common,
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.280]   in joint ownership, you can have different percentages
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.860]   of people, but the only trick is
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.160]   when one of the tenants dies,
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   the property automatically passes to the other joint owner.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.600]   Now, joint tenancy with rights of survivorship
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.200]   can be extremely useful with regard to estate planning.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.800]   It can be a very simple way of making sure
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.760]   that somebody that you want to receive the property
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.580]   receives it automatically at your death
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.960]   without the property passing through a probate court.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.480]   So it can be very useful for estate planning.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.920]   However, it's not useful for asset protection planning.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.260]   Just like we talked about with tenancy in common,
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.300]   a creditor can attach an asset,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.820]   can foreclose on an asset, can partition an asset,
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.960]   and they can take the ownership of something
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.340]   that's owned with joint tenancy with rights of survivorship,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.340]   just like with tenancy in common,
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.460]   if you wind up owing a creditor.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.280]   And what's worse is for some assets
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.860]   that are easily divisible, like things like bank accounts
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.580]   or stock ownership accounts, things like that,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.800]   in those cases, the way that joint ownership
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.200]   with rights of, joint tenancy with rights of survivorship
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.440]   works, either of the joint tenants
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.360]   can access all of the account.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.400]   So where I frequently see this is,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.360]   let's say you have an elderly parent,
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.720]   and that elderly parent doesn't want to,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.960]   they have a checking account and a stock account,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.840]   and let's say there's $100,000 in there,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   and they don't wish to make that account pass
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.000]   by probate court, set up a will, deal with all that.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   So what they do is they make it joint tenancy
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.200]   with rights of survivorship with one of their children,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.960]   and that child becomes a joint tenant owner of the account.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.000]   Now this can be very simple because when the parent dies,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.920]   the younger child just simply automatically
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.400]   has full ownership of the account.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.600]   But during the time while both partners are alive,
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.900]   both partners can use any amount of the money.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.340]   The parent can spend all the money,
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.380]   and the child can spend all of the money.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.960]   And so because of this, a creditor
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   of either of those people can take all of the money.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.400]   So if the son is a high target,
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.960]   that son is subjected to a lawsuit,
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.060]   winds up with a judgment creditor,
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.760]   all of the mother's assets that are in that account
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.560]   can be taken in order to satisfy the debt.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.640]   The son can say, "Listen, this is not my money.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.440]   "It's my mom's money."
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.600]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.260]   The way the law works, it is the son's money.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.600]   So a safer solution, by the way,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.120]   if you're in that situation,
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.240]   a safer solution would be to title the asset.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.120]   The asset could be simply arranged to pass on
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   through the probate court.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.920]   That's not that big of a deal.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.340]   But a better solution would be to establish
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.860]   a living trust, a revocable living trust,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.600]   title the assets into the revocable living trust,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.720]   make the son the successor beneficiary of the asset,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.440]   and then give the son a durable financial power of attorney
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.360]   so that the son can make any kinds of changes
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.920]   on the account if the parent winds up
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.280]   incapacitated in some way.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.060]   So that would be a better solution that provides protection.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.100]   Now in that situation,
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.480]   back to the asset protection standpoint of it,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.900]   the money that's in the revocable living trust
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.600]   would still be available to the parent's creditors.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.480]   The revocable living trust doesn't protect
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.860]   from the parent's creditors.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.600]   But with regard to the child's creditors,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.660]   I guess I used son and mother,
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.800]   with regard to the son's creditors,
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   now there is no asset that is exposed to the son's creditors
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.580]   'cause the son doesn't own anything.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.760]   The son has a durable power of attorney,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.740]   which means that he has the ability
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.740]   to make changes on the account,
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.120]   but he has to do that as an agent of his mother.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.880]   And then at some point in time,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.920]   he may become a beneficiary of the trust.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.040]   But those are not assets that a creditor can access
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.240]   because they're not any ownership.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.960]   It might be benefits,
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.200]   it might be a beneficial,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.240]   it's not a beneficial interest.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.120]   It might be the future potential of ownership,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.360]   but it's not actually ownership.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.600]   So it's accomplishing the same thing
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.440]   that joint tenancy with rights of survivorship
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.680]   was accomplishing,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.880]   but it's doing it in a much safer way.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.160]   In summary, joint tenancy with rights of survivorship
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.240]   can be useful in estate protection or estate planning.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.800]   It can be useful,
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.320]   although there's some many cases
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.560]   where it winds up hurting you,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.840]   but it'll go, the property,
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.440]   if it's owned joint tenancy with rights of survivorship,
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.720]   it'll go to the joint owner on the person's death.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.040]   That's simple.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.240]   As long as that's not a problem,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.740]   you can use that and it'd be useful,
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.000]   but it doesn't provide any useful asset protection benefits,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.640]   which brings us to the third type of common ownership,
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.720]   which is called tenancy by the entirety.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.040]   Tenancy by the entirety is the type of co-ownership
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.560]   that can have really meaningful benefits
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.760]   with regard to asset protection.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.160]   Tenancy by the entirety is a type of ownership
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.200]   that's only available to a husband and wife,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.920]   and it must, but what it provides
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.880]   is it provides an equal,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.360]   indivisible interest in the property.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.080]   So if my wife and I own a house together,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.360]   each of us is considered to have an equal 100% interest
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.720]   in the property, if it's held as tenancy by the entirety.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   And so because each of us has an equal 100% interest
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.080]   in the property, nothing can be done
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.160]   without the consent of the other spouse.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.100]   So if I own a house and it's owned
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.320]   in a tenancy by the entirety state,
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.280]   which is the big limitation of tenancy by the entirety,
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.260]   it's only allowed in certain states,
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.140]   but if I own a house, TBE,
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.480]   then even if I get sued,
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.300]   and I'm not protected under Homestead Exemption,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.160]   even if I get sued and I lose the lawsuit,
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.520]   because my house has a complete undivided interest
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.360]   in the house, she can still own the property,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.920]   and the property cannot be taken,
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.520]   it cannot be foreclosed on.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.920]   I can't just go over the list of states
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.020]   that provide tenancy by the entirety protection
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.040]   because there are a bunch of wrinkles for every state.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.080]   Some states simply do not allow tenancy by the entireties.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.840]   A few states, for example, California, Connecticut,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.120]   Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada,
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.680]   New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota,
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.980]   South Dakota, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.420]   don't allow tenancy by the entireties.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.840]   Now, the remainder of the states either do allow
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.260]   or allow tenancy by the entireties only for real property
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.800]   or maybe allow tenancy by the entireties,
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.960]   and it's unclear as far as what it actually is,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.240]   because it's not clearly put in place by statute,
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.120]   and the case law is uncertain.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.320]   In addition, there are a number of states
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.960]   that have a bunch of wrinkles with regard
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.440]   to the exact level of protection that's provided
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.320]   by tenancy by the entireties.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.540]   So in summary, if you live in a state
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.160]   that does provide for tenancy by the entireties,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.200]   and if you, of course, you have to be married,
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   so if you and your spouse can actually use this,
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.080]   then it is worth considering, and it is worth pursuing,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.820]   'cause it can be really a useful thing.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.040]   If your state allows tenancy by the entireties
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.480]   for real property, then consider, of course,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.320]   owning property using a joint ownership
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.880]   of tenancy by the entireties.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.520]   However, if your state allows tenancy by the entireties
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.100]   for property in addition to real estate,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.880]   then you should consider it for owning other assets.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.620]   So for example, perhaps you have a business
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.200]   that you are structuring.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.240]   Well, if you title the ownership of the business entity
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.640]   as tenancy by the entireties, it's possible
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.440]   that it can bring an additional level
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.680]   of protection from creditors.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.260]   That can be useful.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.280]   So there are a bunch of rules you need to follow.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.700]   You need to make sure that you consult
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.160]   with somebody knowledgeable to make sure
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.920]   that everything is done.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.600]   Tenancy by the entireties is easy
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.000]   to establish and designate.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.720]   It's just simply a property designation.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.080]   So it can be very, very simple.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.040]   You don't have to write a trust.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.040]   You don't have to pay for legal fees,
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.880]   but you just need to make sure that you think it through
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.240]   and establish it.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.640]   Be, again, be aware that in all these cases,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.160]   you do, of course, face a risk of divorce,
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.660]   and you have to ask yourself the question,
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.400]   am I going to regret this with regard
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.380]   to the potential for divorce?
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.660]   Hopefully the answer is no, but if the answer is yes,
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.460]   or I'm uncertain, or I'm uncertain if what would happen,
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.300]   remember that losing assets by way of divorce
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.240]   is probably much more likely than losing assets
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.900]   by way of a lawsuit.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.920]   Now, next consideration outside of those types
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.140]   of joint ownership, and by way of review,
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.220]   tenancy in common, you can be tenancy in common
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.020]   with anybody.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.880]   You can be joint tenants with rights of survivorship
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.060]   with anybody, but you have to be 50% equal owners,
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.380]   and you can be tenancy by the entireties ownership
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.420]   with your spouse.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:47.140]   But those are just simply ownership designations.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.620]   What if you own an asset in a separate entity?
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.260]   Well, you can do that, and so the types of entities
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.280]   would usually either be a trust, different kinds of trusts,
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.360]   but a trust, or a company of some kind,
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.720]   different kinds of companies.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   Let's talk about trusts.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   In general, personal trusts that are revocable
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.860]   do not provide any kind of asset protection.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.560]   So, that was too strong of a statement.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.400]   Personal revocable trusts, such as many people
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.340]   commonly have and commonly establish to own assets,
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.580]   such as a revocable living trust, usually this is done
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.580]   for estate planning purposes, this type of trust
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.580]   does not provide protection in court for your assets.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:39.880]   It may provide some protection with regard to privacy.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.820]   It may provide some protection with regard to
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.940]   just simply segmenting assets out,
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.020]   so that the ownership is not clear,
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.520]   but it's not gonna provide protection in court.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.800]   The only kind of trust that would actually provide
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.120]   creditor protection in court would be an irrevocable trust,
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.740]   a trust where you've actually transferred assets
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.800]   into the trust, and you cannot receive those assets back.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.560]   Now, there are different ways to do this,
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.680]   and there could be very compelling schemes
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.600]   that you could use that provide you with major benefits
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.880]   in addition to asset protection.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.300]   For example, there are various types of charitable trusts
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.160]   where we could transfer assets into the charitable trust,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.980]   you could receive a stream of income
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.200]   from the charitable trust,
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.260]   and that's an irrevocable transfer,
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.500]   thus meaning that that trust asset is no longer available
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.500]   to the claims of your creditors.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.120]   You could establish assets, put assets into a trust
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.680]   for the benefit of your spouse,
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.240]   for the benefit of your children,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.300]   and the assets in those trusts could be protected
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.320]   from the claims of your creditors.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.800]   Also, it could be protected from the claims
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.880]   of their creditors, which is a very compelling reason
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.600]   for you to consider establishing a trust.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.040]   Trusts can be powerful with regard to asset protection,
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.720]   but in order for them to work,
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.280]   you will have to fully give away the asset,
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   and you cannot retain control over the asset,
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.000]   otherwise it will be available
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.360]   to the claims of your creditors.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.880]   There are a number of different types of trusts
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:17.280]   that are specifically designated for asset protection.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.260]   The most common of these that's fairly current
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.600]   would be called a domestic asset protection trust, a DAPT,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   a domestic asset protection trust.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.900]   And this type of trust has a very interesting,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:36.280]   I think it's very interesting, and it's worth considering.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.000]   A domestic asset protection trust
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.780]   is an irrevocable, self-settled trust
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.680]   that is created and governed and protected
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.840]   under the specific statutes of certain states.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.920]   The way they work is,
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.560]   once you place your assets into the trust,
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.920]   after a certain amount of time,
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.480]   which varies based upon different states,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   the assets are protected indefinitely from future creditors.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.640]   And the reason they're so popular
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.480]   is because they're very simple.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.320]   You don't have to file a separate trust-level tax return.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   All the tax liability stays with the grantor.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.520]   They also don't have gift tax consequences.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.500]   So you can avoid dealing with the gift tax registration.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.120]   They're fairly simple.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.000]   They're fairly affordable to create.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.440]   They're fairly simple to set up, fairly simple to maintain.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.200]   And there is a wide degree of latitude
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.120]   of the things that you can own with them.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.680]   So for example, you can own your personal residence.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.120]   You can put brokerage accounts.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.360]   You can put LLC member interests into a trust.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.600]   And you can coordinate them with other trusts.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.440]   So you can have a domestic asset protection trust
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.600]   that holds an asset.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.800]   And then the domestic asset protection trust itself
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.120]   is held by the revocable living trust that you also operate.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.720]   Now, it's not that they're without any kind of hassle.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.880]   For example, one of the most important things
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.920]   that actually makes it work in and of itself
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.880]   is you have to appoint a third-party trustee
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.740]   to approve any distributions from the trust.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.640]   That's the whole reason why
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.600]   this has asset protection benefits,
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.120]   is you have to appoint a third-party trustee
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.880]   to approve any distributions from the trust.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.840]   And so the idea here is that a trustee
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.000]   won't distribute assets from the trust
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.800]   if you are facing the threat
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.140]   of a creditor seizing your assets.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.480]   So the idea is the trustee looks over at you and says,
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.800]   "Oh, Joshua's being sued,
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.120]   "and there are judgment creditors all around,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:45.960]   "there's sharks in the waters.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.820]   "We're not gonna approve any distributions
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.640]   "out of the trust."
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.840]   That's basically the way that they work.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.780]   Now, are these effective?
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.560]   I read the attorneys arguing about them.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.300]   And the basic thing that I've come up with
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.280]   is they might be effective.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.000]   The attorneys that I have read
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.840]   seem to say that they should work,
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.240]   but they're not as tested as some other things.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.960]   And so time will tell.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.840]   The other one big challenge is
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.040]   that they're not available in every state.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.720]   It's my understanding that there are currently
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.400]   about 15 states that actually have laws
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.080]   regulating domestic asset protection trusts.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   Those 15 states are Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii,
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:36.000]   Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.800]   Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.560]   Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.840]   If you live in one of those states
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   and you own property in those states,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.400]   certainly I think this is worth your considering.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.520]   These trusts are not perfect,
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.720]   but they are at least very much worth considering
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.460]   for those who live in those states.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.920]   If you don't live in one of those states,
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.440]   should you use a domestic asset protection trust?
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.680]   My answer, my guess,
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.980]   not being an asset protection attorney, is probably not.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.360]   The argument in favor of your using
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.280]   a domestic asset protection trust,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.420]   even if you don't live in one of those states, is this,
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.640]   that the idea is, yeah, it might ultimately fail,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.760]   but a state that doesn't have
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.080]   their own domestic asset protection trust legislation
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.600]   isn't saying they're not gonna recognize the trust.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.000]   And you can make a good argument in court
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   that they should protect the trust.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.120]   And at the very least,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.360]   you're making it more expensive to get at the asset.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.040]   And remember, one of the biggest basic concepts
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.080]   of good asset protection planning
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.400]   is you want to make it as expensive and as time-consuming
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.600]   and as difficult as you possibly can
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.360]   for somebody to get at an asset.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.400]   Even if you don't have ironclad legal protection
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.320]   like you might like, if you at least make it more difficult,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.480]   more time-consuming, and more expensive
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.720]   for somebody to find an asset,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.000]   for somebody to lay a claim against the asset
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.360]   and to collect on an asset,
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.000]   you're moved in the right direction.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.340]   That would be the argument in favor
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.600]   of a domestic asset protection trust.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   They're less expensive
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.340]   than an offshore asset protection trust,
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.600]   which is probably the biggest benefit
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.400]   of a domestic asset protection trust
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.620]   instead of an offshore asset protection trust.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.820]   I would tend to think
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.680]   of a domestic asset protection trust, in my understanding,
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:45.080]   for an asset that is physically inside of the United States
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.160]   and is physically located in one of those states,
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.480]   or if I'm domiciled in one of those states
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.160]   that has the legislation.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.200]   So here, I think the best solution would be
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.740]   for something like a personal residence.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.100]   If you live in a state
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:00.380]   that doesn't provide good homestead exemptions,
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.520]   then I think a domestic asset protection trust
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.120]   is worth your considering for something
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.120]   like a personal residence.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.680]   One of the most popular states to consider
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.480]   is for a domestic asset protection trust,
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.640]   if you are gonna try to use the strategy
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.680]   of establishing the trust in another state,
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.440]   but then you living not in that state,
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.360]   would be the state of Utah.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.120]   Utah protects assets,
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.640]   they had new legislation a few years ago,
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.840]   that they protect assets in the trust immediately
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.040]   against future creditors.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.600]   So you can't have a creditor
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.920]   and then put assets in the trust,
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.680]   but assets put into the trust are protected immediately.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.600]   Whereas some other assets,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.980]   some other states don't begin protecting the assets
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.960]   against future creditors
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.000]   until they've been in the trust
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.720]   for a little while, a few years.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.440]   Even assets that are placed in the trust in Utah
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.920]   are protected against existing creditors after two years.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.400]   So that can be helpful as well.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.320]   In Utah, a lawyer can serve as the trustee.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.820]   So it can be much less expensive
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.720]   for you to establish a third-party trustee,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.200]   you just simply pay a flat fee to a lawyer,
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   instead of paying a trust company
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.800]   a percentage of the trust assets.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:12.000]   And one of the downsides of domestic asset protection trusts
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.560]   is they're not bulletproof.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.080]   For example, domestic asset protection trusts
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.000]   often don't protect assets against child support,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   alimony, taxes, or again, pre-existing lawsuits
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.280]   and things that are being claimed.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.120]   One of the benefit of Utah is it clearly establishes
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   there's no tax issues when selling your personal residence.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.020]   So when you put your personal residence
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.160]   into a domestic asset protection trust,
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.280]   that doesn't limit your ability to use the exemption
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.200]   from having of sale,
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.320]   exemption of capital gain
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.480]   from the sale of a personal residence
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.560]   when you put the money into,
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.840]   put the asset into the trust.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.200]   Anything beyond that,
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.840]   I'll let the attorneys argue about.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.040]   I've read their arguments.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.680]   Some people are very persuaded they're strong.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.360]   Some people are persuaded that they're worthless.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.920]   I don't know.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.120]   But I think the best solution
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.640]   for the use of a domestic asset protection trust
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.280]   is for your personal residence,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.400]   if you live in a state
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.880]   that has domestic asset protection trust legislation.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.400]   And the idea is if you live,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.160]   so let's walk through kind of a quick category of strategies
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.640]   for things that you would pursue
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.440]   to protect your personal residence.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.800]   The first very best is to live in a state
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.520]   that provides for you a large amount
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.040]   or hopefully unlimited amount of homestead exemption.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.560]   We talked extensively about that
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.600]   in the series on protecting your homestead
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.000]   or earlier in the series.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.800]   So homestead exemption is thing number one.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.840]   Thing number two,
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.160]   you would consider titling the asset
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.080]   as tenancy by the entirety.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.920]   That's helpful as well.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.400]   So, but that only helps you if you are married
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.800]   and you're living in the house with your spouse.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.520]   So first is homestead exemption.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.840]   Second is tenancy by the entirety.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.440]   With that, some states is perfectly fine.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.840]   That's all you need.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.240]   For example, Florida has unlimited homestead exemption
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.880]   and the default titling for real estate owned by couples
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.600]   is tenancy by the entirety.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.720]   So you don't actually have to specially designate anything
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.960]   in Florida, it's default.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.360]   That's the designation, is tenancy by the entirety.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.160]   From there, you move on to equity stripping.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.320]   And so the concept is make sure that you don't have an asset
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   that's not encumbered with a heavy mortgage
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.640]   or heavy liability.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.520]   Don't have the equity in an unprotected asset.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.040]   You, it would be foolish to live in a state
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.600]   that didn't provide homestead exemption
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.560]   and didn't provide a tenancy by the entirety protection
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.840]   and to own real estate that had a lot of equity in it,
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.040]   but not to have money in other accounts
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.760]   that are more protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.460]   So you wouldn't wanna have a paid off house
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.840]   and no money in a 401k.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.060]   From the perspective of asset protection planning,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.440]   you better off have a house with a heavy mortgage on it
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   and all your money in a 401k.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.840]   'Cause the 401k is practically bulletproof
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.720]   from creditors except for IRS and legal claims,
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.840]   some of the super creditors.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.920]   But it's protected totally from the claims
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.100]   of all other creditors.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.800]   But equity stripping is the next thing.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.760]   Then domestic asset protection trust, I think,
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.900]   comes in to be as the next solution.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.720]   So if you live in a state like Nevada, for example,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.480]   Nevada has domestic asset protection trust legislation.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.600]   Nevada has a homestead exemption of $200,000.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   So they'll protect $200,000 of your interest in a property.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.240]   So if you're buying a high-end residence,
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.920]   you buy a house for a million dollars
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   and you make a big down payment,
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:40.560]   10 or 20%, $200,000, but you put the asset
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.020]   into a domestic asset protection trust,
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.560]   your mortgage in the beginning won't pay down much.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.200]   So all of your equity in the house would be protected
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:52.640]   simply by the homestead exemption of $200,000.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.120]   Now, Nevada domestic asset protection trust
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.520]   provides protection after two years.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.860]   So then from then on, as the mortgage pays down the debt
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:04.480]   on the house, more and more equity is created.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.960]   That equity is protected using
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.880]   the domestic asset protection trust legislation.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.880]   So that can be a useful way of protecting your house
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.540]   for a very long time.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.720]   And if you have a very simple trust,
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.880]   just holds one asset, a personal residence,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.000]   doesn't really have any income,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   then the cost for a trustee to manage it
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.320]   should be really quite simple.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.040]   So if you wanna buy a million dollar house in Nevada,
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.440]   that would be a worthwhile thing to consider.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.560]   Other strategies just to kind of finish our list off
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.080]   on protecting your house.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.920]   Then the next would be titling the house
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.560]   in a low-risk spouse's name for the reasons discussed.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.800]   It's probably less effective
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.120]   than a domestic asset protection trust,
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.160]   but worth considering.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.440]   And then of course, making sure
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.200]   that things are properly insured.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.000]   So those are some useful strategies
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.080]   for a domestic asset protection trust.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.880]   Now there are other kinds of trusts,
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.200]   and in many ways, the other trusts
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.920]   are probably more powerful.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.440]   The big name here would be
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.040]   an offshore asset protection trust.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.440]   That's probably the sexiest sounding,
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.760]   and in many ways, an extremely effective way
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.420]   to protect assets.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.720]   An offshore asset protection trust
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.040]   is created with the goal of asset protection.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.160]   How do you protect a big pot of money?
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.680]   It's an offshore asset protection trust.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.000]   That's the goal for it.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.400]   An offshore asset protection trust
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.880]   is an irrevocable, self-settled trust
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.400]   that lives offshore.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.640]   And it has to live offshore
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.080]   to get the benefits of the foreign jurisdiction.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.100]   Frequently, as you move the assets offshore,
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.100]   the first thing is you start to bring in
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.760]   other governments involved,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.140]   other sets of legislation.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.240]   For the sake of brevity,
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.440]   I'm gonna read you two pages
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.760]   from the ABA Consumer Guide to Asset Protection
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.940]   on an offshore asset protection trust.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.880]   They use foreign asset protection trusts, same thing.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.280]   A foreign asset protection trust
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.840]   is a trust that is set up in an offshore jurisdiction
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.320]   that has enabling trust legislation
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.200]   providing for substantial protection
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.800]   against creditors of the trust store.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.780]   One of the greatest advantages of an FAPT
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.380]   is the fact that, by its very nature,
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.860]   any legal attack against the assets
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.100]   is transferred abroad to a different legal system.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.920]   A foreign trustee is necessary
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.060]   for the efficacy of the FAPT.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.460]   As stated, the biggest advantage in utilizing the FAPT
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.740]   is that assets can be placed offshore
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.580]   beyond the jurisdiction of the US courts.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.600]   Some of the advantages of foreign asset protection trusts
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.220]   are as follows.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.860]   Most foreign jurisdictions do not recognize US judgments.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.100]   This may force a new trial on the merits
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.620]   in the foreign situs country.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.540]   Some foreign situs jurisdictions
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.900]   require a much more difficult burden of proof
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.180]   for a creditor to challenge asset transfers
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.140]   to the foreign asset protection trust.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.460]   Some jurisdictions have a statute of limitations
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.660]   for challenging asset transfers to an FAPT
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.340]   that begins to run on the date of transfer.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.420]   Fees and expenses in litigating in foreign jurisdictions
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.340]   are substantial, thereby serving as a strong deterrent
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.900]   to foreign litigation.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.260]   The foreign asset protection trust
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.100]   minimizes the likelihood of a fraudulent conveyance charge
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.220]   because of the difficulty to a creditor
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.720]   of proceeding against the transferee trustee
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.320]   located in the foreign jurisdiction.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.620]   The foreign asset protection trust provides attachment
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.160]   against assets placed in the offshore structure
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.460]   outside of US jurisdiction.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.940]   The foreign structure makes any type of an injunction
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.980]   against further disposition of assets extremely unlikely.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.660]   The FAPT practically eliminates the possibility
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.200]   of the appointment of a receiver over the transferred assets.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.640]   The foreign structure places the assets in a jurisdiction
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.580]   whose laws are favorable to debtors
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.820]   and hostile to creditors.
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.440]   An offshore trust with at least one US beneficiary
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.020]   is a grantor trust for tax purposes.
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.900]   As a result, the FAPT is a pass-through entity
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.940]   to the grantor, similar to a revocable trust
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.260]   when it comes to tax reporting.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.320]   Transfers to FAPT are normally incomplete gifts.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.260]   Accordingly, the assets are generally included
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.320]   in the grantor's estate for estate tax purposes.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.160]   Most FAPTs provide for the office of a trust protector.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.120]   The third-party protector has the power
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.540]   to remove the trustee and appoint a substitute trustee
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.780]   to change the situs of the trust.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.340]   He or she can also veto any amendments
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.820]   or distributions made by the trust.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.880]   Many times, the protector can be an entity
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.900]   or person not subject to the jurisdiction of a US court.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.140]   Anti-duress provisions make it very difficult
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.380]   for any court order to have any impact on trustee
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.940]   or creditor attacks designed to force distributions
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.100]   from the trust to the creditor.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.300]   To recapitulate, the foreign asset protection trust
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.220]   places assets out of reach of US courts.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.780]   Creditors are required to litigate
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.500]   in offshore jurisdictions, utilizing offshore domicile laws
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.080]   and justice systems rather than the US court process.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.060]   So my summary in short is the offshore asset protection trust
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.540]   is a powerful tool to use to hold assets
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.540]   that does bring substantial creditor protection.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.780]   And I think the key here is first to recognize the downsides.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.060]   The downsides are gonna be significant cost
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.980]   to create properly and to maintain.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.660]   Thus, we really should be talking
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.300]   about a significant amount of assets,
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.820]   right amount of assets to do, I don't know,
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:41.820]   ask an attorney, but for anything less than a million bucks,
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   I gotta guess it's not really worth pursuing.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.300]   So if you've got several millions of dollars
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.540]   that you're considering protecting,
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.780]   I think that it's very much worth having those assets
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.700]   in the offshore trust, but you will have to count the costs.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.180]   There are significant costs
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.580]   to maintaining the offshore trust.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.260]   All of those benefits that you get
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.300]   by putting your trust in the Cook Islands
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.660]   or some other jurisdiction that's well-known
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.020]   for this type of planning,
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.340]   you get a lot of benefits for it, yes,
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:16.980]   but you also have to pay for it.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.580]   The whole industry is propped up
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.140]   by all of the fees that you're gonna be paying,
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.660]   so it's gotta be worth it.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.340]   I think it's very important to make sure you work
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.380]   with a competent attorney that will structure it
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.620]   in the way that's likely to have the most success.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.660]   Offshore asset protection trusts were trumpeted
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:34.020]   by the legal industry for many years as being bulletproof.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.940]   And then there've been a number of cases
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.300]   in which they were proven not to be bulletproof.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.180]   Some people believe that they're not worth pursuing
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.940]   because they're not bulletproof.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.020]   In my layman's reading,
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.100]   I would guess that they're probably still very, very strong,
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.860]   but they need to be structured properly
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.580]   and have the proper provisions brought in.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.180]   And I would add one more thing.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.460]   You, if you are using an offshore asset protection trust,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.780]   you need to think carefully
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.300]   about your own internationalization plan
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.740]   with regard to your assets
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.300]   and also with regard to your person.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:12.220]   If you are physically located in the United States,
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.580]   you personally are vulnerable,
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.460]   no matter where your assets are in the world,
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.460]   you personally are vulnerable to a US-based judge.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.380]   And this is one of the big downsides,
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.740]   one of the big things that has happened
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.020]   with offshore asset protection trusts.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.220]   The ultimate provision against you,
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.460]   if you have an offshore asset protection trust,
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.700]   is that you go into court and you say,
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.620]   "Listen, I can't make this trust give me assets
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.980]   because I'm under claim.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.820]   I don't have the ability to scourge assets from the trust.
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.980]   The trustee does that.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:45.820]   I don't have the ability.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.860]   I can't even get income from the trust
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.620]   because you're under threat of judgment."
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.660]   And so the trust may be paying your credit card bills.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:57.060]   It may be paying your other expenses,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.140]   but it can't give you income.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.300]   So you go in the court and you say,
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.500]   "I can't even have any income from the trust.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.980]   I have no control over it.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.860]   The trustees do it.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.180]   I'm just a beneficiary of the trust
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.500]   and they won't give me any money."
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.380]   I'm simplifying,
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.260]   but that's basically the way the defense works.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.740]   So assets are offshore.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.860]   US courts can't touch them.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.580]   The trustees are offshore.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.020]   The protector is offshore in another jurisdiction.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.460]   US courts have no jurisdiction
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.940]   over the trustees or the protectors.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.580]   Thus, it's completely offshore.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.940]   And yes, they pay my Amex bill, but that's it.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.580]   So you laugh in the judge's face.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.260]   And what the judge does is the judge says,
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.820]   "I don't believe you.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.980]   I'm commanding you to go to prison
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.500]   until you actually go and pay this and pay it.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.100]   And if you can't do it, if you can't pay it,
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.500]   you can't command your trustees to give you money
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.620]   in order to pay this claim
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.580]   that this legitimate creditor has against you.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.780]   You're just gonna sit in prison
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.020]   until you can figure it out."
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.500]   Well, sitting in prison often has a significant effect
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.740]   on many people.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.740]   And they eventually say, "You know what?
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.580]   I'm gonna figure out some way to get my trustees
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.940]   to give me some money so that I can get out of prison."
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.460]   So if you're using an offshore asset protection trust,
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.420]   you need to give thought to the trust,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.980]   but you also need to give thought to yourself.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.900]   Because if you are no longer physically present
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.220]   under the jurisdiction of the US judge,
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.180]   then now your creditor's claims against you
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.620]   are basically unenforceable.
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.620]   If your assets are offshore, and if you are offshore,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:30.340]   then now you have a much stronger case.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.620]   But I think many people
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.220]   who have offshore asset protection trusts
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.940]   have not given much thought to their own plan
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.700]   to be physically offshore in an extreme case,
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.780]   like I just described.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.320]   And I think that's a real mistake.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.100]   The second thing you need to be aware of
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.420]   is that it's possible that if a judge doesn't believe
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.260]   that your offshore asset protection trust is,
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.380]   they don't believe it,
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.040]   they can then now start to lay claim
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.660]   against your other assets in the United States,
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.900]   even if those other assets are considered to be bulletproof.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.740]   So for example, you live in Florida,
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:07.540]   you have a, you live in Florida,
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.540]   you have a $5 million house in Florida,
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.580]   protected under the Homestead Exemption,
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:17.580]   you have $5 million in your 401(k) plan, and that's it.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.980]   You don't have any other assets in the United States.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.100]   You have a $5 million house
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.160]   and a $5 million in your 401(k) plan.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.000]   But you are the beneficiary
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.060]   of an offshore asset protection trust
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.640]   that has $20 million in it.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.700]   And now somebody wins a lawsuit against you for $10 million.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.900]   Well, the judge says,
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.320]   "I want $10 million out of your offshore asset protection
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.460]   trust for you to pay your creditors."
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.560]   You say, "Sorry, judge, I can't get the money out."
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.680]   Well, and you say,
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.440]   "And by the way, you can't do anything against me
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.360]   because I have this house and I have this 401(k)."
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.180]   Well, in that situation,
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:56.060]   it's possible that the creditor and the court may impose,
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:01.940]   let's call it a surcharge, on your other assets.
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.820]   And even if those assets are exempt,
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.820]   the creditor can ask the court to surcharge the assets
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.900]   because they can't collect on the other assets
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.900]   because you've intentionally put those assets
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.940]   offshore outside of the creditor's reach.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:21.840]   So the point is that if your assets are surcharged,
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.360]   now they're not available to you.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.560]   They're not available to you
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.920]   to fund your living expenses, et cetera.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.760]   So the idea that you can just use the offshore trust
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.640]   to protect all the assets that aren't protected
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.600]   by your exempt assets in the United States
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.720]   may be a problem.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.720]   Now, that's not to say it's not without major costs.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.000]   So we're talking here some extreme examples.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.260]   And I'm already going much longer than I expected,
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.460]   but we could look at some of the cases.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.420]   I've read a bunch of articles
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.000]   and dug into a bunch of the cases.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.520]   But some of the cases
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.780]   where the Offshore Asset Protection Trust didn't fail,
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.660]   that's not the right word,
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.300]   but where it didn't work exactly as intended
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.740]   were against just major super creditors.
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   The most famous one is the Arlene Grant case,
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.620]   but against super creditors, and that case was the IRS,
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:14.460]   with just a hugely expensive and time-consuming lawsuit.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.180]   So back to our levels of protection.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.500]   Just because an Offshore Asset Protection Trust
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.780]   may not be ultimately bulletproof against the IRS
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.580]   doesn't mean that it's not potentially helpful for you.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.060]   You have the benefits of the privacy,
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.180]   you have the benefits of massive expense.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.200]   You're just a very, very tough person
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.380]   to take a claim against.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:35.940]   So again, don't let these things say,
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.860]   oh, because it can't have perfection,
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.140]   we're not gonna do anything.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.600]   That's the wrong solution.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.940]   Perfection is probably not possible.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.080]   But if you've given thought to what assets
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.380]   are inside the United States,
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.260]   what assets are outside of the United States,
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.340]   and if you give thought to solving the problem
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.400]   of the location of your physical body,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:57.060]   then you can avoid some of these problems.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.780]   So give thought to that if you are pursuing
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.580]   an Offshore Asset Protection Trust.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.060]   Now, I need to boogie on.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.340]   Let's switch from trust.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.260]   There are other types of trust.
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.940]   We can talk about land trusts.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.240]   Land trusts can be very valuable
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.700]   from a personal privacy standpoint,
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.180]   especially for real estate.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.060]   They're of limited value for asset protection,
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.060]   but they can be integrated with an LLC.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:17.940]   We'll skip that.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.060]   That's only of interest to real estate investors, really.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.380]   So let's talk about business structure,
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.300]   specifically here, corporations
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.380]   and limited liability companies.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.580]   Corporations and limited liability companies
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.140]   are your friends.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.180]   The most important reason they're your friends
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.500]   is the obvious thing, that is, business 101.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.140]   They protect you against liability.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.020]   Yes, I've been speaking in this series fairly freely
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.700]   about how somebody sues you,
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.540]   but at the end of the day,
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.580]   there's gotta be a reason why somebody's gonna sue you.
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.340]   That reason may be much broader than it once was.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.460]   You may be much more likely to be targeted
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.940]   because of your deep pockets,
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.580]   but there has to be a fundamental cause for the lawsuit.
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:04.740]   There has to be a reason, an argument for the case.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.540]   Much of the time, that argument will arise
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.460]   from some activity.
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.540]   And so if you're engaging in activities,
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.780]   business activities, et cetera,
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:17.340]   you can potentially limit your liability
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.020]   based upon running those activities
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.580]   through a proper business entity.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.700]   Now, hear me loud and clear.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.860]   If your company is sued,
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.900]   it is extremely likely that the attorney
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.180]   bringing the lawsuit against you
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.140]   will name you personally as a defendant as well.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.340]   So in any business structure that you do,
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.100]   you better make sure that you're properly managing it.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.260]   You better make sure
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.180]   that you're doing your corporate record keeping,
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.200]   that you're having your annual meetings,
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.900]   that you're doing everything to maintain the corporate veil
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.980]   so that you don't automatically personally become liable.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.860]   But a corporation is absolutely going to provide you
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.560]   with protection, properly maintained,
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.060]   with protection from the liability
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.020]   that can be created by your business activities.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.100]   And so a corporation or an LLC
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:06.900]   can protect the liability from flowing through to you.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.940]   Now, that means that the business itself
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.420]   will have to stand good for the debts.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.980]   So if the business itself is found to be at fault
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.900]   in some problem,
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.820]   then you can expect that the business
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.660]   may go totally bankrupt,
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.780]   but at least it might not cover your other assets.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.620]   So the business is important.
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.540]   In a business, think back to what I mentioned
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.020]   at the first part of the show,
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.660]   that you can use different business entities
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.820]   to segment out risk and liability
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.220]   and to segment out assets.
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.620]   So you can own valuable assets
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.380]   in businesses that have very low liability.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.340]   You can segregate your liability
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:48.220]   into businesses that have very low assets.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.580]   You can do what I talked about.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.300]   You can have an operations company and a holding company.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.060]   You can even do things like making sure
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.020]   that you can have an employee,
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:57.860]   what's it called?
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.620]   An employee leasing company,
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.980]   where you can set up
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.500]   a professional employment organization.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.260]   And a professional employment organization
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.860]   is the organization that actually contracts
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.620]   with all of the employees.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.900]   And then the professional employee organization
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.300]   leases the services of its employees
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.540]   to another company,
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.260]   because one of the biggest liability risks
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:22.180]   for the business is the actions of its employees.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:27.180]   And this liability is potentially massive.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.500]   Some of it is on things
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.980]   that you would think are common sense,
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.820]   such as your employee does something
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.220]   ordinary in the line of business,
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.420]   but does something negligent
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.620]   and causes problems with it.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.140]   But it's far more than that.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:46.740]   One famous story that you read about
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.740]   in the asset protection books
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:52.540]   was where there was a giant stadium concessionaire
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.460]   who sold alcohol to a person
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.580]   who was already inebriated.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.620]   And that person drove home drunk,
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.980]   hit another vehicle,
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.380]   causing a major lifelong injury
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.580]   to the passengers of that other vehicle.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.740]   So in the actual lawsuit that came about,
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.980]   who's the person that got the judgment against them?
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.940]   Was the drunk driver the person with the judgment?
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.420]   No, they didn't have any money.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:16.500]   Why would they get the judgment?
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.340]   The employee who sold the alcohol
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.580]   because they sold it to a person
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.500]   who was already drunk?
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.020]   No, no, no.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.420]   They didn't have any money either.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.580]   The concession company who employed the concessionaire?
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.420]   Yes.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.260]   And in that case,
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.540]   the judgment was for $110 million.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.180]   $110 million.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.900]   So it's possible that you could use
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.580]   some kind of employee,
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.060]   professional employment company
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.660]   to segregate the liability.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.620]   Now, there are many other things that you could do,
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.180]   but it's too specific to individuals.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:49.260]   The basic concept is that corporations,
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.540]   limited liability companies,
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.380]   limited partnerships,
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.700]   limited liability partnerships,
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.980]   and all of their brothers,
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:57.460]   these will help you to segregate risk.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:59.100]   But they can also go the other way.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.300]   See, generally, when we're thinking about asset protection,
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.860]   you're thinking about protecting your assets
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.980]   from the company.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.940]   If I own a company,
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.340]   and then I have risks that I'm subject to
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.220]   because of the activities of the company,
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.220]   I'm thinking about protecting my assets
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.500]   that I own personally.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.260]   Perhaps I own a portfolio of rental real estate assets,
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:23.500]   and I own a company.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.900]   Why don't all my rental properties
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.420]   to be exposed to the claims of a creditor
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.620]   because of my company
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:30.260]   that has nothing to do with the rental properties?
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:33.860]   And so I run the company through a business entity.
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.620]   But business entities,
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.340]   specifically, very importantly, LLCs,
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.620]   can also protect you the other way
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:46.500]   because now you can hold an asset inside of an LLC.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:51.420]   And the LLC itself can actually now be protected
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.980]   from other risks.
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:56.420]   Most importantly, if the LLC,
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:57.780]   and here the LLC,
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.660]   and a limited partnership has a place,
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.700]   but you want some kind of entity
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.860]   that has what's called charging order protection.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.900]   This is the key, a charging order protection entity.
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.980]   There are a number of different kinds of entities
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:16.380]   that can have charging order protection,
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.700]   can be a charging order protected entity.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.180]   Here are the ones that are protected
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.900]   by our charging order protected entity.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.260]   Limited partnership, general partnerships,
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.780]   limited liability partnerships,
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.740]   limited liability, limited partnerships,
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.380]   and limited liability companies.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.860]   Although, remember, it's important
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.780]   with limited liability companies.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.220]   In many jurisdictions,
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:46.260]   only a multi-member limited liability company
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:49.300]   can have charging order protection.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.940]   Now, it's important that you recognize
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:55.940]   a corporation is not a charging order protected entity.
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:01.580]   If a corporate shareholder is attacked by creditors,
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:06.540]   the creditor may seize all of the shares of stock
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.240]   owned by that creditor,
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.300]   up to the amount of the debt, of course.
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:13.420]   And then if the creditor can seize enough shares
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:15.700]   so that they can have control of,
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.580]   at least majority control of the company's voting shares,
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.460]   then the creditor can vote to liquidate the company
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.100]   and disgorge all the assets
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.180]   and then seize all of the assets of the company
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.500]   for the liquidation.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.300]   And this is one of the major things
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.380]   that makes a corporation
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.340]   a pretty poor asset protection vehicle.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.900]   Let's use two simple examples to demonstrate the point.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.860]   Let's say that I own $100,000 worth of shares
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.620]   in Coca-Cola Corporation, and I have a creditor.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:47.540]   Well, my creditor can now, of course, come after me
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.220]   and can take that $100,000 worth of shares
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.940]   of Coca-Cola stock.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.980]   And then they can sell that stock on the open market
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.460]   and in that situation, they can use that $100,000
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.740]   to satisfy their judgment against me.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:04.380]   The fact that Coca-Cola is a corporation
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   protects me as a shareholder from the actions of Coca-Cola,
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.340]   but it does not protect my value of assets
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.100]   from my personal creditors.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:21.580]   So corporations don't protect me and my assets
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.420]   against personal creditors.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.700]   Now, if Coca-Cola, it's fairly simple
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.340]   and it should be obvious, the principle should be obvious.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.540]   But if I have Joshua's Land Clearing Company,
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:37.940]   and Joshua's Land Clearing Company doesn't have any assets
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.100]   except all this equipment,
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.260]   and Joshua owns shares of the stock
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.420]   and I just own it in a corporation,
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:49.020]   well, my creditor can seize all of the shares of stock
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.740]   of my corporation just like they can seize the shares
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.220]   of stock of my Coca-Cola stock, which is also a corporation.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.220]   And if they can seize value up to at least 50%
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:04.540]   of the voting share so that they can control my company,
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.660]   now they control the company,
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.220]   they can hold a board of directors meeting,
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.580]   they can vote to liquidate the company
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.620]   to sell all the assets on the open market
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.900]   and they could take my bulldozers and my semi trucks,
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.900]   they can sell them all, turn them into cash
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.980]   and use that cash to satisfy the judgment
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:24.620]   that they have gotten against me.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.980]   So that is the problem with a corporation
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:31.740]   for the purposes of asset protection.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.820]   So what's the solution?
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.020]   Well, the solution is what's called the charging order.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:40.380]   And the charging order is built into the law
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.180]   that most states have adopted,
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:47.180]   the various sample laws, the recommended laws
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.780]   that most states have established,
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.780]   which governs and limits a creditor
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.500]   of a company's partner or owner,
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.580]   limits the ability of a creditor to access assets
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.300]   that are in excess of company distributions
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.540]   to the individual.
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.580]   And so generally the only remedy
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.380]   that's available to a creditor
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:13.180]   is the creditor can attach things
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.940]   that are actually distributed to me.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.820]   And so think about this,
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:19.300]   let's say that you and I are in a partnership together,
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.020]   limited partnership.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.140]   If we're doing business together
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.740]   and I have creditors that can come
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.620]   and can destroy the business
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.260]   and force the business to be closed
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.900]   and all the assets to be disgorged
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.340]   and sold at a foreclosure auction
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.940]   or sold at auction, whatever,
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.060]   that could really harm you.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.740]   And so to protect you,
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.180]   what my creditor is going to be limited to
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.300]   is a charging order.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.340]   And they'll only be able to access
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.780]   to actual distributions.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.700]   So you and I can continue in business together
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.740]   and our limited partnership
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.860]   sends out $100,000 of income to you
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.900]   and sends out $100,000 of income to me,
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:01.220]   that $100,000 is going to be available to my creditors.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.740]   Now what's even more important though
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:06.820]   is a charging order holder cannot control the entity.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.780]   And thus they cannot control
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.500]   when distributions are actually made.
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.620]   So if the entity itself never makes a distribution
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.060]   to the partner that owes money,
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.500]   then no money is available here
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.740]   to the creditor.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.220]   Now it would be not a good idea whatsoever
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.500]   to give a distribution to every partner
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.100]   except the partner that has a creditor.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:35.980]   I think that would be thrown out by a judge,
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.780]   which is not a good situation.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.740]   But it does provide a very important tool
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.820]   that we can use for asset protection.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.940]   So by using a charging order protection entity,
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.180]   we can limit the ability of a creditor
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.100]   to attack the assets that are held
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.340]   in that charging order protected entity.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:58.060]   But this is why it's so important
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.020]   that whenever you establish an entity,
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.820]   that you make sure that there are multiple people involved.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.460]   Because in the same way that you can have
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:09.300]   a court pierce the corporate veil and say,
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.540]   "No, we're going to allow the owner's assets
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.420]   "to be available to the claims of the company,"
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.660]   if the company is not structured properly,
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:20.740]   you can have a reverse piercing of the corporate veil
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.300]   or reverse piercing of the entity.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:27.460]   So in this case, if I own an LLC,
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.220]   and it's a single member LLC,
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.460]   and I own the asset and I own a business inside of that,
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:35.700]   but I now have a creditor that's available to me,
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.980]   let's say I have an LLC, it owns an investment property,
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.140]   but I have a creditor now that's a personal creditor,
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.940]   and the judge says, "You need to pay this debt,"
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.740]   and then they look at this LLC that I own,
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.820]   and I say, "Look, it's an LLC,
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.420]   "you can't do anything with it."
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.020]   Well, they look down at it and say,
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.220]   "No, you're the only beneficiary of this LLC,
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:54.020]   "so we're just going to give the control of the LLC
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.420]   "over to the creditor, the real estate's gonna be sold,
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.540]   "and then that sale of assets
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.560]   "is gonna be used to satisfy the debt."
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.400]   So you gotta make sure
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.660]   that there are multiple people involved
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.980]   and so that you properly make sure
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.340]   that you wouldn't be the only one harmed
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.220]   if the assets were sold out of the entity.
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.860]   Now, you can see here why we're getting to the end
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:16.820]   of our Asset Protection for Marimortals series.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.280]   You're gonna need some advice,
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.020]   because only a handful of states
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:25.980]   have charging order protection available for LLCs.
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:29.780]   Most states have it available through a limited partnership,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:32.180]   so depending on what you're trying to accomplish,
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.020]   you can do this,
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.340]   you can create a family limited partnership,
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.620]   you can create a family limited liability company,
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.220]   and you can use these entities
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.260]   to protect what you're doing.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:46.260]   And one of the most valuable things about LLCs especially
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.900]   is they're so flexible in terms of the assets
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.100]   that they can own.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.980]   So you can start to layer these things together,
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.500]   and you can mix and match almost anything.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.540]   You gotta be careful with S-corporations.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.340]   An S-corporation can own an LLC,
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.140]   and it's technically possible,
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.860]   if you have a single-member LLC,
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.180]   it's sometimes possible that a single-member LLC
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.660]   could own shares of an S-corporation,
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.060]   but you get into problems if you have multi-member LLC.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.460]   So you can have an,
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.940]   your S, an S-corporation can own an LLC.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:20.500]   But if you just simply talk about a standard C-corporation,
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.700]   a corporation can issue a corporate stock,
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:25.880]   and an LLC can own shares of corporate stock,
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.140]   and a corporation can own an LLC.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.540]   So you can mix and match these things together
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.420]   to protect what you're trying to do.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.580]   So let's say that you have a corporation,
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.220]   what should you do if you have a corporation
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.380]   and you're worried about protecting
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.220]   the corporate stock that you own?
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.900]   Well, bringing together some of these things
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.300]   that we talked about.
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:46.560]   Married couples can make sure that the corporate stock
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.460]   is owned by the less vulnerable spouse.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:52.900]   That could be a good solution.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.980]   It's tax neutral, it's not perfect,
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.900]   especially if it's a transfer.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.000]   Could be subject to a fraudulent transfer ruling,
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.220]   but that's possible.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:04.780]   You can transfer the shares of corporate stock,
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.580]   as long as it's not an S-corporation,
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.460]   S can be tricky, it can be done in some permutations,
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.180]   but so we're sticking with C-corp.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.540]   You can transfer the shares of corporate stock
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:18.100]   to an LLC or to a limited partnership.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:20.220]   And of course that LLC or limited partnership
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.460]   could be domiciled in the US,
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.100]   it could be domiciled offshore.
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.180]   As a capital contribution, that's a tax-free event.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:30.620]   Now you can protect that stock because it can't be sold,
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.940]   'cause now it can't be seized by a creditor,
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.060]   and it's now an asset of the LLC.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:39.820]   In addition, you can stay on as the manager of the LLC
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:40.940]   or the limited partnership,
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.920]   so you can then control your corporate stock
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.860]   because you're the manager of the LLC,
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.180]   even if you're not receiving distributions from the LLC.
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.220]   It's possible that you can also remain a director
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.460]   or an officer of the corporation.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.700]   So just because your stock is held by the LLC
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.200]   of the manager, as long as you follow things properly
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.540]   with regard to the tax planning there,
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:04.380]   you can still control the underlying corporation.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.660]   You can move the corporate stock into an irrevocable trust.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.220]   That can be set up for your children,
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.900]   other family members, other beneficiaries,
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.360]   a charitable trust can work.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.820]   You can title your shares as tenancy by the entirety.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:20.560]   So if you are in a state that allows non-real property
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.700]   to be protected by tenancy by the entirety,
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:25.860]   now that can provide significant benefits as well.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.460]   So there are other benefits as well,
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:31.620]   where you can assess the share, issue proxies,
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.380]   or dilute your ownership, and some other things as well.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.380]   But LLCs give you tremendous flexibility.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:42.220]   Let me finish up with regard to entities.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.140]   I've talked about a number.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.540]   I just want to also point out to you
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.780]   that you can use some of those entities previously discussed
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:52.540]   such as IRAs to hold assets as well.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:55.420]   So you can have a self-directed IRA,
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.780]   you can have a self-directed 401(k),
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.860]   you can have a self-directed ESA,
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.440]   educational savings account,
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.860]   you can have a self-directed HSA, health savings account.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.980]   You can create a checkbook LLC,
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:09.260]   you can do your investing through those entities,
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:11.580]   and you can maintain the asset protection benefits
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.220]   of those asset entities,
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.380]   also the tax benefits of those entities,
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.260]   and still use it to own and control your investments.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.580]   So there are a lot of benefits,
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.300]   things that you could pursue there with your IRA.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.140]   With all of these different strategies,
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.180]   we've discussed a long range,
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:30.760]   and I guess I just should finish up with nominees.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.340]   With nominees, other people that you trust
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.380]   just simply owning certain assets,
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.060]   doing certain things for you,
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.580]   some of that activity could be illegal
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:42.820]   if you did it wrongly,
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.060]   and you did not discuss it properly,
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.460]   and disclose things properly,
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.100]   or it could be completely legal
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.300]   and provide benefits for you of privacy
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.180]   and other things as well.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.620]   Your risk, of course, with working with a nominee,
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:57.800]   somebody that you are asking to do certain things for you
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.140]   under their name, is of course, they're the owner.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.900]   So you have no legal rights.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.340]   But in a situation where you have
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.620]   strong relationship connections,
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.140]   that if you trust the relationship and trust the person,
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.140]   then working with a nominee can be helpful as well.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.740]   With all of these options that we've talked about,
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:16.060]   you can look at almost any asset,
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:20.680]   and you can find an intelligent way to hold that asset.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.300]   In almost every circumstance,
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:26.320]   maybe that's too strong,
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.140]   it's very hard for me to come up with an asset
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.900]   that should be owned by a person
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.660]   individually just in their name.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.460]   The best asset for this type of thing
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.140]   is an asset that doesn't have
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.060]   any kind of ownership claim except possession.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.460]   So when we talked about physical property,
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:46.460]   one of the major benefits of physical property
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.540]   is there's no titling to it.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.620]   There's no titling to gold coins.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.180]   There's no titling to cash.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:57.020]   There's no titling to a valuable,
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.960]   you know, a Stradivarius violin.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   There's no titling to a valuable gun collection.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.420]   These are just things that possession simply means ownership.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.660]   And so with that,
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:13.460]   you have significant, massive levels of privacy.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:16.020]   And as long as those assets are physically secured
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.660]   and are physically diversified,
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.460]   you have tremendous privacy.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:23.900]   That privacy buys you major benefits on the front end.
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.700]   It makes you a smaller target.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.100]   It makes you harder to locate.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.000]   It makes you less likely to be sued.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.120]   You don't have, with that ownership structure,
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.180]   you don't have legal protection
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.000]   when you actually have to make a statement of assets
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.440]   for your creditor if you lose a lawsuit.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.640]   That's unlikely.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.460]   In all these strategies, that's a pretty good one.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.760]   So you can own assets personally in that situation
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.160]   of just because they're,
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.880]   and you get benefits from the privacy.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.240]   Now with almost everything else,
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.000]   anything that has a record
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.320]   is going to be exposed to the public view.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.860]   And so in this situation,
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:01.860]   you now have a space where privacy is extremely important.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.360]   And that privacy can be the only benefit
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.720]   that comes from an entity itself.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.120]   With, and the specific strategy
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.360]   would vary based upon the asset.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.040]   Let's say that you purchase an RV.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.560]   With an RV, there's no reason whatsoever
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.480]   other than perfect, I shouldn't say no reason.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.000]   The only reason that I can think of
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.120]   to own something like an RV personally
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.480]   would be just the simplicity
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.060]   and the total elimination of cost.
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.820]   But if you go and buy something like an RV,
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.060]   here I'm thinking of a trailer is the simplest thing
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.280]   because it doesn't even have to be insured.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.600]   Although you can insure something that's owned by it,
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.480]   it's not a big deal.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.700]   You can do it with cars, do it with anything.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.680]   But you go and you buy an RV.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.720]   Well, put the RV into an LLC.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.880]   Establish an anonymous LLC
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.000]   in one of the states that provides for such things.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.200]   Cost you a few hundred bucks to establish.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.600]   And you have a director that runs the LLC.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.400]   You can own the RV there.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.760]   You can insure it in the LLC.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.280]   It's not a problem whatsoever.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.520]   And now you've disconnected yourself
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.360]   from the ownership of that RV.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   Now in this situation, LLC is disregarded.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.920]   No tax situations whatsoever.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.800]   Plus you're gonna lose money on it in any way.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.660]   But you at least get the benefits of privacy
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.240]   by establishing an entity.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.280]   So you just should do the same thing with your cars,
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.040]   with your boats, with your RVs, et cetera.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.960]   And even if those assets do not give you asset protection,
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.040]   the privacy in and of itself
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.020]   gives you a measure of protection.
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:35.400]   Now you can step it up another step.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.180]   You can hold those LLC member units
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.960]   within some other entity.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.520]   Could be a trust.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.840]   You could hold them.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.740]   You could just simply hold them with other people
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.240]   to get charging order protection with them
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.640]   if your state provides that for LLC.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.680]   The point is the privacy is one thing.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.720]   And then you can add in the actual legal protection as well.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.440]   With things like your house,
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:02.040]   you can fairly easily use a common thing
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.380]   of a revocable trust.
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:06.560]   You can set it up with just a personal revocable trust.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.160]   And now you can start to gain potentially some benefits
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.120]   for the privacy of the ownership of the house,
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.920]   depending on what you call that trust.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.240]   But yet you can still,
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   depending on the laws of your state,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.960]   you can still benefit from your homestead exemption.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.920]   You can still get your tenancy by the entireties.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.800]   You can still benefit from all of those things,
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.240]   even though you provide some shield with a personal trust.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.520]   As long as you don't have income,
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.500]   you have a fairly easy time
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.560]   of titling almost any of these assets
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:38.080]   and maintaining privacy as a major consideration.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.320]   The thing that always breaks you
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.840]   is when you start to have income,
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.440]   because now you'll very quickly lose privacy.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.380]   When you start opening bank accounts,
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.440]   when you start,
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   insurance has a place,
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.960]   although that's a modest privacy risk.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.360]   But anytime you start having income,
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.200]   then you start to have more significant,
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.580]   you lose privacy.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.440]   It's very hard to have income and maintain privacy.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.740]   Really the only way to do it completely,
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:03.540]   I'm not gonna tell you, it's too hard.
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:09.520]   So with assets that aren't income producing,
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   a few hundred dollars,
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.680]   you can hold most of those assets
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.880]   at least privacy, privately.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.280]   And now you start to look like a smaller fish.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.400]   If you drive a company car,
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:23.240]   your boats and such are owned in anonymous LLCs,
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.720]   your house is owned in a trust,
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.220]   you just, you start to come down underneath the radar.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.800]   Then you start to bring in
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.840]   the more robust asset protection
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.980]   for your business assets
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:37.000]   and your trust that you use,
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.920]   whether it's domestic asset protection trust,
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.020]   whether it's to hold LLC units for rental properties.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:46.000]   I'm trying, without trying to show you exactly
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.480]   how every asset should be owned,
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.040]   'cause how could I ever do that?
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.560]   Just trying to stimulate your thinking
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.560]   and to show you how all of these things can come together.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.200]   Now, this is complex
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.360]   because we're thinking about asset protection,
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.600]   but we're also thinking about taxes,
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.680]   but we're also thinking about estate planning.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.740]   And there are so many moving parts,
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:11.380]   it can be very, very complex.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.340]   But here's my summary statement.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.960]   For people with assets,
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.700]   it's hard for me to think why any asset should be titled
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:20.880]   in your personal name,
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.280]   other than something that's trivial
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.880]   or a minor asset that's for the sake of convenience.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:32.720]   There is a spectrum of cost and complexity.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.720]   And I don't think that everybody should have
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:39.800]   the most expensive, most complex situation,
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.420]   but you can establish things
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:45.040]   so that they fairly simply start to grow with you.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:50.040]   And once you get used to creating LLCs
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.480]   or having them created for you,
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.200]   once you get used to managing
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.800]   the corporate formalities of an entity,
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.780]   then you can start to figure out
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:01.240]   what your personal level of comfort is
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.920]   for the administrative complexity,
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.280]   and you can systematically protect your assets step by step.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.040]   There are probably solutions that are, in theory,
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.340]   legally perfect.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:17.100]   But even if you don't arrive at legally perfect,
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.600]   you'll gain major benefits
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.460]   by just being a tougher person to sue.
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.520]   You'll gain major benefits by being thornier, pricklier,
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.960]   harder to pin down, harder to find,
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.040]   harder to figure out what you own,
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:33.460]   and that in and of itself will have value.
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.840]   I would encourage you, dig into some of this stuff.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.500]   Get some asset protection books.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.140]   Just start reading about it.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:41.260]   Think about your own assets.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:43.980]   It's probably fairly simple for most people.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.220]   For most people, your biggest asset that's exposed
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.640]   is probably going to be your house
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.360]   and the equity in your house.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.640]   So we talked about that in this show.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.580]   Homestead exemption, tenancy by the entireties,
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.680]   if available in your state.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.100]   Homestead exemption, based on the laws of your state.
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:03.740]   Strip the equity out, keep mortgage on your house.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.920]   Mortgage money on your house
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.660]   is probably the cheapest money that's available,
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.600]   and it does a good job.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.180]   Now there are fancy ways to equity strip your assets,
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.860]   but a mortgage on your house is probably simple enough.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.620]   Consider a domestic asset protection trust,
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.020]   especially if you're in one of the states that allows it.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.120]   Consider titling the house into the name
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.580]   of a low-risk spouse,
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:23.820]   and then make sure that you have
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.460]   umbrella insurance on your house.
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:29.020]   So there's a fairly simple action plan for your house.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:32.700]   Your 401ks, IRAs, et cetera,
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.980]   those have built-in protection.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.940]   So those things are well covered.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:40.320]   What about for rental properties?
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.520]   Oh, I think you need to have a combination of LLCs.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.840]   Make sure that you have some LLCs
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.360]   that have charging order protection on them,
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.960]   and then you would consider how those interact
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.840]   with possibly a land trust.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.480]   But I think LLCs are your simple low-hanging fruit.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.800]   What about your investment accounts?
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.440]   Well, investment accounts,
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.160]   you could possibly own investment accounts
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.800]   in a domestic asset protection trust.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.280]   You could put them into an LLC
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.940]   that has charging order protection.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.460]   You could move them offshore
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:11.400]   into an offshore asset protection trust
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.040]   if offshoring is part of your plan.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.040]   Beyond that, it just grows from there,
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.140]   but it's the same basic tools figured out
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.300]   how to be applied to your situation.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.900]   Unless you get on top of asset titling,
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.040]   I don't think that,
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.860]   well, I think it's a major solution
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.320]   that you need to dig into.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.340]   Hope this wasn't too deep.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.780]   I hope it was useful to you as I go.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:39.340]   I will give you a quick ad for my course
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.140]   on how to survive and thrive
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:45.180]   during the coming economic crisis.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.620]   And in that course, it's funny,
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.020]   one of the reasons I was talking about,
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:53.420]   much of that course was focused on international relocation
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.580]   during a time of financial crisis, not exclusively.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.400]   And in fact, I give major warnings
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.460]   against international relocation.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:04.740]   But I did an extensive segment in that particular course
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:07.520]   on why international relocation
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.120]   solves some significant problems for you
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.940]   with regard to creditors.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:14.860]   And I even have alluded to that in this particular course.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:18.100]   It's an extensive series on your removing yourself
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.200]   from your home government jurisdiction,
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.460]   probably the United States or wherever it is,
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:27.660]   because that can solve many of your major creditor problems.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.860]   If you are exposed to the claims of creditors,
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:33.100]   and those claims are significant, et cetera,
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:36.060]   with your offshore asset protection planning,
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:38.460]   your offshore asset protection trust,
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.540]   you should have serious consideration
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:43.720]   given to the offshoring of your person
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.660]   to get your person out of the way of legal jeopardy.
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.100]   If you're interested in a lot of ideas
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.540]   and discussion on that, some pretty cool stuff
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.020]   that's very doable,
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.180]   come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.140]   and sign up for the "How to Survive and Thrive
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.780]   During the Coming Economic Crisis."
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:03.060]   In that course, we talk about crossing international borders.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.340]   We talk about forms of identification.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.660]   We talk about crossing international borders surreptitiously,
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.380]   doing it quietly without necessarily passing immediately
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.700]   through immigration control.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.160]   We talk about second passports.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.640]   We talk about residencies,
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.380]   so that if you needed a place to go
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:19.040]   that was different from where you live,
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.260]   what would you do right now
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.020]   if you needed to leave the United States?
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.060]   And all of a sudden,
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:26.500]   you're potentially subjected to ruinous claims.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.140]   Let's assume that the claims of your creditors
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:29.580]   are totally immoral.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:33.420]   Thus, you are morally justified in avoiding them.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.260]   Where would you go?
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.300]   How would you get there?
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.020]   And how would you make sure that you had money to spend
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.540]   if things were,
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.700]   how would you make sure you had money to spend?
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:45.380]   We don't often talk about running away from creditors
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:49.180]   as one of the reasons why you would have to bug out
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.920]   and get out of the United States.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.380]   But yet, it's an entirely valid risk.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.420]   And if you go around the world
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:56.460]   and you talk to many people who have left,
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.060]   you'll find that escaping from creditors
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:03.380]   was often one of the major situations.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:05.540]   And I wanna be very clear.
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.260]   I try to do my best to be morally clear.
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.980]   I always advocate for paying debts.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:14.300]   There are debts that are not moral,
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:16.340]   that legal but not moral.
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.820]   But even if a debt is both moral and legal,
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:22.100]   sometimes in that situation, you still have to get out.
[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:23.340]   What would you do if the United States
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.540]   were in a financial crisis
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:27.260]   and you couldn't make it there
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.660]   and thus you can't earn enough money
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:30.500]   to support yourself and pay your debts
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:31.700]   and you need to get out?
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:35.900]   Well, frankly, if I lived in Des Moines, Iowa
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:39.220]   and I had a major financial problem,
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:42.340]   I were just totally dying, I couldn't make it anymore,
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.480]   I would probably leave.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.020]   I'd move to Chiang Mai, Thailand
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.240]   and I'd start some new business online
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.900]   or start some new service
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.780]   where I can live on less than $1,000 a month
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:54.260]   and be in a tropical beach
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:57.340]   and be around a community of tons of expats, et cetera.
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:58.860]   So I'd go live in Chiang Mai, Thailand,
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.860]   live on the cheap and start a new business.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.220]   Then I'd save the money from that
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.460]   and when I had the money, I would call up my creditors
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:05.820]   and I would say, "Listen, I got some money.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:08.900]   "I'd like to come and pay you off and do it."
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:11.300]   So you have to be competent
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.300]   with all of the things that you can do
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.680]   and the tools and techniques
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.700]   so that you can do what is morally right in that situation.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.580]   Hope you've enjoyed the show.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:20.820]   If you're interested in more details on it,

[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.620]   come on by and give it a try.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.660]   Thank you.
