And at the very least, you're making it more expensive to get at the asset. And remember, one of the biggest basic concepts of good asset protection planning is you want to make it as expensive and as time-consuming and as difficult as you possibly can for somebody to get at an asset. Even if you don't have ironclad legal protection like you might like, if you at least can get at an asset, then you're making it more expensive to get at an asset.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:50.780]   It's not just about the asset. It's about the asset itself. And if you make it more difficult, more time-consuming, and more expensive for somebody to find an asset, for somebody to lay a claim against the asset and to collect on an asset, you're moved in the right direction. That would be the argument in favor of a domestic asset protection trust. They're less expensive than an offshore asset protection trust, which is probably the biggest benefit of a domestic asset protection trust instead of an offshore asset protection trust.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:50.780]   But if you make it more difficult, more time-consuming, and more expensive, then you're making it as time-consuming, and more expensive. You're making it more difficult to get at the asset, and more expensive to get at the asset, and more expensive to get at the asset, and more expensive to get at the asset, and more expensive to get at the asset, and more expensive to get at the asset.

[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.060]   So,
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:52.060]   So,
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.060]   Homestead exemption is thing number one.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.060]   Homestead exemption is thing number one.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.060]   Thing number two,
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.060]   Thing number two, you would consider titling the asset as tenancy by the entirety.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.060]   That's helpful as well.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.060]   That's helpful as well.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.060]   So,
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   So, but that only helps you if you are married and you're living in the house with your spouse.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   So,
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   So, first is homestead exemption.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.060]   So, first is homestead exemption.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.060]   Second is tenancy by the entirety.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.060]   With that,
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.060]   With that,
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.060]   some states is perfectly fine.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.060]   Some states is perfectly fine.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   That's all you need.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.060]   For example,
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:16.060]   For example,
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:21.060]   Florida has unlimited homestead exemption and the default titling for real estate only has unlimited homestead exemption.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:21.060]   For example,

[00:56:45.260 --> 00:57:14.860]   thing to consider. Other strategies just to kind of finish our list off on protecting your house. Then the next would be titling the house in a low-risk spouseï¿½s name for the reasons discussed. Itï¿½s probably less effective than a domestic asset protection trust but worth considering. And then of course making sure that things are properly insured. So those are some useful strategies for a domestic asset protection trust. Now there are other kinds of trusts. And in many ways the other trusts are probably
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:44.480]  . The big name here would be an offshore asset protection trust. Thatï¿½s probably the sexiest sounding and in many ways an extremely effective way to protect assets. An offshore asset protection trust is created with the goal of asset protection. How do you protect a big pot of money? Itï¿½s an offshore asset protection trust. Thatï¿½s the goal for it. An offshore asset protection
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:58:14.100]  , a self-settled trust that lives offshore. And it has to live offshore to get the benefits of the foreign jurisdiction. Frequently as you move the assets offshore, the first thing is you start to bring in other governments involved, other sets of legislation.

[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.540]   Fees and expenses in litigating in foreign jurisdictions are substantial, thereby serving as a strong deterrent to foreign litigation. The foreign asset protection trust minimizes the likelihood of a fraudulent conveyance charge because of the difficulty to a creditor of proceeding against the transferee trust.
