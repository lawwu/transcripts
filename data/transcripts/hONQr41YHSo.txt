[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.280]   >> John C. Bogle was one of the most influential
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.640]   and outspoken figures in the investment management industry
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000]   over the past half century.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200]   [ Music ]
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.360]   Born in Montclair, New Jersey in 1929, Mr. Bogle graduated
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   from Princeton University in 1951,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.480]   before joining Wellington Management Company.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.760]   He rose through the ranks,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.960]   eventually becoming Wellington's chief executive.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280]   But in 1974, he was, in his words,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.800]   "fired with enthusiasm from Wellington, after a merger
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.200]   with another firm went sour."
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.960]   Mr. Bogle then came up with a novel idea.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.680]   He proposed a new kind of mutual fund company,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.240]   one owned by the funds it would serve,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.560]   so it could be entirely client-focused.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.280]   >> I decided that there ought to be a better way
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480]   to run a fund business, and persuaded the directors
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.400]   of the Wellington Fund, and the Windsor Fund,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.120]   and the other funds to start a new structure
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.760]   in which the funds were in the driver's seat,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.840]   and not the management company.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.760]   >> Wellington's funds agreed to the arrangement,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.680]   and the result was the formation of the Vanguard Group,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.520]   a company that dramatically altered the
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.320]   investment landscape.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   With Mr. Bogle at the helm, Vanguard opened for business
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.680]   in 1975, with only $1.8 billion in assets under management.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   A year later, Vanguard launched the first index mutual fund.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.920]   Ridiculed at first for trying only to track the market,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.320]   instead of beating it, Vanguard 500 Index Fund proved
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.440]   to be a landmark offering.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.120]   It took several decades, but the fund demonstrated the merits
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.640]   of indexing, and unleashed a tidal wave
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.000]   of money into low-cost index funds.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.680]   Vanguard's zeal for lowering the cost of investing,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.720]   a cause that Mr. Bogle promoted relentlessly for the rest
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.120]   of his life, has been reflected in all its funds,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.760]   both indexed and actively managed.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.640]   From the start, Vanguard funds had costs
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.040]   that were among the lowest in the business,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.200]   a feature that steadily attracted new investors,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.760]   and helped make Vanguard one
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.600]   of the largest asset managers in the world.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.000]   Such cost consciousness had a profound impact,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.040]   as competitors scrambled to lower their costs,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.240]   and offer their own index funds.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.480]   >> I mean, I hope I'm going to be around here for another 30 years,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.240]   because they're going to write books about Vanguard 30 years
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.840]   from now saying, "Here's the company that changed the industry
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.720]   and made it a better place to invest."
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440]   Of that, I have no doubt.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.720]   >> John Bogle was also a fierce and lifelong advocate
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.800]   for the average investor.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   He promoted the highest standards of ethics,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.200]   especially as scandals
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.760]   and market crises periodically rocked Wall Street.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.080]   His unrelenting criticism of profiteering, self-dealing,
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.600]   and poor stewardship eventually earned him the admiration
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.320]   and praise of investors around the world.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.600]   He received a long list of honors,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.240]   including Fortune magazines naming him one
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.360]   of the investment industry's four giants of the 20th century.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.960]   >> Idealism is everything.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.040]   Sure, it's difficult to measure up to high ideals,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.360]   but just to have them there as your goal,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.240]   knowing that you can never measure up to them, is worthwhile.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.160]   >> After leading Vanguard for more than two decades,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.760]   Mr. Bogle retired from the Vanguard Board of Directors in 1999.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.560]   He then formed the Bogle Financial Markets Research Center.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.240]   A prolific writer and an eloquent speaker,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.640]   Mr. Bogle wrote numerous books and scores of articles and speeches.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.360]   Despite having survived multiple heart attacks
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   and a heart transplant, he kept up a busy schedule
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.120]   of public appearances.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.280]   Mr. Bogle also continued his lifelong commitment
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.320]   to philanthropy and served in a variety of civic roles,
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.200]   including as the first chairman
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   of the National Constitution Center.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.960]   >> I don't know what the future holds.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.400]   I'm going to guess now.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.600]   I won't be around then, but the people will really be saying,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   "He made a difference in this industry.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.760]   "This one man, one person, this one person made a difference.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.880]   "Even one person can make a difference."

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and I am pleased to have on the screen with us
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Mr. Mel Lindauer.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Mr. Mel Lindauer was dubbed by Jack Bogle
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   to be the Prince of the Bogle Heads.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   He was one of the two founders of the Bogle Heads Forum.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   He and Taylor Larimore were the two founding members
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   of this community which has grown to what you see today.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Together they have well over 100,000 posts
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   on bogleheads.org
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and continue in their efforts to moderate that panel.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And other things that Mel has done--
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   he is a Marine veteran, Semper Fi fell, Mel.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He started investing in the late 1960s,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and that was his first experience
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   with bull and bear markets.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   He is the founder of these meetings,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   the Bogle Head Conferences,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   which he is going to talk about a little bit tonight.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   He's been quoted in every financial newspaper there is.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   He is the author of "The Bogle Heads Guide to Investing."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   He is the former CEO
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   of a successful graphics company in Philadelphia.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   He earned the title of Certified Fund Specialist
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   from the Institute of Business and Finance,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   as well as a Wealth Management Specialist
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   from Kaplan University.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   He holds a commercial pilot's license,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and something that I know Mel is very proud of--
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   he was commissioned a Kentucky colonel
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   by the governors of his former state of Kentucky.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So please welcome Mel Lindauer.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   You have the floor, Mel.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Sorry that I can't be with you in person,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   but I'm glad that I can still be with you virtually.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I was asked to talk a little about the genesis
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   of these Bogle Head Conferences
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   and my involvement with the Bogle Heads.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   So here's a bit of that history from my perspective.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   After a couple years of spending the winters in Florida
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   as a snowbird and taking time off work to play golf,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I knew that I was ready to retire early
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and turn the business over to my two sons.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   So in 1997, I pulled the plug
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and headed off into retired life.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Having kept busy all my life,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I knew that I wanted to do something meaningful
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   besides playing golf and walking on the beach,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   so I looked for a volunteer situation
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   where I might be able to make a difference.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Since I was a longtime student of investing,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I searched for an online site
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   where I might be able to help others
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   avoid all the mistakes I had made
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   when I first started investing.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I had a subscription to the old Morningstar binders
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   where all the data was on paper.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Then when Morningstar transitioned from paper
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   to online data subscriptions,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I found that they had established
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   several online investing forums.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   There was a generic mutual fund forum,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and that's when Taylor and other posters
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   had asked Morningstar for their own Bogle Heads forum.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   At that time, the term "Bogle Heads"
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   was a derogatory term used to make fun
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   of the group that advocated low-cost index investing
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   inspired by Jack Bogle.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Morningstar was concerned that having a forum
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   with that derogatory Bogle Heads name
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   wouldn't be appropriate,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   so they called us the Vanguard Diehards.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Taylor had already established himself
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   as a leader of the Bogle Heads on the mutual funds forum,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   but he graciously invited me to join him
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   in the Bogle Heads leadership role,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and we've been partners in the adventure
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   for the past 25 years.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   On Thanksgiving Day of 1999,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I made a post on the old Vanguard Diehards forum
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   wishing everyone a happy Thanksgiving
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and listing all the things I was thankful for.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Others chimed in and did the same.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   When Taylor made his post,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   one of the things he said he was most thankful for
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   was Jack Bogle and Vanguard,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   since his investments in low-cost Vanguard funds
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   had made it possible for him to live the good life
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   in his beautiful 35th-floor condo
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   He called his home "the house that Jack built."
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Jack Bogle used to follow our Morningstar forum
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and saw Taylor's post.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   He sent Taylor a handwritten note
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   asking if there was any interest in getting together with him
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   at a non-resort place.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Well, for us, that was like getting an invitation
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   to the White House or an audience with the Pope,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   so Taylor and I started trying to find a way
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   that we could make it happen.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   It just so happened that Jack was scheduled
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   to be a keynote speaker
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   at the 2000 Miami Herald Making Money Seminar,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   so Taylor and I figured that might be a good time
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   to take Jack up on his offer.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I contacted the Miami Herald folks
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and asked if they could arrange for us
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   to have lunch with Jack during their event,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   but they shooed us away,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   saying that Jack was too busy to spend any time with us.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   So I called Jack's office
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   and told him what the Miami Herald folks had said,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and he told me that he'd meet with us wherever we wanted.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   That's when Taylor and I decided we'd split the cost
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   for a get-together with Jack at Taylor's condo.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   We hired a chef and a maid and made a post on the forum,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   inviting other Bogo Hits to join us.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   About 20 or so forum members were able to join us
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   on short notice for that magical evening with Jack.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   When the Miami Herald folks got wind
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   of our scheduled event with Jack,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   they asked me if they could send a reporter
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and a photographer to cover our evening with Jack.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Rather than treat them like they had treated us,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I said sure, and we ended up with a nice story
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   with photos in that Sunday's Miami Herald.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   After dinner that evening,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Jack sat with us in the living room
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and answered everyone's questions.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   He then asked if he could use Taylor's computer
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   to make a post on the forum.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   In that post, Jack told the forum members
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   about his lovely evening with Taylor,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   the king of the Bogo Hits,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   and me, the prince of the Bogo Hits.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   This was my official anointment
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   as the prince of the Bogo Hits.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   When I was driving Jack back to his hotel
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   later that evening, he was telling me
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   about his mentor, Walter Morgan.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   He said that in the beginning,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   he had a hard time calling him Walter,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   and that's when I told him that I understood completely
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   because I had a hard time calling him Jack,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   as he requested.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   The following morning, Jack was the keynote speaker
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   at the Miami Herald seminar,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   followed immediately by the screaming Jim Cramer,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   who told the audience to forget what Jack had just said
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   because he was going to give them 10 hot,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   can't-miss tech stocks,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   most of which went to zero in the ensuing tech wreck.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   After the Miami hit together with Jack,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   foreign members started asking
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   when and where the next event with Jack would be held.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That surprised us,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   since we figured it would be a one-time event.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Then one of the foreign members,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   who owned a farm near Vanguard headquarters,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   offered to host the next event,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and that turned out to be our second conference with Jack.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Jason Swagg, who's currently with The Wall Street Journal,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   was with Money Magazine at that time.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   He spoke at that second conference
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and wrote a beautiful, multi-page story
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   for Money Magazine titled "Here Come the Bogleheads."
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   That story attracted lots of new foreign members,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   and our group continued to grow.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   After that second conference,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I started working with the management and sponsors of events
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   where Jack was scheduled to speak,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and we scheduled several
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   of our future Boglehead conferences that way.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The Morningstar Conference in Chicago hosted our third event,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   and the CFA instituted our next event in Denver.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   In 2005, we were busy writing the first "Bogleheads Guide"
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   and hadn't planned to hold a conference.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Jack asked when and where the next conference would be.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I told him that we were busy writing the book
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and hadn't planned to hold a conference,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   since we couldn't work things out
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   with any event where he was scheduled to speak.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   That's when he told me that he'd go
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   wherever we wanted him to go.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   At that point, I decided that we could utilize
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   the local chapters around the country
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   to help us with the planning of events in their cities,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and that's when we went out on our own.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   To help me with all the details
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   that go into planning a conference like this,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I assembled a permanent conference team
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   consisting of Ed and Patty Rager from the D.C. chapter,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Paul and Linda Gloverson,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and Mel and Kathy Turner from the San Diego chapter,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and Gail Cox from the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Together with what I called my dream team,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   we scheduled and moved the conferences around the country
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   without needing them to coordinate
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   with any outside organization.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Several of my conference dream team members
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   are in attendance tonight.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I'd like to ask Ed and Patty Rager,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Mel and Kathy Turner, and Gail Cox
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   to stand up and be recognized.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   -All right.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   -They certainly made me look good,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and I feel very lucky to have them as my dear friends.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   At the 2010 Bogo Head Conference,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   in a private conversation I had with Jack,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   he told me that he was concerned that once he was gone,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   his message would die with him.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I assured him that we would carry on,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   and that's when I suggested the Bogo Center.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Jack liked the idea
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and agreed to serve as honorary chairman
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   once I assured him that I'd serve as president
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and would take care of all the details.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   With the help of several pro bono Bogo Heads lawyers
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   and the members of my dream team,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   we got the Bogo Center for Financial Literacy up and running.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   The center then took over sponsoring the annual conferences.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I served as president for 10 years
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   before passing the baton on to the next generation
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   of younger leaders who are doing an outstanding job
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   of expanding the scope of operations of the center.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Realizing that the Bogo Heads have become a brand name,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I made the decision to trademark the Bogo Heads name.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The Bogo Center now owns
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   and protects the trademarked Bogo Heads name.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   The Bogo Heads Forum continues to grow
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and helps to carry out the Bogo Center mission
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   of financial literacy for all.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   There have been more than 700,000 posts
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   on more than 350,000 topics
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   made by more than 127,000 members.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   And we now have approximately 100 local chapters
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   around the U.S. and in many foreign countries.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Hopefully you've enjoyed this quick trip
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   down Bogo Heads memory lane as much as I have
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   and realized that you are part of a very special group.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   And we have our friend and mentor, Jack Bogo,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   to thank for all of this.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Rest in peace, Jack.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   We're continuing to spread your message as promised.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Enjoy the evening and the rest of your conference.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I hope to see many of you at next year's conference.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And in the meantime, I'll see you on the forum.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Mel, that was wonderful.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   We have a special guest who would like to address you tonight.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   What happened to Mel?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Are you still there, Mel?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   You see me okay?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   We have a special guest who wishes to address you tonight.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I'm going to ask Andrew Bogle to please come up to the stage.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   [applause]
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Thank you.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   It is my honor and privilege to be here tonight.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   We are here to celebrate the remarkable achievements
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   of a true luminary in the field of personal finance.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Thank you, Mel, for all that you've done to educate, assist,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   teach, and console hundreds of thousands of people
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   in their journey to save money and invest it wisely.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Mel's generous spirit and sharing his knowledge
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   has positively impacted countless individuals.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Mel has not only helped people secure their financial futures,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   but also given them the confidence to navigate
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   the complex financial markets.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Mel's journey is a testament to the power of lifelong learning,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   persistence, and the impact that one person can have
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   on the community, just as it's said in that video.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Please join me to congratulate Mel on his induction
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   to the Bogle Heads Hall of Fame.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   [applause]
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Okay, Mel, go ahead and speak, because we were all clapping,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   giving you a standing ovation,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   so we didn't hear anything you said.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I said I'm really honored, and I'm glad I gave my speech earlier,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   because basically I'm speechless now.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's a true honor, and I'm so pleased to honor
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   my friend and ally, Taylor, in the Bogle Center Hall of Fame,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and I hope that at some point we don't forget
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   to honor our patron saint, Jack,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and include him in the Bogle Hall of Fame,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   because he certainly deserved to be in there.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Absolutely.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Thank you, Mel, and hopefully everything goes well.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   We'll see you next year.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Take care.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   [applause]
