[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.660]   - We now have over 1,200 sermons by John Piper
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.620]   in the Desiring God sermon archive,
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.080]   but none of them are more popular than one sermon
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.980]   that stands above all the others in page views.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.600]   It's simply titled, "What is the Will of God
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120]   "and How Do We Know It?"
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   A sermon he preached on August 22nd, 2004.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.920]   In it, he answers the question,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.620]   "What is the single most important key
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.500]   "to knowing God's will in my life?
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.760]   "Like, how do I obey him?
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.160]   "In any given situation, but also,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.760]   "who does he want me to marry?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.840]   "What car should I buy?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   "What career path should I choose?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.700]   "Where should I go to school?"
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.740]   Pastor John explains how to know God's will
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.400]   in three stages from Romans 12, verses one and two.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.420]   - If I'm arguing that discern the will of God
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.340]   in verse two means discern the will of command,
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.020]   discern your duty, how does that look?
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.900]   Three stages.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.900]   Number one, God's will of command is revealed
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.700]   finally and decisively only in the Bible.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.600]   Finally and decisively, very important words.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.860]   God's will of command is revealed with final
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.860]   and decisive authority only in the Bible,
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.660]   and we must have a renewed mind in order to see it,
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.220]   because if you go to the Bible
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.680]   without having a renewed mind,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   you will find a way to distort and evade self-denial,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.840]   love, purity, the command that Jesus be supremely satisfying.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.360]   We must have the Holy Spirit illumining, transforming.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.620]   The Holy Spirit brings us Christ-exalting truth,
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.240]   and from inside, he works truth-embracing humility.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.380]   That's just gotta happen.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.240]   When you go to the Bible, you're gonna blow off
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600]   all kinds of things or twist them
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.920]   so that they fit your own self-exalting passions.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.920]   So step one is the Bible is God's revealed will,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.600]   the will of command, and it's the only place
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   where it is expressed with final and decisive authority.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.680]   Here's a text to support that claim, 2 Timothy 3.16.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.840]   All scripture is inspired by God and is profitable
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.560]   for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.960]   for training in godliness, in order that the man of God
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   might be competent, equipped for every good work, not some.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.160]   Like some good works, you gotta get messages
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   in order to do.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.080]   I won't be able to figure out the will of God here
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.760]   unless I get a message.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.120]   This text says the scriptures are inspired
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.600]   to make the Christian competent,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.520]   equipped for every good work.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400]   Second stage, first one is Bible.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.760]   We need renewed mind to understand it and apply it.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   The second stage is the application of biblical truth
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.780]   to new situations that are not explicitly addressed
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.620]   in the Bible, and there are, of course, millions of them.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.720]   The Bible does not tell you which person to marry
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360]   or whether to marry.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   The Bible does not tell you which car to drive or buy, rent.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.920]   The Bible doesn't tell you whether to buy a home or not,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   or which home to buy.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.920]   The Bible doesn't tell you where or if to take a vacation.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   The Bible doesn't tell you which cell phone plan to buy.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.320]   The Bible doesn't tell you which brand of orange juice
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.240]   to drink.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.000]   There are 10,000 decisions you must make
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.840]   that are not explicitly addressed in the Bible.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.080]   So what do you do?
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.560]   My answer is you must have a renewed mind.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.640]   That's what the text says.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.680]   Be transformed by the renewal of your mind
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.600]   that you may prove how to eat, how to drink,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.280]   cars to drive, houses to live in, missions to go on,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.640]   lifestyles to choose from, friendships to cultivate,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.400]   conversations to have and not to have.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.600]   10,000 decisions not written in the Bible,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.680]   and yet informed by all the teaching of the Bible
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.600]   into this new mind so that you think with the mind of Christ
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   and assess things the way Christ would assess them
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.880]   so that the decisions that are made really
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.440]   are flowing from the revealed will of God in the Bible
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.320]   as it transforms your mind.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.360]   Lastly, 95% of your life is unpremeditated.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.320]   I'm just picking 95% out of the blue.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.840]   You pick a number.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.200]   95% of your life is unpremeditated.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.440]   Thoughts, attitudes, actions are spontaneous.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.720]   They just are spillover, and the Bible is keenly aware of this
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.280]   and addresses it like this.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.800]   Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.240]   The good person out of his good treasure,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.920]   substitute the person with the renewed mind.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.360]   The good person, the person with the renewed mind,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.960]   out of the good treasure brings forth good.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.480]   And the evil person out of the evil treasure
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.000]   brings forth evil.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.800]   I tell you, on the day of judgment,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.200]   people will give an account for every careless word,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.640]   the ones you didn't think about at all, namely, most of them.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's got to be that way.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   You cannot stop before every sentence
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.520]   and ponder the use of your verbs and nouns.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.680]   It's impossible to communicate that way.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.040]   You must just keep talking.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.480]   And if you were standing out here, you'd say,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.040]   "Where is all that coming from?
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   Because I'm not thinking in detail about which sentence to use
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.360]   and which adjective to use and what tone of voice to use
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.960]   and whether these gestures should keep going."
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.000]   And just your life is spillover.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.160]   95% of the time, your life is spillover.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.120]   And you may ask, "Well, why are you calling that part of the will of command?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.360]   Because it sounds like, you know, will of command would be,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.200]   I'm hearing a command, I'm thinking about it, and then I'm doing it.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.360]   And I'm calling it the will of command because you get in the Bible commands,
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.960]   'Don't be angry, don't be prideful, don't covet,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.720]   don't be anxious, don't be jealous, don't envy.'
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.440]   And you don't think of any of those.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.840]   Nobody decides to be prideful.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.160]   Now, see, I'm humble, but I really like to be prideful.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.680]   So now I will make a decision to become prideful.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.120]   Or I'm not feeling any envy right now, but I see somebody has something,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.200]   I think I'll start feeling envy.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.480]   Or I don't have enough and covetousness would be one way to respond.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.440]   I think I'll respond with covetousness."
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.720]   Nobody lives like that.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.800]   Those things happen to you and you are guilty because they're coming out of your heart.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.440]   I don't, by and large, live my life by lists.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.280]   You try to live your life by lists,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.520]   either the list will be ridiculous in its shortness compared to the 10,000 things you do each day,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.920]   or it will be so long you die.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.240]   There's only one way to live the Christian life.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:26.160]   Don't be conformed, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.280]   It's our only hope.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.880]   Life is too spontaneous.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.000]   You just can't live it by lists.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.200]   You can't live it even by the Ten Commandments because 95% of the time you're doing stuff
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.600]   without reflecting on whether it breaks any commandment.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   You're just doing stuff.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.280]   My biggest challenge is, "Piper, be new.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   Be new.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.160]   Just get at the core of my being.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:01.520]   If there's any stuff, junk, pride left down there that's just causing the stuff to come
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:08.760]   out unbidden and unplanned, get at me down there, Lord."
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.080]   That's the only hope, isn't it?
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:19.280]   So concluding exhortation, immerse yourself in God's Word.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.400]   Saturate your mind with it.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.680]   I don't know any other way.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   I'm 58.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:32.960]   Two years ago, I said to the staff at a January meeting, "At age 56, I want to give my life
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.480]   to memorizing like I've never memorized before."
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   I'll say that even stronger right now.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.560]   I'm into mega Bible memorization.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:52.360]   I don't know any other way to saturate, transform, shape, alter, bring my mind into conformity
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.640]   to the mind of Christ than by memorizing and meditating upon His Word.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.360]   So I don't think you have a chance of a snowball in hell to be holy and avoid that kind of
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.160]   language if you don't meditate on the Word of God a lot.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.920]   So immerse yourself in the Bible.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.320]   Get serious about a renewed mind.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.600]   That is valuable counsel.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.000]   Once again, this excerpt comes from the most popular sermon we have in the DG Sermon Archive.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.640]   It's titled, "What is the Will of God and How Do We Know It?"
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.160]   Which was preached on August 22, 2004.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.440]   You can find it on our website at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.080]   Also be sure to listen to episode number 181 in this podcast series.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.160]   Episode 181 was titled, "How Do We Know God's Will?"
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.000]   Well tomorrow we hear from a wife who caught her husband checking out a young, attractive
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.840]   woman at the grocery store.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.380]   The wife is, of course, heartbroken.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.680]   But should she say anything to him?
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.560]   We'll hear Pastor John respond to that tomorrow.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.560]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.520]   Thanks for listening to the daily Ask Pastor John podcast.
