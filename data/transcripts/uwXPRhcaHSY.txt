[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.180]   That's Trip Lee's title track off his latest album, Rise.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.600]   Trip, as you know, fighting for joy in Christ is a daily battle in the Christian life.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.720]   So how do you pursue joy in Christ and is this something that you set out to achieve
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.860]   every given day?
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.740]   Last time in episode 593, you shared with us about your daily trials.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.200]   So now talk to us about pursuing joy in God in the midst of these struggles.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.660]   Yeah, it's definitely a pursuit because if I don't set out to find or achieve joy in
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.080]   God in any given day, I just won't have it.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.360]   One of the unlikely gifts of even suffering, the kind of suffering that I've been through
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.960]   in the past few years with chronic fatigue, which is small suffering compared to a lot
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.440]   of people's others, but one of the things that that does, it tears down some of the
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.760]   idols that I look to for joy.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.640]   And so I'm tempted to find my joy in success or my own spiritual performance or how good
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.360]   of a husband I am or my relationship's going well.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.320]   When I wake up in the morning, that's when I'm tempted to go to find my joy.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.520]   So if I don't fight to find it in God, I just won't.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.000]   So the main things I'm doing every day to fight for joy is I'm trying to look away from
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   those things.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.240]   I'm fighting in my heart to look away from those and fighting to really look to Jesus.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.480]   For me, it happens mainly in the Word and in prayer.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.320]   So for example, right now I'm reading the Gospel of Luke, and as I'm reading through
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.720]   this incredible story about Jesus and the things he did and the things he said, I'm
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.400]   pleading with God to open the eyes of my heart to see how incredible Jesus is.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.440]   So when I'm reading chapter one and everyone's rejoicing at the coming of this King, I'm
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.880]   asking myself, "Man, does my heart rejoice like this in Jesus?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   And why not?
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.920]   God, help me to rejoice.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.920]   Help me to see."
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.560]   And so when I'm reading the Scripture, it's always this kind of back and forth with God.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.320]   As I'm listening to Him and I'm pleading with Him, "Lord, help me respond well.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   Give me grace.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   I need your Spirit."
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.280]   And it doesn't always happen right then, though.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.160]   It's not this automatic switch I flip.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.880]   Sometimes I leave with the same amount of joy I had before.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.640]   But if I get so discouraged at my lack of joy that I'm unwilling to fight for it, then
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.840]   I will never have joy in Christ, because it is not a magic switch.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.400]   We have to fight for it through the Word and prayer and fellowship, etc., and all the means
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   of grace God has given us, and God graciously grants it to us.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.120]   But it's that consistent fight.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.320]   For me, at least, it really bears fruit, not just one day here or there.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.080]   Consistency in that fight has been huge in my fight for joy.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.640]   So it is like every day, individually, I have to fight.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.600]   But it seems to me that when I'm inconsistent, inconsistency always leads to less joy for
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   me in my experience, and consistency is always huge for me.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.360]   Yes, discipline is so key, and joy in God is essential.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   We talk a lot about joy and desiring God.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.040]   So how do we avoid making joy into our idol?
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.080]   That was a question John Piper picked up and addressed back in episode number 120 in this
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.760]   podcast series.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.480]   You can find it in the archive.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.860]   Well, can fame and popularity make us happy?
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.560]   For those of us nobodies who are not famous, we respond with a quick "no."
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.280]   But what would a relatively famous Christian like Trip Lee say?
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.040]   I'll ask him tomorrow.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.920]   Trip's new album and his new book are both titled "Rise."
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.000]   You can find them at Amazon right now.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'll see you tomorrow.
