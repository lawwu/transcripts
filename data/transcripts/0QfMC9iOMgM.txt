[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   I definitely think that recent developments in AI have made me a bit more freaked out.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.320]   And even since I wrote The Most Important Century series and before that, there were
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.480]   years when Open Philanthropy was very interested in AI risk, but it's become more so as we've
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.060]   seen the progress in AI.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.800]   What we're seeing is we're seeing these very simple systems and is able to do a lot of
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.880]   different tasks.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.240]   This very simple language model that just predicts the next word it's going to see in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.520]   a stream of text.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.200]   People have gotten it to tell stories.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.560]   People got it to analyze and explain jokes.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.280]   People have gotten it to play kind of role-playing games, write poetry, write lyrics, answer
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.120]   multiple choice questions, answer trivia questions.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.560]   And one of the results that I found most ridiculous and strange was this thing called Minerva
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.080]   where people took one of these language models and with very little intervention, very little
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.660]   special intervention, they got it to do these like difficult math problems and explain its
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.000]   reasoning and get them right about half the time.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.880]   And so I think that we just see AI systems having all these unpredictable human-like
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.800]   abilities just from having this very simple training procedure.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600]   And that is something I find wild and scary.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   I don't know exactly where it's going or how fast.
