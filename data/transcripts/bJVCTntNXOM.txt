[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   - Hey guys, recently we've been talking a lot about content creation for marketing,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.320]   and you can do it in many different forms and many mediums.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.120]   One thing we have not yet talked about is the realm of live streaming content and then
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.880]   on demand from that.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720]   And so joining us to talk about that is Jonathan Harrelson.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.640]   - Hey, what's going on guys?
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.640]   I'm Jonathan Harrelson.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.640]   I'm a content creator.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640]   I create on Twitch.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.640]   I create on YouTube.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.760]   I create written content like blogs and stuff like that.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.240]   And yeah, super stoked to be here.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.800]   Super stoked to be speaking with you, Tim, and hopefully giving your audience some great
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520]   insights on live streaming and content creation in general.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520]   - Cool.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960]   Jonathan, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960]   And this conversation is actually really, really interesting to me because it actually
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.600]   falls outside my comfort zone.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.040]   You know, like when you're in a B2B world, when you're working, it's like, oh, it'd be
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.560]   so cool if I can do X, Y, and Z as a passion project and find content for people to discover.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.800]   It's actually quite a lot of work.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.960]   And you're kind of like Jack of all trades where you've kind of figured out a happy medium
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.440]   on like where to do things live, where to do things on demand.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.080]   And you've kind of figured out all the tools to do that.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.560]   And so today I would love to kind of hear a little bit about like what you're doing
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.520]   from a live streaming point of view and all that goes into like what genre you're using,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.360]   like how are you finding your audience and then how you're promoting it.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200]   And then after we do that, we'll talk about some of the on demand stuff that you're working
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.520]   on like podcasts.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.880]   And then for the second half of today's call and conversation, I would love to hear about
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.680]   like just technology or your setup for equipment.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.200]   And there's a bunch of people like myself for maybe just getting into this.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.880]   So like what does it look like for starters and then as you get more advanced.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.960]   So let's just start with you, like how long you've been doing this, like what kind of
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.240]   videos are you creating and where can we find you usually?
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.000]   So usually if you see me live streaming, I'm live streaming on Twitch.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.520]   I've been streaming on Twitch for, oh my goodness, I think about six or seven years now.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.080]   I don't consider myself a huge content creator.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.780]   It's really a grind and I've really started focusing on trying to create content outside
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.360]   of Twitch within the last, I want to say a year or two.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.680]   Just because inherently live streams, they're not very searchable.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.680]   You can't really find live streams unless you're searching and especially when it comes
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.720]   to Twitch, Twitch prioritizes their live streams by the amount of viewers.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.680]   So the more viewers you have, the higher up on the list that you're going to be for that
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.080]   particular genre or game that you're playing.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.560]   With that being said, I am moving away from gaming content creation.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.040]   I have a new project launching in a few weeks geared towards men's mental health, which
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.560]   is going to take me pretty much completely away from gaming.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.040]   I'll still do it on the side and create, you know, small clips of content, but it's not
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.560]   going to be like my primary form of content creation.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.360]   So it's going to be a podcast, it'll be a video podcast, very similar to this one, but
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.440]   I'm going to be live streaming the podcast to the various platforms, whether it's Twitch
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.720]   and YouTube.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.200]   There's a couple other ones that I'm looking into, but searchability with live streaming
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.280]   is really the biggest hurdle.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   And that's where you have to kind of branch out and know how to do like some video editing
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.280]   techniques and some sound engineering and stuff like that.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.760]   So you really do have to be a jack of all trades when it comes to this type of content
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   creation.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.360]   So kind of understanding how different platforms promote your content based on algorithm is
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   really important, right?
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.080]   So I think you mentioned like Twitch, like I've always associated Twitch primarily with
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   the gaming audience.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.760]   I'm not sure if they go much beyond that since there's so much tied to video game platforms
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760]   as well.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   So that makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.260]   I think building your community and getting active in your community so they can discover
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.040]   you or follow you and you can schedule or make them aware when you're going live.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.880]   Is that typically how you organically create kind of awareness and demand for your live
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   streams?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.320]   Yeah, it's, it's that.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.440]   And it's also it's also being consistent.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.920]   So having a consistent schedule for your live streams is huge because that gives reliability
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   for your audience.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   No, okay.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.080]   I'm going to be on, he's going to be on at this time every week or every day, depending
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   on your, on your streaming schedule.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.160]   And you know, you just got to be like clockwork logging in.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   And then the other thing is the other challenge, especially like with gaming content, I played
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.480]   pretty much the same two games to be honest.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200]   So that content can seem to be really stale.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.600]   So you have to find creative ways to try to make that content a little bit more interesting,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   whether it's creating challenges for yourself.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.320]   Like for instance, like I play call of duty.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.440]   So it's like, okay, can I get, if I'm playing multiplayer, can I get 30 kills in a game?
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.040]   You know, can I beat my personal best or, you know let me run around with nothing but
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.220]   pistols or, or something like that.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.840]   So really just trying to create a challenge.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   Or if you, if you play multiple games, there's a content creator that I follow called Dr.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.500]   he goes by the name of Dr. Disrespect and he, he runs what he calls triple threat, triple
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   threat challenges.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.320]   So he'll be like, okay, I'm going to get a win in solos on call of duty, fortnight and
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.360]   player unknowns battlegrounds.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   Can he do it?
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.600]   So these are, these are kind of methods that, that gaming content creators use to try to
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.320]   keep their audience engaged, try to keep their content a little bit more fresh and try to
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.200]   vary, create certain variations of their content.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.760]   Even though at the end of the day, the content is the same.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.520]   The goal for each piece of content is a little bit different.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.480]   Actually, you said a few things there that I really want to kind of pick apart and kind
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   of double down on.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Cause it's a fantastic information.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.160]   And I think it's actually directly related to even the B2B world, right?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.840]   And you said, you said something around like schedule and routine where you have a dependable
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   rollout schedule.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.480]   So people know when to log in.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.440]   You know, if I think about even the B2B or even coaching world, right, where let's say
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.400]   I set a schedule where every Thursday is, you know, I'm going to be online from eight
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.080]   to nine central, let's say, and that's going to be an open QA for all things, let's say
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   technology.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   And maybe I'll have a guest that day.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.680]   And maybe on every Friday, it's going to be a creative discussion, right?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.880]   And maybe on Mondays it's around marketing and demand gen, building and following and
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.720]   having a regular schedule where you're going to talk about things allows people to be prepared
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   as well.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.680]   So like in my example, there is more of like B2B, but like, again, if, if you know, you're
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.280]   going to show up on Wednesday, cause you're talking about web marketing and SEO, like
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.960]   you'll come prepared with questions or to your earlier point around that kind of drumming
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.880]   up interest from an audience.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.200]   Like you start Wednesday is SEO day and people like the SEO tribe will know when to kind
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   of pitch in and kind of expect certain people to show up.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.120]   So I think that's a really, really good, good point.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120]   I'm kind of curious.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.040]   So you're talking about Twitch and how they kind of, the algorithm kind of bubbles up
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   your, your visibility for YouTube live or even like other platforms, I know Facebook
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   does as well.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.880]   I'm a little less familiar with that, but for a YouTube, how do they increase your visibility?
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.920]   Is that similar in terms of how many watches or how many concurrent users and that pushes
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   you up or.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.640]   Again it's, it's kind of the same thing.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.760]   It's the, it's concurrent viewers, but where your value comes in, like on a YouTube livestream,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.800]   YouTube actually creates a video on demand that's stored on your channel at that point,
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.560]   which you can then go in and update the title of the, the title of the video.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.600]   It becomes basically a standard video at that point where you, you run your standard SEO
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   practices on the title, on the tags, on the, on the, the video description and everything
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.800]   like that.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.480]   And where you get your real value out of it is the residual visits from after this, after
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.120]   the live stream goes live versus Twitch, depending on, depending on your relationship with Twitch,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   whether you're a non-affiliate, an affiliate or a partner, non-affiliates, non-affiliates
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.480]   and non-partners, those videos, those live streams are on the platform, are stored on
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.440]   the platform for only 14 days.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.520]   And then if you're an affiliate or you're a partner, it's stored for, I believe 30 or
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.040]   45 days at that point.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.160]   But that content does not live in perpetuity or as long as your account, as long as your
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.920]   account is live versus YouTube, YouTube does a really good job of keeping that content
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.800]   living in perpetuity as long as your account is live and you don't have any strikes against
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   you or anything.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.600]   And it's a great way to monetize and supplement as well, giving you the ability to post like
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:22.000]   affiliate links or like donation links or whatever, whatever, whatever your, your like
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.840]   requirement is like, yeah, your call to actions, it's, it's way more prominent on YouTube than
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.720]   it is on Twitch.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   So that's why, you know, I'm, I'm, I streamed to both Twitch and YouTube, like this, this
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.480]   new podcast that I'm doing, I'm going to be streaming to both Twitch and YouTube at the
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   same time.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.400]   And, you know, you said you associate, you associate Twitch with gaming and a lot of
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   people do that.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.720]   You know, if you look at 95% of the people out there, they, they associate Twitch with
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   gaming.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   And that's, that's fair.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.080]   I mean, I started out as a company called Justin TV and it was basically this kid, Justin,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.600]   who was basically live streaming his gaming content.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.320]   And that's kind of where it got built from.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.760]   Since Amazon has purchased it, Amazon has really started to push it as, as a marketing
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.160]   platform as well.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.600]   I mean, they host, they host AWS events on their various AWS events.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.880]   I mean, they, they even have like Thursday night football for NFL because you know, they,
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.460]   they own the Thursday night pack, Amazon owns the Thursday night package now.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.040]   So they're really trying to broaden the horizons of what Twitch can do and get people to think
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.160]   outside the norm of Twitch.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:32.040]   And to be honest, the, the biggest, the biggest genre on Twitch right now is like just chatting
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.580]   or IRL.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580]   So it's not even gaming.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.480]   It's like people going out eating or it's groups of friends just hanging out and talking
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.240]   and you know, just doing stupid stuff.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.280]   And people come in and watch that like hot tub streams is, was like the big meta on,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   on Twitch.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.320]   You know, that's just, I call it smut because it's, you know, I'm not going to go into it,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.040]   but you know, but that's the audience that, that's the audience that some of those, some
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.640]   of those streamers attract.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.880]   So you have to look at it that way too.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   Okay.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.480]   Where is my audience going to be?
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.760]   My audience, if my audience associates Twitch with, with gaming, then that's probably not
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.100]   the best place for me to be as a marketer versus, you know, maybe I should stick to
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   YouTube.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.320]   You know, YouTube has, has the better, the better platform, the better algorithm, because
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   guess what?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.160]   Once you're, once your VOD goes, once you have your VOD on there, now you can show up
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.120]   in suggested and suggested results.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.200]   You can show up in search results and you can also show up in Google search results
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.520]   if you have all your SEO stuff done.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.880]   So from a, from a, from a B2B standpoint YouTube takes it over Twitch, but you can still live
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880]   stream.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:45.000]   I've, I watch plenty of creators live stream their podcasts a, a, a content creator group
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.120]   that I, that I follow called Think Media.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.360]   This is exactly what they do.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.500]   And they utilize YouTube to build their brand and to help others build their, build their
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.800]   content creation brands.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.640]   And YouTube is, is probably the biggest powerful tool when it comes to a content creator's
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   job.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:08.240]   And actually that's a wonderful segue to moving from like live events or webinars or streams
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240]   to on demand.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.240]   Cause you're right.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.360]   Living on perpetuity and being able to monetize long form content that's evergreen is really
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.320]   where like you want to go.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.400]   You and I kind of talked, you know, when we were kind of in prior to this call around
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   just analytics.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.060]   I think something that really interested me is like, you know, when you looked at the
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.640]   traffic post event was on demand, you're kind of looking at the volume of traffic and you're
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.780]   making some tweaks, whether it's duration of the video or whatnot to kind of monitor
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.040]   when spikes happen and noticing trends.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.400]   Can you share some of those insights with us?
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.760]   So the, one of the biggest thing when it comes to analytics with YouTube is it also connects
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.200]   in with Google analytics.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.560]   You don't get that with with Twitch on top of that.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.000]   So you get a, you get a more granular look at the data.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.480]   They have a really robust analytics platform in the, in the creator dashboard and you can,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   you can make tweaks.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.800]   You can tweak the, the stream titles or you can tweak the video titles.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.740]   You can actually do AB testing on like the thumbnails and stuff.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.360]   These are things that you cannot do on really any other platform and that's, that's really
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   what makes it powerful.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.960]   So for me, you know, I might go a week testing one, uh, one thumbnail and then change, change
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   the thumbnail.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.500]   Uh, next week there's, there's a services that you can use to kind of run it automatically
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.640]   so you don't have to go in and manually change it.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.320]   And uh, in, in the interest of, uh, uh, budget friendliness, I just go in and do it myself
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.720]   and then monitor, monitor the week over week results.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:46.040]   Um, but yeah, being able to do those things and then, you know, figuring out, okay, what
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.920]   different types of content work.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   Okay.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   I have this wonderful podcast.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.440]   We had a really good three minute, three minute or 60 second conversation.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.040]   Let me create, let me create a short form content off of that, that I can share on a
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.320]   vertical device like a phone.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   So I can put it on tick tock.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.640]   I can put it on youtube shorts.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.560]   Youtube shorts has probably been the biggest revelation to me and my channel personally.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:14.920]   Uh, on average, my youtube shorts get between a 700 and 1500 views just depending on the,
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.220]   the type of tags and stuff and the time that you post.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.920]   But it's a great way to get mass exposure in a, in a very, very short time.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.320]   And I'm talking about like those, those 700 to 1500 views come within the first hour of
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.040]   posting it if you post it at the right time and posting at the right time depends on your
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   audience.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   Right.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.680]   You don't want to be, the gaming audience posts, uh, is, is usually flipping through
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.800]   their phones, you know, a little bit later at night, um, versus your business audience,
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.400]   your B2B audience is probably going to be flipping through it.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.440]   Not as late.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.800]   And when I say late, it's like, you know, 11, 12 o'clock my time.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.300]   That's when I get the best results.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.280]   But a B2B audience, you might be looking at, you know, six or seven o'clock, uh, six or
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.480]   seven o'clock my time, um, you know, while people are doing, getting dinner, sitting
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.440]   at the table, uh, you know, doing their nightly routines, what have you, that's, that's really
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.000]   when the B2B crowd might actually get to, uh, view it, get all those views in.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.280]   So it's a powerful, it's a powerful like top of funnel action to use the, the YouTube shorts
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.120]   and just be mindful that like with YouTube shorts, you have one minute with tick tock,
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.480]   you have three minutes, um, I think with Instagram reels, I think you have up to three minutes
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   as well.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.200]   So you have to be mindful of, of how long of the content that you need and then what
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.000]   platform you're going to be posting it on.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.600]   And typically are those, um, like short form videos, just straight edits out of a current
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.200]   video or do you do additional post-production on top of that?
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:46.320]   So you kind of lead in with the intro or something to give a context, like, does it matter?
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   It depends.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.720]   So it depends on the situation, right?
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.400]   If, if we're talking about, if we're talking about like content creation for streamers,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   right?
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.160]   Uh, you might lead in with, you might not want to miss, you might not want to miss this
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.920]   or you know, there's a, there's a editing technique that a lot of tick talkers and YouTube
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.480]   and YouTubers, uh, who create YouTube shorts use where it looks like a seamless loop.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.560]   So the, they, they lead in kind of like with the ending and then they, they start back
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.120]   at the beginning and then it cuts off the actual video cuts off right at the end so
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.680]   that it looks like a smooth transition.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.240]   When the video restarts, you're catching, it looks like you're catching it all the way
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.360]   through the end and then it's restarting again.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.320]   So there's different, there's different techniques of doing it.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.400]   Um, I haven't quite mastered it yet, but I'm working on it.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.640]   Uh, gaming content.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.120]   Like I said, for me, it's, uh, it's, it's pretty much just kind of a straight edit at
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.360]   a couple overlays with, uh, with my channel information and stuff on it and just send
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   it out the door.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.840]   Um, I could get real elaborate with, you know, post-production techniques like taking it
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.120]   into, I use DaVinci Resolve for video editing.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.280]   I could take it in there, create slow-mo sequences, zoom in, zoom out, uh, things like that.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.560]   But for me, I want, I just want to get content, content out quick.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.120]   And so I'm just literally, I have a template that I use.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.240]   I have a, I have my overlay set and I just replace the videos, export, send it out.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.840]   It takes me five to 10 minutes to, to cut and edit a, uh, a complete like YouTube short,
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.200]   a 30 second YouTube short.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   And that's interesting.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.860]   So that clever editing where it basically is on endless loop without a viewer realizing
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.040]   it until they say, Hey, I've seen this already before.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.800]   I'm assuming that like helps your Google analytics, right?
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.680]   It's like you're, you're getting no repeat views or, or it was actually kind of hurt
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.480]   you at some point.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.280]   It doesn't, it actually helps a lot because it's, it, each, each view counts as a view.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.160]   So it kind of helps boost your numbers.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.480]   And the more, the more, so the way the YouTube algorithm works is the more views you get,
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.000]   the more that your, your video is suggested because that means it's relevant.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.200]   It works just like Google search.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.320]   The more views you get, the more the algorithm says, Hey, this video is relevant to what
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.840]   this person is looking for, what they're looking at or what, what interests them.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   So the more views, the better.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.080]   And if they're rewatching the videos and over and over and over, that's telling the algorithm,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.200]   Hey, this is really resonating with the view, this, this particular viewer, this particular
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.740]   viewer likes these types of videos.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.160]   Let's go ahead and push this video to other viewers who, who fit this same profile.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.840]   And earlier I remember you mentioned like find different platforms to upload content,
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   right?
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.320]   You mentioned Instagram as amongst others.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.960]   Now when you do your podcast that you're coming up with, it's a VOD like video or not, I'm
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.000]   assuming that, you know, there is obviously you can post a video to video friendly platforms.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.680]   Are you also going to be exporting like audio only ones to like, like Apple podcasts or
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.640]   other, like Spotify or something like that?
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.640]   A hundred percent.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.540]   So I have another podcast that I, that I do as well.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.700]   It's called a gaming moment and it's again, gaming content.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.920]   So it's gaming, streaming technology, content creation just anything around gaming and content
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.960]   creation and gaming content creation.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.680]   And we do we do live streams to YouTube and Twitch.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.840]   We're also recording the audio where we have a high quality audio file that gets spit out
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.240]   at the end with both of our, like our tracks are different audio files.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:22.280]   So we can take that into our audio editing software and delete like, okay, we, somebody
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.560]   coughed or, you know, we, we record from our houses.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.080]   You know, my kid came in in the middle of a, of a quiet piece and you hear my kid come
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.600]   in so we can, we can cut that little piece out in, in post-production.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.900]   And then we can do some post-production audio sweetening, like, you know, noise reduction,
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.180]   bring up the base a little bit you know, really make our voices in the audio really stand
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.640]   out and remove any kind of background noise where we can.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:54.680]   So being a podcaster and a video podcaster on top of that, you have to think about, you
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.320]   know, your, your audio quality for your, your, your audio podcast, and you have to think
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.600]   about your audio and video quality for your video podcast.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.720]   And you got to think about, okay, how do I do the content syndication for all of this?
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.360]   You know, where do, where do I send all this?
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.320]   So hosting platforms and, you know, like I said, you being a content creator, you have,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.120]   you really have to be a jack of all trades because as a podcaster, I'm a video editor,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.240]   I'm an audio engineer you know, we have a website that we maintain.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.720]   So I'm a web developer, which is kind of what I do during my day job anyway.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.440]   I'm a, you know, I'm a marketer, I'm a social, I'm a social media influencer, or social,
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.360]   you know, social media manager.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.000]   I'm also a content writer.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.760]   I'm a producer, you know, you have to, you have to wear all of these hats, especially
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.200]   if you're like a one or two man show, it can be a lot and it turns into like a full time
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.360]   and a half job.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   Hmm.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.920]   So, so I know one of the things that kind of gets in people's way in terms of like getting
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.640]   a velocity is all of the work required, right?
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   Like for me, like I'm one of these videos, I'm realizing, oh man, so it's quite a lot
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.640]   of work, right?
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   To do this.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.240]   And for me to think about the editing that's required, that whether it's a short, which
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.400]   is one edit, and there's obviously cleaning up audio for the main ones, and then uploading
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.200]   to various platforms and making sure the metadata there and it's SEO friendly, like, what would
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.160]   you say is the average time you spend on, let's say one piece of video, let's just assume
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.360]   the video is, let's say 20 minutes and you want to leverage that for short audio formats
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   as well.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.880]   Like how much time do you spend uploading to all of your properties?
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   Okay.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.360]   So I'll give you an example of like the gaming moment podcast.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.980]   So we probably spend about two hours a week gathering topics to talk about that scouring
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.560]   social media, scouring Google for latest news topics and trends.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.660]   Then we take those topics, we look at, okay, what is their traffic value, right?
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.400]   What are going to be our two main pieces of content that we talk about?
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:01.560]   Because the way we structure our podcast is we have a segment that does two main things
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.900]   that we include in our, that's like our episode title, right?
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.520]   And then we have a general banter section, which is, you know, smaller topics that are
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.640]   less SEO optimized where people aren't really searching for as much.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.360]   So it's, it's taking these topics, going to like Google trends, getting the data running
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.400]   the analysis on that.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.840]   So all of that right there, just getting the content curated for one episode is probably
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.280]   four to five hours a week.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.520]   And then, and then you know, when we record the podcast, our podcasts are about an hour
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   long.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.520]   So it's like a, we were, we're on for an hour before kind of going over, going over the
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.480]   podcast script and making sure everything is good.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.440]   And when I say script, it's more like an outline.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.040]   But making sure that we understand the topics that we're going to be talking about, because
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.520]   we want to sound knowledgeable.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.900]   So we're on for an hour before we even start recording.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.920]   And then when we record, we're usually recording for like an hour and a half because you know,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.600]   we'll have certain areas where we're like, I didn't like the way that sounded.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.000]   Let me, let me restart that.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.800]   So then you're looking at like an hour and a half there.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.200]   So that's, that's two and a half.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:11.640]   So you're up to six and a half, almost seven hours of, of just, of just that.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   Okay.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.400]   So now we have the podcast recorded.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.680]   Now we got to edit it.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.840]   It takes about a couple, it takes about two hours to edit a, a, a one hour long podcast
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.600]   to cut out all the dead space, all the mess ups.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.800]   And as you do, as you edit, you become more and more proficient at it and you figure out
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.000]   little tricks so that when you're looking at, when you're looking at the podcast, audio
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.240]   waveforms, like, you know, we might do a snap in the, in the microphone to create a high,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.520]   a high waveform and we know, okay, this is a bad section visually.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.240]   We can cut from here to here.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.880]   Um, and uh, so we reduce our editing times, uh, that way.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.040]   And then, okay, we have it edited the hosting platform that we use.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.880]   We use a hosting platform called buzzsprout.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:01.320]   And when we upload, uh, when we upload the, the MP3 audio to buzzsprout and we publish
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.640]   it, um, it handles all of our content syndication for us.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:11.280]   So it automatically pushes out to Google podcasts, Apple, uh, Apple podcasts, Spotify, pod bean,
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.320]   every, every podcasting platform, stitch stitcher, uh, that, that, that you can imagine.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.000]   So that handles, that handles the vast majority of our content syndication as it, as it pertains
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.320]   to getting our plat, our podcast onto the multiple platforms.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.680]   So choosing a podcast host in this case is, is, uh, is huge, making sure that they, that
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.960]   they do the syndication and stuff for you.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   And they give you an RSS feed if you want to use it to, uh, uh, somewhere else.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.040]   Um, and then from there I take, I take the podcast, I run it through an AI, uh, program
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.640]   that gets, that gets the transcriptions done.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.760]   Then you have to read through the transcription, make sure that words are spelled correctly.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.760]   Um, every, everything looks good.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.400]   So again, you're having to listen and do the transcription.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.440]   So that's another hour.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.320]   So you're up to, you're up to nine hours.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.720]   Um, and now you have to do, now you have to do your social media promotions.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:07.200]   So I, I do three social media, I schedule three social media posts per week for each
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   new episode.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.800]   So I use a platform like Hootsuite or a buffer to be able to schedule those out.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.040]   Um, I make sure I include images with each one and I try to change, change the images
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   with each one.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.240]   So I use Canva to create the images really easily, export them out cause they have beautiful
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.640]   templates and all I have to do is just kind of change a few things here and there.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.360]   So creating the images, you might be looking at another hour, creating the, uh, the, the,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.080]   creating the, uh, the tweets or the, the social media posts put together.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   That's another hour.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.960]   Thank God for chat GPT now, cause that, that helps save, that helps save a lot of time.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.240]   So I mean, all in all, when, when you look at it and that's not even, this isn't even
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.440]   including like, okay, we have all these topics, I'm going to create a blog around each topic
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.520]   to post to the website.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.720]   So not, not even including that you're up to pretty close to like 12 hours a week, just
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:05.000]   uh, uh, scripting, editing, publishing, promoting.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   That's awesome.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.880]   And that's, that's overwhelming for people here for the first time, but actually it makes
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   a lot of sense.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.920]   And I can definitely see how the more you do it, you kind of kind of pick up some shortcuts
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.040]   to kind of give yourself some notes and audible cues.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.360]   So that's really smart.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   I hope to kind of give myself some shortcuts as well as I kind of go through this process.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   Um, cool.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.080]   So let's kind of transition to the second part of this conversation, which is around
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.160]   like the, the tools or equipment you would need.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.240]   And I know that you had shared with me like a webpage that you had actually set up with
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   all of those.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.000]   And, um, actually I do, I don't mind, do you mind sharing that with us, um, on screen and
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.680]   then we kind of walk us through, I'm kind of curious, like how you would pick and choose
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.800]   maybe something for a beginner, um, versus not.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.720]   Um, cause again, we're always looking at cost of entry to, you know, this livelihood of
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   content creation.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:26:00.360]   Yeah, you can definitely get by with, um, you know, some fairly budget equipment or,
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.560]   or some bare minimums.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   So I have a, I created a blog on a gaming moment.com it's a five budget buys to enhance
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.800]   your content quality, um, where you really want to spend your money, especially if you're
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.200]   creating audio based content like a podcast or a video based content, even a video based
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.120]   content like pod, this podcast, if you will.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.400]   You want to, you want to spend your money where it matters the most.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.920]   So obviously having a good quality mic is, uh, is a huge priority.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.000]   Um, there's, there's so many like smaller podcasts that I've listened to where it sounds
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.120]   like they're, they're talking in another room because their mic is not great or they're
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.600]   using, they're using a headset microphone, like the headset that I have on right now.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.440]   And the audio quality for those is just not there.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:52.120]   So like my personal mic that I use, I use an audio technica AT 2020 and those are like
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.480]   $99 now.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   So it's like a hundred dollars.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.000]   Uh, I believe you're using a blue, a blue Yeti, which is like 80, $89 or something now.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.140]   And these are, these are solid entry level condenser microphones that produce really
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.680]   great sound.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.800]   Um, the other thing is like if you're doing video content, lighting, lighting is a huge
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   thing.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.300]   So if I turned off my two lights right here, it would, it would look really bad because
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:21.220]   it's the glow of the computer screen in front of me and, and you know, I have a green screen
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.300]   in the back for a lot of my other content creation.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.920]   So that green screen would show up because it's not, it's not lit well enough.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.460]   Um, lighting can adjust the mood of a video.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.980]   Like if I turned off my left light, I would have this light right here and I'd have more
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.980]   of a shadow right here.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.520]   I'm going to give it a little bit different kind of effect.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.760]   So lighting, lighting can really change the mood and the atmosphere of the videos that
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.620]   you're, that you're shooting.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.100]   Um, a good quality camera.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:51.580]   I'm not saying you got to go out and buy like this high end cinema camera, a good DSLR,
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:59.260]   like a Canon EOS M50 or a rebel even, you know, you can get, you can get a decent quality
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.500]   DSLR camera for like 250, 300 bucks.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.660]   And um, like Canon has, has, has come a long way in the last couple of years, creating
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:14.220]   free software for you to be able to use the camera as a webcam, uh, which is, which is
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.220]   what I do.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.340]   The camera that I'm using on this stream today is a Canon EOS M50.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:24.180]   Uh, but I do have other webcams that I have available, which, you know, if, if you're,
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.460]   if like 500 bucks is out of your budget, cause that's about five or 600 bucks is about what
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.900]   the Canon EOS M50 is.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.900]   You can definitely get, um, you know, a standard webcam.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.940]   The one that I, that I highly recommend is the Logitech 9, uh, C920 series there.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:44.620]   They range from like 50 to 70 bucks, you know, depending on the, the, the time of year that
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.620]   you're getting them.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.500]   And they have really good color quality.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.100]   Their autofocus is really good.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:56.020]   Um, it's, it's not better than a, than a, uh, than like a, a DSLR camera.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.440]   Cause the DSLR camera, you can change the lenses out.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.140]   So you get a different, you get a different depth of view, depth of field.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:08.060]   Um, many of us in the business world, we use the, the fake blurry backgrounds on the zoom
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.060]   videos and stuff.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   Well, this does it automatically.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.460]   And you don't get that harsh edge around your body.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.740]   It just looks natural.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.740]   It just looks natural.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.140]   It looks, it looks really nice.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.340]   So again, upping the quality of your content just by making a few small adjustments.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:28.260]   And then, um, finally like workflow, workflow tools, there's a ton of different things that
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.020]   you can do from a workflow standpoint.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.420]   Like if you're doing live streaming and you have different scenes, like, okay, I have
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.300]   a desktop scene where I'm showing my desktop with my headshot.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.060]   Cause I'm doing a presentation.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.060]   Okay.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.840]   Instead of, uh, instead of going to my, going to my, you know, streaming software and clicking
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.460]   on it, I have, I have a tablet underneath my, my monitor here, um, that runs an app
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.220]   called touch portal.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.460]   And uh, what touch portal is, it, it's basically like a giant macro.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.540]   It's like a thing that creates macros and you can, uh, set it up to run different programs.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.780]   I use it for, I use it to streamline my video editing process.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.900]   I use it to streamline my, uh, my video, uh, my audio editing process and my, and my graphics
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.740]   editing process, because I can just, I can do everything on my tablet.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.380]   Just boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.140]   And then, um, you know, having a good quality mouse, uh, that has multiple buttons on it.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.620]   I have my buttons mapped for my video editing software where, you know, I have a forward
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.660]   and back button on my thumb, my, the forward button trims everything from the play head
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.540]   to the front, and then my back button trims everything from the play head to the back.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.180]   So I'm not having to sit here and fiddle around with hot keys on my, uh, on my keyboard.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.860]   So learning, you know, getting your environment set up and getting your workflow set up is
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:49.380]   crucial and saving, you know, 30 seconds saved for every, every keystroke is, is huge or
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.580]   five seconds saved for every keystroke instead of trying to happen to fumble around with
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.280]   like control shift Z or control shift P trying to fumble around with that.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.100]   Just having a one button to click it will dramatically reduce how much time you spend
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.140]   like doing editing or anything like that.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.540]   So just having these, these workflow tools, uh, really helps and, and touch portal is
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.260]   free for, for everybody.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.340]   Um, they have a free version and they have a paid version.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.500]   There's limitations on the free version, but most people should be able to get by with
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.740]   the free version and, uh, all you need is like an iPad, iPhone, Android tablet, Android
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.740]   phone.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.580]   It works on, it works on both devices and, uh, try it.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.580]   It'll save your life, man.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.580]   Yeah.
