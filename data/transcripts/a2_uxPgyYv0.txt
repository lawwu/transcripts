[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.120]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 178.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:15.600]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   joined as usual by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.840]   Now, Jesse, do I look more tanned and relaxed?
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120]   - You look very tan.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.440]   - Given that-- - Like Mark Sisson.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.560]   - Like Mark Sisson.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.160]   I look like a 65-year-old man, like Mark Sisson.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.120]   I just got back from Mark Sisson's home stomping grounds
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   of Florida just a few days ago.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.360]   And let me tell you what the important thing was
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.280]   about that trip.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.880]   I didn't work.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.840]   All right, and that's rare for me
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.520]   because when I go on any type of vacation,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.440]   now this was a short one,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.760]   but when I go on any type of vacation,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.200]   I pretty soon get antsy.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.840]   If I don't have things to think about,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.600]   if I don't have progress to be making.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.880]   So I'm usually working on a writing problem,
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.520]   a writing project, or a math problem I'm trying to solve.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.400]   And I'll walk the beach and I'll try to make progress.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.680]   And I didn't bring anything like that.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.800]   I didn't write and I didn't try to solve anything.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.120]   I mean, I did a little writing in my head,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.720]   but I wasn't actually typing and making progress.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.480]   I wasn't trying to solve anything.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.600]   It was nice.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.120]   - How many books did you read?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.080]   - 12.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.880]   - No, one and a half, one and a half.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.360]   So, oh yeah, by the way, what are we now?
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.680]   The 25th or 6th?
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.440]   So yeah, we got another book episode.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.800]   Next time we record, we'll have books.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.840]   I will admit, so we're recording this on February 25th,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.440]   and I finished my five books in February
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.680]   early in that trip.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   So now I'm working on two books concurrently
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.440]   that I'll finish in March.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.960]   So I'm sort of on my way.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.560]   And I'm working on a really big book in the background too.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.720]   And I don't know how to report that
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.320]   because it's gonna take me,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.120]   it's an 800 page beast.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.200]   And so I just work on it a little bit at a time
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.040]   in the background.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.280]   And so it doesn't get captured in my monthly reports,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.440]   but that thing's rolling along as well.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.720]   So a lot of good reading got done.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   Saw some sun, saw some dolphins,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.360]   did not see Mark Sisson,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.280]   but it was all in all a good trip,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.240]   but not working is a big deal for me.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.640]   Just actually wrangling family and looking at the ocean
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.560]   and doing what one does.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.040]   So it was a good trip.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   - Good to hear.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.960]   So I figured we'd do a little deep dive
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.120]   and then get into some listener calls.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.480]   I was thinking this might be a good time
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.560]   to remind people, Jesse,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.120]   that if they go to calnewport.com/podcast,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.600]   there's a link on there about how to submit listener calls.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.760]   You can do it straight from your browser.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520]   It's easy to do.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.960]   And we use those and appreciate those.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.720]   We use those right in the show.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.640]   Also, I guess I should remind people,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.720]   I always forget to do this,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.400]   but YouTube page is up.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.600]   So if you want to see videos of full episodes
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.720]   or videos of each individual question and segment we do,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.320]   all of that is on the YouTube page.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.160]   We finally have our own URL.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.720]   So you don't have to just look in the show notes.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   You can just remember youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.000]   One word, right?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.840]   - Yep.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.680]   - What was the one?
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.800]   We couldn't get Cal Newport, right?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.000]   - Yeah, somebody has it, I guess.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.160]   - Yeah, it makes me nervous.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.320]   - But then when you try to go to it,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.160]   it doesn't go to anything.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.480]   - Yeah, it makes me nervous.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.040]   There's a Twitter account.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.440]   So there's been a lot of fake Cal Newport Twitter accounts
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.280]   off and on, and usually they're fine.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.480]   We had to get one taken down
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.160]   because it was getting pretty inappropriate.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.280]   It was my picture and my name, my bio.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.600]   But there's one now that's actually doing pretty well.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.480]   I think they're up to 800 followers
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.760]   that they're clear in the description, at least,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.320]   that this is not Cal Newport.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   He's not on social media.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.600]   But as far as I can tell,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.880]   the Twitter account is just my quotes.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.680]   And I think the guy's doing pretty well with it.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.080]   So there we go.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   So hopefully, youtube.com/calnewport is not that weird.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.920]   Remember we found that Professor Cal erotic ASMR guy.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.560]   Hopefully it's not gonna be that,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   with a picture of me, a big prominent picture of me,
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.360]   and just a bucket load of erotic ASMR.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.240]   It's possible, so I'll pre-warn people.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.120]   So it's Cal Newport media.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.640]   That media might end up being critical.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.800]   It could get rough, it could get dicey.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.240]   All right, but let's do a deep dive.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   So I wanted to talk about this topic
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   of tips for doing hard things.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   And what's gonna be different about this deep dive
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.400]   versus past deep dives is I'm not giving my advice
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.240]   for doing hard things.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.360]   I actually wanna relay some advice
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   that I saw in an interesting video
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.960]   that a reader sent to me from 2020
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.440]   of an author giving a talk about this topic.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.080]   And I recently wrote an essay about this talk,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.840]   and I published it in my email newsletter,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.280]   which if you don't get, you probably should.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.040]   You can sign up for that at calnewport.com.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.240]   But I figured I just wrote that this morning
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   before we started recording.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.840]   I said, I wanna talk about this on the show.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.520]   So I brought in some of my notes from it.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400]   So here's the setup.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.640]   The video is from 2020.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.920]   It's from the fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.360]   who wrote a bunch of best-selling series.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.800]   I've read some of his books.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.000]   I read "Name of the Wind" and whatever the second book was
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.680]   in that particular trilogy.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960]   And it's really good.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.400]   And I'm actually now,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.800]   one of the books I'm reading right now is,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.600]   I decided I wanted to read some Ursula K. Gwynn.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.920]   And I was going back and reading
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.760]   some of her "Earthsea Chronicles,"
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.840]   which has, that's from the '60s,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.120]   but it has some ideas about the true names
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.440]   of elements being critical to the magical system
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.160]   that Sanderson plays with.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.080]   Anyways, think big, successful fantasy novelist.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   And he gives a talk in 2020 that was titled,
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   let me have it here, "The Common Lies Writers Tell You,"
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.240]   but this was not really what the talk was about.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.960]   The talk was about doing hard things.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.400]   And Sanderson comes right out,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   and you know I'm gonna appreciate this.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.680]   He comes right out up front and says,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.080]   he dislikes the fact that the media
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.840]   keeps telling young people
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.400]   that you can do anything you want to,
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.760]   and you should follow your dreams.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.400]   And he said, "Look, that is way too simplistic.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.640]   "That's not the way it works.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.880]   "That's not gonna help anyone to say that."
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.840]   It's definitely a perspective you would hear,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.720]   for example, in my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.480]   And he says, "Okay, here is the more realistic claim."
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.200]   And I'm quoting him here.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.240]   "I can do hard things.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.480]   "Doing hard things has intrinsic value,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.880]   "and they will make me a better person,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   "even if I end up failing."
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.880]   He said, "That's the right way to talk about ambitious goals,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.600]   "is there's value in doing hard things.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   "You are able to do hard things,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.560]   "and you're gonna get value out of it,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   "no matter what actually happens,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.760]   "whether it makes you a famous novelist or not,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.440]   "or whatever that dream happens to be."
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.600]   And that this is better than telling people,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.440]   "No, of course you'll succeed,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.720]   "and you can do whatever you want."
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.880]   And then for the remainder of his talk,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.240]   he said, "So let's talk about doing hard things."
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.080]   And he gave three tips,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.400]   three tips for the reality,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.040]   reality-based tips for dealing with hard things.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.920]   So I thought what I would do here
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.880]   is I wanna go through these three tips,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.720]   I'll tell you what he said,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.820]   and then give a little bit of my own commentary on each.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:41.760]   So the first tip he gave was make better goals.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.040]   So when it comes to doing hard things,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.560]   he thinks we are not good at setting the right goals,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.520]   and we don't help people set better goals.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.600]   So he mentioned, for example,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   that in an AP literature class in high school,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.680]   he won a minor contest for a story he wrote,
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.280]   and decided, "Oh, my goal is to be a successful novelist."
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.920]   And he said that was not a good goal.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.960]   It was way too long-term, vague, and grandiose.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.840]   How do you make progress on that particular goal?
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.000]   In particular, what are you supposed to do tomorrow
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.600]   to make progress towards that goal
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.400]   and become a successful writer?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.000]   He said what you should do instead
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.240]   is make goals that you have control over.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.040]   And what Sanderson ended up doing
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.120]   was writing 13 manuscripts
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.160]   before he actually had a book he could sold,
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.680]   and he said his goal should have been focused
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.500]   on producing a certain number of manuscripts
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.000]   as an act of practice and having a commitment
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.360]   with each manuscript to be more ambitious
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.840]   than the last to push and develop his skills,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.040]   because that's a goal he could make progress on.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.480]   I could write another manuscript.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.040]   I can for sure make this next manuscript
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.160]   be even more ambitious in this way, this way, or that way.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.360]   Those are achievable goals.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   Saying, "Be a successful author," that was too vague.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.560]   All right, now my take on this
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   is I write about something similar in my book, "Deep Work."
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.000]   In that book, "Deep Work," I talk about this methodology,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.880]   this business methodology called 4DX,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.000]   the four disciplines of execution.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.800]   And I talk about how this methodology,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.080]   which was designed to help teams and companies do better,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.640]   gives us some insight into accomplishment
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.880]   when we apply it to individuals.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.240]   And one of the core ideas from that methodology
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.220]   is lead versus lag indicators.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.360]   A lag indicator is the big goal
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.600]   you eventually want to accomplish.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.660]   I want my next academic paper
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.540]   to get into a top-tier journal.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.400]   And the problem with lag indicators, according to 4DX,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.880]   is that it doesn't give you a clear action.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.640]   So they said instead,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.080]   you should focus on what they call lead indicators,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.440]   which are things you can track and do and control.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.840]   And they should be chosen such that
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.400]   if you do well with those lead indicators,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.520]   you're likely to have success with the lag indicators,
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.680]   but it gives you something concrete to focus on.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.760]   And so for that example,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.160]   the right lead indicator might be,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.480]   I'm going to do 15 hours of deep work per week
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.360]   on the paper I'm writing.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.280]   Well, that I can track.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   That creates friction I can push back against.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.080]   Now I can actually make real changes
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.200]   in the intentional application of my energy,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.480]   cancel things, move things, wake up early,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.540]   progress can happen.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.000]   So I like Sanderson's idea there,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.160]   and I've talked about variations of that.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.460]   All right, his second tip,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.240]   learn how you work.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.840]   So Sanderson, when it comes to writing,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.640]   thinks it's a real disservice
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.960]   when he hears people say things like,
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.360]   real writers have an overwhelming compulsion to write.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.320]   And that if you don't have that compulsion,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.440]   you should do anything else.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.480]   And only people who just can't help but write,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.420]   and that's all they can do,
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.000]   should be people who should be writers.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.040]   He thinks that's nonsense.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.240]   He says, writing is hard,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.440]   and it's hard work to figure out
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.520]   how to get yourself to do it.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.680]   He is a professional writer,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.600]   and I'm quoting him here,
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.680]   "I love writing,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.240]   "but I have a hard time sitting down and writing."
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.960]   So even for this very successful professional writer,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.520]   he says, writing is hard.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.280]   So his advice is, when it comes to doing hard things,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.520]   you have to put in a lot of effort
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.200]   to figure out what works for you
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.880]   to basically get yourself to do that type of effort.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.800]   And it could differ from person to person.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.280]   Sanderson uses daily word count tracking in a spreadsheet.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.320]   It's like a game for him.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   He likes that, but he says,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   other people thrive under the social pressure
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.840]   of a writer's group.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.460]   Other people need a deadline.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.880]   Now, I talk about this a lot in my own work.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.080]   I talk a lot about how deep,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.000]   cognitively demanding efforts are unnatural.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.160]   It uses a lot of energy.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.800]   More ancient parts of our brain
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.160]   cannot immediately see what benefit
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.880]   they're going to get from this energy.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.640]   What's the threat we're escaping?
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.040]   Where's the food or mate source
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.200]   that this thinking is gonna give us right away?
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.440]   And it doesn't have an answer for that.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.280]   You try to convince your brain, for example,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.100]   that your 460,000 word epic fantasy novel
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.360]   is going to help you in mate selection,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.420]   your brain's not gonna buy it.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.440]   It's gonna see that you're talking a lot about wizards
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.360]   with names like Gargamel,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.960]   who are passing wind spells on elves.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.800]   And it's gonna say,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.320]   this is not gonna get us children.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.400]   This is not gonna get us food.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.640]   Why are we doing this?
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.180]   And this is generally true
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.960]   when it comes to doing cognitively demanding work.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.600]   It's unnatural.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.000]   So a lot of effort is required
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.720]   to trick yourself into doing it.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.300]   So I like what Sanderson talked about.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.820]   I would also add scheduling philosophy and ritual.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.300]   That's why this plays such a big role.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.200]   Get rid of any decision your mind has
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.180]   about when you're gonna do this work
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.260]   instead you have a philosophy.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.240]   It's always these days at these times.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.360]   Or at the beginning of the week,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.480]   I put it on my calendar and it's right there
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.900]   in the same color as meetings I know I can't skip,
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.640]   that time is protected.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.220]   I don't always feel like I wanna go to a meeting,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.720]   but if it's on my calendar, I'd go.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.160]   I don't always feel like I wanna write,
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.360]   but it's there on my calendar,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.720]   that's what I'm doing next.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.240]   And this is also why ritual matters.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.640]   Writers will build out these spaces
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   that seem over the top or go to weird places
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.680]   like I wrote about in my New Yorker piece last summer
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.220]   about working from near home,
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.720]   where writers will leave perfectly nice and good homes
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.040]   to go to weird eccentric locations to write
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.560]   just because they associate that transit.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.380]   They associate that new environment just with writing.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.240]   That's why Peter Benchley left his bucolic carriage home
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.640]   on East Welland Avenue there.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.480]   Actually, no, he's on Curliss Avenue.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.560]   Curliss Avenue there in Pennington, New Jersey
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.200]   to work in the back room of a furnace factory.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.560]   That's why Steinbeck would balance a legal pad
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.460]   on a boat in Sag Harbor.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.800]   It's why Maya Angelou would go to hotel rooms
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.080]   and take everything off the walls
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.360]   so there is zero distraction.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.400]   And Wright laying down on the bed, propped up on an arm,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.720]   doing this so often that she built up deep calluses
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.120]   on that arm that she was supporting herself
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.880]   because it's hard to do this work.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.480]   You gotta figure out how to get your mind into there.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.200]   So scheduling philosophies and rituals,
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.520]   especially over-the-top rituals, play a big role.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.000]   And I'll say when it comes to writing, there's a quote
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.760]   I've said a few times, has bounced around a few times,
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.600]   which is basically what some people call writer's block.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.000]   By some people, I mean amateurs,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.500]   is actually just the physiological feeling
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.600]   of what writing, the writing experience is.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.920]   That feeling of I don't know what to say,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.400]   I don't feel inspired, I don't know what to say, I'm stuck.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.160]   It's like, great, now you've started writing.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.600]   That's what it feels like.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.100]   All right, Sanderson's third tip, break it down.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.120]   Maybe his most prosaic tip out of the three.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.040]   But basically, if you have a big goal,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.360]   break it into manageable pieces
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.600]   so you have something to go after.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.880]   He noted that the book he was writing at that time
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.380]   was longer than the entire Hunger Games series put together.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.160]   So he's saying that's such a big, hairy, epic goal
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   because he'll write 400,000 word plus books, which is crazy.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.500]   By comparison, my books are usually 70 to 90,000.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.920]   So it's like five deep works.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.720]   He's like, you gotta break that down.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.160]   That can't be your goal.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   I'm writing this book.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.680]   It's no, no, I'm trying to finish the chapter cycle
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.580]   that establishes the backstory for the wizard Gargamel
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.480]   that passes the wind spells on the elves, or whatever it is.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.960]   I obviously know a lot about fantasy books.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.360]   So I think that's good work.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.800]   I think the key part about this final tip
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.720]   is that he says in figuring out what those goals are,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.400]   that's where all the magic happens,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.480]   is that we don't give people enough training,
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.560]   especially in creative fields,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.600]   to figure out what those smaller goals are.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.460]   He said this is a particular problem in writing
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.520]   where if you talk to a professional writer and say,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.960]   look, I really wanna do what you do, what's your advice?
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.200]   They'll just look at you and say, well, you gotta write.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.560]   He says, that's too vague.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.000]   No, no, what you need to tell me is
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.040]   it's gonna take about six manuscripts
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.360]   before you get your chops down.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   And those manuscripts have to be
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.200]   successively harder in this way.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.600]   And here is the level, type, and source of feedback
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.720]   you need on each to make sure
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.160]   that you're gaining particular skills.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.720]   You do one on your own.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.880]   You do one with two with a writing group.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.840]   For the fourth, maybe you wanna hire an editor
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.360]   a day of their time to come back and give you a harsher.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.340]   The fifth, you wanna submit and get notes
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.360]   from the publisher that you submit to.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.400]   We need that type of detailed roadmap.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.160]   It's non-trivial and it's non-obvious.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.960]   You don't just tell people, if you wanna write, write.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.040]   If you wanna be a musician, play music.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.280]   You wanna be an artist, paint.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.640]   No, these are big, hairy goals that you need to break down
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.080]   and it's not obvious how they break down.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.880]   And the thing I talk about a lot
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.600]   on this show in particular
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.240]   is that if you're going to get this information,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.940]   you have to go get it.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.600]   And by what I mean by that is you have to go to people
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.760]   who know what they're doing
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.280]   and don't just say, what's your advice?
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.740]   Because they'll just say, write.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.940]   They'll just say, paint.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.480]   Say, I wanna hear your story.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.080]   How did you get there?
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:18.920]   What was the first thing?
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.740]   Then what was the next thing?
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.560]   Oh, oh, Sanderson, you wrote 13 manuscripts?
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.600]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.240]   So you mean I can't just do National Novel Writing Month
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.520]   and have the name of the win be the book that comes out of it?
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.860]   Oh, okay, now I get that.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.400]   I don't like that that's reality, but that's reality.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.560]   Okay, I have to write 13 manuscripts.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.720]   How long is that gonna take?
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.600]   You know, maybe I'm gonna need much more time on this
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.440]   than I think.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   You get the reality, not what you wanna be true.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.480]   You get the reality of what actually matters
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   for the endeavor you wanna do.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.800]   You get that reality from people who came before.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.840]   Not by asking for advice, but asking for their story.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.200]   You look at that and you find out what really matters.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.160]   I talked about this.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.560]   If you wanna see a more extensive conversation about this,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.320]   when I was on the Tim Ferriss podcast earlier
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.140]   in, whenever this was, January, I guess I was
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.320]   on his podcast, we get into how I got started in writing.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.760]   And I go into detail of the story about how,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.940]   through connections with my family,
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.680]   I got in touch with an agent, a literary agent,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.760]   who I promised, I'm not gonna try to sell you a book.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.840]   And I had that agent walk me through step by step
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.960]   what exactly would a 20-year-old need to do
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.760]   to get a book deal with a major publisher.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.360]   And she walked me through, here's what matters,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.240]   here's what doesn't, here's the process, here's the steps.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.720]   And it was not at all what I would have guessed,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.840]   and it's not at all what most young people I've met
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.880]   who say, I wanna write a book do, but it was the reality.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.240]   And it took me two years, but I followed that plan
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.800]   and sold that book and wrote that book as a senior
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.400]   and everything else unfolded from there.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   So that's my advice there is, yes,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.520]   you need to break down your goals
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   into more manageable goals.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.640]   It's not always obvious how to do that.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.320]   Ask the experts, but not for their advice,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.240]   but for their story, and you can extract from their story
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.520]   the reality of what matters.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.300]   All right, so Sanderson, thank you for giving that talk.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.920]   Excuse me for my wizard elf jokes.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.720]   Obviously, you're very good at what you do
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.220]   and I am of great awe, but that's good advice.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   Don't just follow your dreams.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.640]   Focus on doing hard things for the meaning
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.560]   of doing hard things and treat doing hard things
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.320]   like a complicated endeavor that requires
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.420]   a lot of nuanced feedback.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.800]   There we go.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.300]   Are you a fantasy guy, Jesse?
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.280]   - Yeah, yeah, I am.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.680]   - Do you read fantasy books?
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.800]   - I read a lot of science fiction right now.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.640]   - Oh, I see.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.960]   I feel like I should be more into fantasy.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.480]   And I've read some, like the classics,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.140]   but I think I should be a huge fantasy fan
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.000]   just given my demographics.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.120]   It's like a semi-nerdy, computer science, whatever,
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.000]   guy who reads a lot.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.400]   And I don't know, I lose steam.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.240]   But I've read the classics.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   I've done "The Lord of the Rings."
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.000]   I'm doing Ursula Gwynn's "Earthsea Cycle."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.160]   Oh, I'm reading at least the first one.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   Just why not?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.800]   I like "Name of the Wind,"
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.600]   so I like Brandon Sanderson's book.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.760]   I mean, man, it's long.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.120]   But I like that.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.480]   But I've tried a lot of other things that I've just,
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.320]   I don't know, I can't get in.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.800]   I tried Robert Jordan.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.400]   - How is "Lord of the Rings?"
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.380]   - I reread that again at some point, and it's cool.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.560]   It's written in a mythological meter,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.620]   if that makes sense, right?
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.440]   So he writes it almost like you're reading,
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.340]   because he's an expert in Old English,
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.160]   like it's mythological,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.080]   where now things are more boldly expository.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.400]   Like I'm the third-person observer
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.640]   just explaining everything that's happening.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.920]   But this had a more,
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.600]   especially the first "Lord of the Rings" book,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.400]   I don't know, there's more of a mythological
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.040]   than I remembered meter to it.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.600]   The language is a little chewy.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.320]   It kind of sets the scene,
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.920]   and it's not all just pure action,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.500]   and sometimes the description feels more mythological
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.920]   than modern, just objective description of what's happening.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   So it's a very impressive, very impressive book.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.840]   - Did you like the movies?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.880]   - I kind of get bored in the movies.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.280]   I don't know, do you like them?
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.120]   - I did, yeah.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.960]   - Yeah, I just, that's my memory.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.440]   I re-watched some of them recently.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.200]   It's my memory in the theater was getting a little antsy.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   Here's my, okay, here's the "Lord of the Rings" question
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.400]   about the movies,
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.840]   because no one else seems to agree with this.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.280]   But to me, and this is probably unavoidable
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.800]   because of budgets,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.540]   the world seems so uninhabited.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.400]   It's all just empty fields and mountains,
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.560]   and then they'll eventually come to a city with a king,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.760]   but it'll be 70 people in the middle,
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.520]   like a giant empty field or this or that.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.880]   It just feels like there's no people in that world.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.500]   And so is that supposed to be
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.600]   because after ancient warfare,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.920]   it's largely depopulated,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.440]   or it's just a very sparsely populated country?
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.000]   But nowhere in the "Lord of the Rings" universe,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.200]   in the visual movie universe,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.120]   you ever have this feel of medieval England or something,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.900]   where there's big cities and villages and stuff.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.740]   It's just, everything is so empty.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.300]   - Was it that way in the books?
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.780]   - You know, I'm trying to remember.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.320]   I don't remember.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.220]   It's a good question.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.660]   I mean, I think the,
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.660]   I read a book about "Lord of the Rings."
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.100]   This part, a couple of years ago,
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.300]   I read a book about the making of the movies.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.940]   That was actually kind of an interesting book.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.580]   Like what, everything that went through,
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.340]   like the movie rights and how Peter Jackson got them
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.340]   and how they filmed it and where they found it.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.580]   Like, to me, that was actually more interesting.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.020]   And I think the reality is like,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.780]   they can't afford to,
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.180]   you can't make medieval England.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.860]   It's just too many people.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.940]   So it's easier for it to be sparsely populated.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.780]   - Yeah.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.500]   - But let's add this to our list of directions
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.900]   for us not to go with this podcast.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.300]   Next to, we had from last week,
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.460]   becoming like a hardcore sports talk radio show,
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.340]   but the premise is I know nothing about sports,
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.940]   but I'm very enthusiastic about it.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.860]   And like Pat McAfee,
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.300]   where a tank top and stand up and yell,
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.900]   but know nothing about sports.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.900]   And then two, let's not become a like hardcore fantasy
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.740]   discussion podcast.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.940]   This is gonna be a lot of like, I don't know.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.940]   I didn't like it.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.500]   I didn't read it.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.340]   I don't know.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.100]   Those are on the list.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.220]   Our list is growing, Josie.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.880]   Our list of things we should not try to discuss
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.820]   on this show is,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.140]   is growing, growing with each week.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.500]   Fantasy book reviews with Cal and Jessie.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.360]   Like, oh no, seems kind of nerdy.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.900]   What's next?
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.820]   We out of here in like a crisp five minutes.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.760]   Oh man.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.600]   All right.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.180]   Well, we have calls, call an episode,
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.020]   looking forward to it.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.220]   But as always, let's talk about this week's sponsors.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.620]   And we'll start with Blinkist,
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.740]   longtime friend of the show.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.620]   You heard me talking about them in Monday's episode,
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.980]   the subscription service in which you can get these 10 to 15
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.560]   minutes summaries of thousands of the best,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.820]   most important nonfiction titles that are out there.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.460]   If you want to know what this book is about 10 to 15 minutes
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.300]   later, you will have that information.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.620]   I recommend that people use Blinkist to help learn about
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.500]   ideas and figure out which of many books written on a topic
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.420]   they should read.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.620]   I like that idea.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.780]   Jessie, let me put you on the spot here.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.220]   You have your computer there.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.940]   Let's go to Blinkist.com.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.380]   Let's see what's popular.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.400]   So what's popular right now.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.780]   So we can get a sense of what it would be like,
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.540]   what value you could get out of Blinkist.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.740]   If like me, you're curious about books and curious about the
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.020]   world of ideas.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.120]   And so we're doing this unprompted.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.960]   All right.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.300]   So if we go to Blinkist.com, what do we,
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.260]   what books are they showing there that are popular?
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.660]   Now this is where Jesse should lie and say,
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.580]   deep work, digital minimalism, a world without email,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.900]   or in a category at the top called can't miss modern
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.380]   classics, deep work, digital minimalism,
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.220]   a world without email, the Bible.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.060]   Those are in their own box, but be under that box,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   Jesse, what do we got?
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.220]   - Well, I actually just signed up for my Blinkist account
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.300]   last week.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.060]   So on a different computer.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.340]   So when I'm going to this one, it's making me sign in.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.180]   - Oh, it's about you.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.780]   - So then I need to get my password.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.980]   - Well, what's the first blink?
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.880]   What's the first blink you considered?
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.700]   Once you signed up for Blinkist.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.340]   - I read, what'd I read?
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.360]   I read two of them earlier this week.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.060]   There were a couple of like philosophy things.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.260]   What was the name of it?
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.940]   - Philosophy is a good topic for Blinkist, right?
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.660]   Because it's, let me see what this is
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.120]   before I get into the book.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.320]   - Yeah.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.160]   Well, let me ask you this though,
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.200]   for either of those two philosophy books you read blinks on,
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.720]   did either of them then pass the bar of like,
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.600]   I should buy this or were they both like,
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.040]   I know what I need to know from this book
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.120]   and I'm kind of glad I did it.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.320]   - The cool thing with that is I have a Scribd account.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.560]   Do you know what Scribd, you might have.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.400]   - Yeah.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.560]   - Yeah, I think Ryan Holiday talked about it.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.880]   So it's like $10 a month for books.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.560]   So I just, I went to the Blink and then added to the Scribd.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.280]   - That's a good one to punch right there.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.920]   Yeah, so then you can dive in.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.560]   All right, so Jesse has invented,
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.920]   I think a really good one to punch there.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.200]   So now you can really,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.000]   you can move quickly through a lot of blinks
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.160]   and then Scribd the things that catch your attention.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.440]   And then the things that really last after that,
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.840]   you can put it into your library
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.720]   if you really want to get into it.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.320]   - The other thing, cool thing with the Blinkist
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.000]   is you can listen to the audio.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.040]   - Yeah, so you can listen or read now, right?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.880]   - Yeah.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.960]   - Yeah, I like the listen option.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.520]   Yeah, the listen option is great because in my commute,
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.920]   it's about 35 minutes to no problem.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.000]   Yeah, no, I like to listen.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.800]   So there you go.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.960]   So Blinkist, use it to get that information quickly
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.320]   about what some of these books are about.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.880]   So you can figure out the lay of the land
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.640]   and decide if you want to read further.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.200]   The good news is right now Blinkist has a special offer
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.640]   just for our audience.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.720]   If you go to Blinkist.com/deep

[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   So that's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,

[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.520]   and a seven-day free trial, Blinkist.com/deep.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.120]   Let me talk about one other sponsor.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.640]   Now, Jesse, this is an absolute true story.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.440]   And I think you'll recognize when you hear it
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.240]   that it's an absolute true story.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.640]   Not long ago, I decided,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.840]   I think I might be missing some nutrients that I might need,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.000]   some minerals I might need.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.800]   So I'm gonna go to GNC and I'm gonna get pills.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.960]   I'll go talk to them in that store.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.400]   And I walked in the GNC and I was kind of confused
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.920]   because there's all these different things
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.040]   and all these different pills
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.120]   and all these cardboard cutouts of like weird,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.320]   scary people that do these extreme sports.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.120]   And the staff at GNC ran up
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   and they beat me with crates of Jocko fuel.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.600]   Beat me with them because they could tell
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.680]   that I did not know my way around that store.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.320]   They beat me with crates of whatever.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.080]   And that's when I discovered,
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.760]   this is an absolutely true story,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.080]   as they drew me out the door to the gutter,
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.480]   I saw going by in the gutter,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.960]   in the water going towards a drain,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.960]   there was a travel pack wrapper from Athletic Greens.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.640]   So I said, "I gotta find out more about this."
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.720]   Right here, I'm bloodied in there.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.560]   I gotta find out.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.400]   And here I am in the gutter bleeding.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.280]   Take out my phone, let me look up Athletic Greens.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.120]   Absolute true story.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.960]   I think everyone will recognize
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.400]   when they hear this, it's absolutely true.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.680]   And that's when I found out, oh, this is what I need.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.120]   Athletic Greens is a company that says,
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.040]   "We will do all that work for you
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.360]   of figuring out the things that you need to be healthy."
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.040]   The vitamins, the minerals, the probiotics, the adaptogens.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.280]   And we do nothing, this is the company talking here,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.040]   we do nothing but obsess about getting the highest quality,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.280]   most ingestible forms of these things.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.880]   They put it all into one product,
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.320]   they only do one product,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.960]   their AG1 Green Athletic Greens powder.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.320]   It gets shipped to you in the mail.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.440]   You don't have to go into GNC.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.000]   And you put it in cold water,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.680]   mix it up, drink it every morning.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.640]   75 high quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.120]   whole food source superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.720]   You do that once a day,
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.640]   you know they've got the right stuff.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.280]   You know they've been thinking about it.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.080]   You know they keep improving this one product.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.000]   And then you don't have to worry about this anymore.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.200]   So after I healed, and you know, again, true story,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.280]   it took me 14 months in the hospital.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.080]   But after I healed,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.040]   I picked up my habit of athletic greens every morning.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.760]   Which actually that part is true.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.960]   I do take my athletic greens every morning.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.120]   They convinced me when I talked to them.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.800]   So that is how I came across athletic greens.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.840]   But if you wanna make sure
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.800]   you're getting all the right stuff,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.120]   just do the AG every morning.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.800]   Problem solved.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.640]   Good news, to make it easy for you to sign up,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.600]   athletic greens is gonna give you free
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.240]   a one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.640]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.040]   I definitely do the vitamin D.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.920]   You have to add it separately with a dropper
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.720]   because again, they are obsessed with,
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   if it's not gonna work, we don't want it.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.120]   And they figured out the vitamin D can't be in powder form.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.640]   It needs to be mixed with vitamin K
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.440]   and an olive oil suspension if it's gonna work.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.280]   So you have to add that.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   And I add it every morning
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.840]   'cause it's cold and flu season.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.640]   And I have three young kids
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.920]   in three different congregate settings every day,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.840]   which means I get roughly 17 colds a week.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.200]   I believe my kids are probably the source
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.680]   of the evolution of COVID
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.280]   because there are so many coronaviruses going back and forth.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.120]   So I care about this.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.000]   So I take my vitamin D.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.240]   So you get your vitamin D
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.440]   and you get five free travel packs.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.320]   So when you travel, like when I went to Florida,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.400]   you can bring it pre-portion.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.240]   And all you have to do
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.480]   is visit athleticgreens.com/deep.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.920]   Again, this is athleticgreens.com/deep
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.880]   to take ownership over your health,
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.440]   to pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.720]   and to avoid savage, savage beatings
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.200]   at the hands of people in the physical supplement stores
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.880]   where you will have to go if you don't use Athletic Greens.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.520]   True story.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.880]   I've told you that story before, right, Jesse?
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.840]   - I've heard it, yeah.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.540]   - Yeah, that's why I have the limp.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.300]   (Jesse laughs)
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.140]   That's why I have the limp.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.220]   All right, let's do some calls.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.460]   All right, so what are we starting off with today?
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.420]   - All right, so we got a call.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.100]   The first call is basically about
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.900]   the different types of people
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.280]   and how they go about planning.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.380]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.140]   My name is Johan van der Putte.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.140]   I'm a Belgian psychologist.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.840]   And I've been thinking that there's probably a continuum.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.260]   At one end of it,
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.300]   you have people who are skilled at planning
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.860]   or they have become skilled at it.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.880]   And then you have people who, a bit like me,
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.400]   aren't so skilled at it.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:23.580]   I guess planning involves dividing up life into tasks
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:30.100]   and then allocating these tasks to pockets of time.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:36.300]   I guess it requires some spatial skill.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.540]   I think I'm not very good at it.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.460]   It is hard for me to do.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.580]   And it makes me sometimes stressed
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.280]   and a bit anxious when I try to do it.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.740]   You have any suggestions of how people
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.980]   who maybe aren't so talented at it,
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   how they could move in this direction
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.820]   without attempting to become very good planners
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:15.340]   in the short time?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.180]   Thank you.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.980]   - Well, I think it's an important question.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.340]   And I am gonna give you
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.420]   what I think of as planning baby steps,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.980]   like a way to ease yourself into something
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.260]   that looks more like my time management philosophy.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.860]   And for those who are interested about that,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.900]   we did a core idea video
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.380]   about my time management philosophy
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.380]   that you can find at the YouTube.com/CalNewportMedia
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.700]   YouTube page.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.700]   You can find that core idea video on time management.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.940]   So I do have some baby steps to help you get into that.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.860]   But let me just first emphasize that, yes,
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.760]   planning is anxiety producing.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.540]   And that that shouldn't come across if this happens to you.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.460]   Should not come across as if there's something wrong.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.620]   It's just the reality of planning
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.740]   is that it's anxiety producing.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.220]   And the reason is, is because you are confronting,
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.380]   you are confronting this typically too large stack
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.700]   of things that you have been committed to doing.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.060]   You can't easily imagine how they're gonna get done.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.060]   The planning centers of your brain short circuit
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.700]   when they're faced with this type of overload scenario,
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   that short circuiting causes anxiety.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   I'm simplifying this.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.860]   There's a lot of other things going on,
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.260]   but that's a simplified way
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.380]   of understanding what's happening.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.380]   So in particular, when you do weekly planning,
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.740]   this is my experience.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.060]   When I am looking over all of my to-do lists,
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.300]   when I'm looking over my calendar,
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.860]   when I'm looking over my strategic plans
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.780]   and I'm trying to figure out
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.280]   what am I gonna do this week?
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.900]   I get very anxious.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.740]   It is a natural reaction.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:48.900]   It's similar to having your heart rate increase
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.940]   when you're running on a treadmill.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.820]   So don't fear that.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.200]   Don't think that's a problem.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.220]   That anxiety then fades once you're done planning.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.940]   When you go day to day and do your daily time block planning
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.820]   if you follow my system, that's much less stressful.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.820]   'Cause now your weekly plan
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.460]   has already confronted the productivity dragon.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.960]   It's already confronted the short circuit inducing
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:12.140]   overload of tasks and come up with an idea for your week
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.180]   that makes sense.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.060]   And now you can just look at that idea for your week
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.380]   when you do your daily planning, it should be less stressful.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.220]   So let's start with that.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.740]   It is supposed to cause anxiety.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.180]   Now, what I'm gonna suggest is for your baby steps
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.180]   is essentially have low granularity plans.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.760]   Plans that don't get into a lot of detail,
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.540]   but are more structured than just what's next to my inbox.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.100]   What do I feel like doing next?
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.340]   So if we're talking about daily planning,
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.660]   I want you to do some time blocking.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.040]   This is when I'm working.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.060]   When I'm working, I wanna have some say in advance
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.800]   about what I wanna do with my time.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.200]   Get you out of the mindset of the list reactive method
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.020]   where you just react to things that come in
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.700]   and occasionally glance at to-do lists.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.380]   But to get started with time blocking,
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.060]   make your time blocks very large and quite generic.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.700]   Here are my meetings.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.500]   Well, I might as well copy those down
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.720]   into my time block plan.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.340]   Let me take this big chunk of time here,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.540]   not get too specific about it, but just say,
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.360]   catch up on email and small tasks.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.240]   And let me just find one block in that day
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.100]   I'm gonna say work on something specific.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.580]   All right, this is where I'm gonna work on that report.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.420]   And any other time you might just say,
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.380]   whatever, email and small tasks.
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.540]   So like when you're starting off,
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.260]   you're really trying to have maybe one block each day
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.420]   where you specifically say,
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.540]   even though it's not on my calendar,
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.220]   even though no one's forcing me to do it,
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.460]   even though I might wanna do something else,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.980]   I'm gonna work on a long-term cognitively demanding task
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.820]   during that time.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.100]   And the rest is like by default, like let's do,
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.540]   you know, shallows, let's do email, let's do tasks.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.860]   Then you might get a little bit better.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.880]   The way you get a little bit better
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.540]   is add in a focused admin blocks.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.380]   You do this for a couple of weeks.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.700]   Now you say this block right here,
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.260]   I'm gonna go run those errands.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.340]   You know, I have an hour between this meeting
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.580]   and this meeting, so I'm gonna eat lunch
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.700]   and then I'm gonna swing by the drug store and the bank.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.900]   So now you're getting used to like,
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.140]   let me be a little bit more conscientious about admin,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.660]   certain times being better for certain tasks.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.360]   And then just do that for a while.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.860]   I have a simple time block plan.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.140]   There's like one big block in there somewhere
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.860]   for focusing on something deeply.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.660]   There's one block in there
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.420]   for like a specific type of admin task
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.060]   and everything else is like, whatever,
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.980]   let's react of email, looking at to-do list.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.420]   You'll just get used to that after a while.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.700]   And then you can begin to add more granularity.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.420]   And I get into a lot of details about this
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.140]   in the front of my time block planner in particular,
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.140]   I actually have a chapter all about,
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.160]   there's like a book chapter at the front of my planner.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.260]   That's just all about the mechanics of doing time blocking
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.900]   at a much higher level of detail
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.620]   and getting really good at it.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.260]   So you can find out about that planner
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.620]   at timeblockplanner.com.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.580]   And I really get into it, but that's how I would start.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.340]   And the same thing with your weekly plan,
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.820]   do a weekly plan and feel the anxiety
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.940]   and trust that's gonna go away,
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.700]   but you can make that weekly plan kind of bad at first.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:09.380]   You know, it's like, I'm looking at my calendar,
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.580]   you know, let me just write down a few notes about this week.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.940]   Like I need to get started this week on this report
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.780]   that's doing two weeks,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.420]   because next week is busy or something like this.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.740]   Or Friday is gonna be a good day
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.580]   for catching up on something.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.900]   Like just make a couple decisions
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.780]   and maybe have a reminder for some habits.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.180]   Like don't do anything that complicated,
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.700]   but get in the habit of doing it.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.860]   And that's the main advice I'm gonna give here
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.320]   is the binary from doing none of this planning
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   to doing some of this planning bad is the key binary.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.440]   That's the hard shift.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.080]   I do a weekly plan.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.980]   I don't care if it's terrible, I do it.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.280]   I do a daily time block plan.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.380]   I don't care if it's pretty terrible.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.300]   There's only a few meaningful blocks, I do it.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.460]   That's the shift that matters.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.620]   Going from that to doing those things well,
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.200]   that'll come later, it's not too hard.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.100]   You'll get used to it.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.060]   You'll feel that impulse.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.100]   Like after you've done this for a while,
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.900]   like, well, I might as well make this better.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.220]   That's not a big deal.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.420]   It's going from zero to one.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.900]   That's the flip that's gonna matter.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.300]   And don't mind, again,
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.260]   don't mind that anxiety around weekly plans.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.260]   That's just your brain doing
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.100]   what your brain is supposed to do.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.140]   So let's say, I don't know how much I can talk about it,
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.580]   Jesse, but we are deep in discussions
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.100]   about version 2.0 of my time block planner
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.620]   and what it's gonna be like.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.900]   I have a lot of upgrades in mind
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.140]   because as I told people, like if you,
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.520]   the time block planner, you're not buying a single thing.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.880]   You're buying into a system because, you know,
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.780]   you have to get new ones when it fills up.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.140]   And like over time, it's gonna keep improving.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.940]   And probably the longest cycle of improvement
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   is this one we just went through
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.180]   because we printed a bunch up front.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.820]   So it's like, okay, until we sell,
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.260]   we have to sell the ones we have before we do new ones.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.860]   And we've done that.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.560]   So now we're working on the next one.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.180]   And as we print them in smaller batches,
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.500]   making tweaks going forward will be cool.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.140]   So I can't talk about any specifics yet
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.900]   because I gotta tell you,
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.140]   in a global supply chain crisis moment,
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.180]   it's surprisingly hard to design
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.720]   new paper product type things,
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.100]   stuff you wouldn't even think about
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.900]   being potentially scarce, like glue can be.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.760]   So it's been a bit of a journey,
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.100]   but I should have announcements to make soon
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.180]   about new and improved time block planners.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.260]   - Exciting stuff.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.020]   - Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.860]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.440]   Let's move on.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.280]   What do we got?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.220]   - Okay, moving on here.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.000]   We got a question.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.580]   Basically, he has a question about,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.540]   he thinks your mom might be a computer scientist and she--
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.060]   - She was a computer programmer.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.660]   - Okay, so he's got a question about that
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.980]   and types of values she instilled in you.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.260]   All right.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.460]   - Hey, Cal, this is Michael from Falls Church, Virginia.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   I recently read in one of the magazine articles of yours,
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.980]   I think it was in New Yorker,
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.820]   you said your mother was a computer scientist.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.380]   So I can imagine she must have instilled some values
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.940]   and habits into you that are different
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.020]   from most mothers your generation growing up.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.020]   Could you possibly share some of these values
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.060]   and habits that she instilled in you
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.460]   that helped shape who you are today?
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.060]   Thanks, and I hope to see you at an in-person event
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.980]   or a talk or a bookstore around DC one of these days.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.860]   - Well, yeah, first of all, to your second point,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.900]   yes, we should hope to see you in person at some point
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.260]   once Jesse and I get our act together
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.100]   to organize something.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.100]   Falls Church is not too far from here,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.260]   so that would be great.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.680]   Yeah, so my mom.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.900]   The article you're talking about was an article
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.020]   I wrote early in the pandemic about remote work.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.340]   She wasn't a computer scientist,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.860]   she was a computer programmer, COBOL programmer
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.420]   on series seven IBM mainframes for the Houston Chronicle
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.700]   back when we was born and raised in Texas.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:51.740]   And so, yes, so I talked about in that article
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.060]   the fact that she was one of the first remote workers
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.660]   and they had set up a terminal,
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.820]   but that's important for your question
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.200]   because what it meant was is we had computers,
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.300]   personal computers in our house in the '80s
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.560]   at a relatively early period,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.180]   because again, as a very early remote worker,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.820]   she had a personal computer that she could connect
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.960]   into the mainframe and program from home there in Houston.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.880]   So we had computers in our house at a very early age.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.380]   So that had an impact on my interest in computers
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.220]   and eventually in computer science
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.660]   because I could ask her what she's doing
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.180]   and she'd tell me what computer programming was.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.500]   I knew what computer programming was.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.580]   We had computers in the house.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.620]   So at a pretty early age, I started computer programming.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.380]   And I got pretty deeply into that
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.420]   and that set up my whole computer science career.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.420]   Of course, ironically, as soon as I got to MIT
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.380]   in grad school, I said, "I'm done with computer programming.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.380]   "I want to be a theoretician."
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.620]   And I haven't programmed a computer since, more or less,
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.940]   but that was very useful.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.140]   The other influence here, and I'm going to say right now,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.460]   I'm just focusing on influences relevant
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.120]   to my public professional life.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.500]   Obviously, there's very important influences on my values
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.700]   and me as a person and character,
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.740]   but I don't want to get into all of that right now.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.700]   But in terms of things that are publicly visible
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.940]   in my professional life, the other important thing
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.760]   that I got out of my mom is that when we moved,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.020]   we moved to New Jersey, and I have three siblings,
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.860]   so there's four of us.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.500]   And we moved to New Jersey,
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.340]   she stopped working for the Houston Chronicle
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.060]   and was just helping to raise the kids
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.820]   because we were at an age where it's four kids.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.980]   It's a really hard job.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.820]   And we generated a lot of chaos.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.860]   There's a lot of paperwork and things that happen
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.700]   when you move.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.300]   And my memory was it was quite overwhelming
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:44.140]   until one of her friends sold her on a Franklin Planner.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.420]   It was like the Franklin Planner
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.740]   is a productivity organizational system
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.780]   that was in particular quite popular in the '80s and '90s.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.000]   And she got very organized,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.460]   and it made all the difference in the world.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.660]   And it went from chaos, like a completely organized household
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.600]   to completely organized childhood
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.260]   in a way that was very impressive and very comforting.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.020]   So I had been exposed all throughout my childhood
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.620]   to the power of being structured and organized
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.060]   in terms of your calendar, your to-do list,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.220]   your days, your plan for what should happen.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.660]   There's a lot of ideas
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.180]   from that original Franklin Covey system
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.060]   that permeate the time management systems
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.380]   I talk about today.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.540]   Looking to the week ahead,
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.660]   figuring out in advance when things were gonna happen,
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.980]   full capture of things.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.880]   You had all the information in place.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.320]   Avoiding the chaos of what do I wanna do next,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.600]   and instead having the structure
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.740]   of what's my plan for the day.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.000]   A lot of that I saw happening as we were growing up,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.600]   and it meant a very stable, structured household.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.120]   Oh, it's this holiday happening,
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.720]   those decorations come out,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.400]   there's these events we do,
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.960]   everyone gets their, we gotta get clothes for the kids.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.040]   That was a big thing,
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.760]   because you grow out of your clothes so fast.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.720]   And my mom would bring down the catalogs,
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.800]   be like, "Okay, you have to go through
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.040]   "and circle what you want."
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.160]   And there would be the day she called and ordered it.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.140]   And that, I think I took to heart for sure.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.380]   And that would lead me to be someone
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.780]   that had productivity and productivity systems
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.860]   instilled in my DNA.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.660]   So those are my two things I will say
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.200]   in terms of my mom's influence
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   on my public professional visible lifestyle.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.860]   Me as a computer scientist,
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.780]   and me as someone that does some productivity guru-ing,
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.100]   that goes back to her.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.500]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:34.740]   All right, what do we have next?
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.340]   - Okay, our next question is about weekend planning.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.580]   - Weekend planning, okay.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:45.020]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Lucia,
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.960]   I'm a law student from Spain.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.460]   Thank you for your writing on your student advice,
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.140]   it has helped me a lot.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.520]   My question is this,
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.020]   you recommend that people don't time block their weekends
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.860]   because it may lead to burnout.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.580]   However, we students often need to work on weekends
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.860]   in order to live up to the study load.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.220]   How do you recommend that we approach weekend planning?
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.320]   Thank you so much.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.220]   - For a student, what I would rely on
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.820]   is my autopilot schedule philosophy,
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:19.060]   which is where you figure out all the work
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.600]   that regularly needs to be done,
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.660]   and you get the days and times
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.340]   in which that work is actually accomplished.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.340]   So I always use whatever,
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.500]   Thursday mornings is when I do the problem set
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.540]   that's due on Friday,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   and I do my lab write up right after my lab on Monday.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.580]   I have a two hour window
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.420]   where I just stay in the science library right there,
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.740]   and I do the lab write up that's due every week.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.500]   And so you just have fixed on your schedule,
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.220]   here's the times when this work gets done,
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.060]   this work I know that always has to happen.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.700]   So that gives you a realistic vision of
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.100]   how much do I really have to do,
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.460]   and where does it fit?
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.760]   And now if you're already filling that up,
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.460]   autopilot the weekends.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.300]   So you might have autopilot things scheduled
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.340]   on the weekends, right?
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.780]   So I don't have to think about it,
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.900]   I'm working on the weekend,
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   but I don't have to think about when or how I do it,
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.500]   this is just what I do on Sunday afternoon,
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.900]   this is what I do on Saturday morning.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.060]   So when you're building your autopilot schedule as a student,
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.940]   feel free to just use the weekends as well.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.660]   And this is different than time blocking,
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.580]   autopilot scheduling is different than time blocking
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.460]   because you just get used to,
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.020]   I always do this work on this point,
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.660]   and that's very different than
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.500]   I'm wrangling a whole day,
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.940]   beat by beat what I'm doing,
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.980]   I have to keep turning my attention
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.820]   from one thing to another,
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.240]   a complicated, intricate schedule
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.420]   where you're locked in until you're done.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.520]   Now on the weekend, it's like, look,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.500]   I do Sunday mornings and Saturday afternoons,
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.060]   I just always do that, I go to the library,
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.180]   I don't have to think about it,
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.540]   it's not gonna burn you out the same way.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.320]   So you write the note that students often
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.720]   do make use of the weekends,
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.140]   but let your autopilot schedule do a lot of that work.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.700]   Now, what about the one-time things, papers and exams,
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.180]   studying for exams, writing papers?
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.740]   For that, what I used to recommend in my books on this,
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.380]   and also my writing on the Study Hacks blog,
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:02.220]   is that you are going to create a plan
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:06.740]   for prep and execution for these one-time big things
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.540]   at least a month in advance.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.180]   And you figure out what really needs to be done
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.580]   to study for an exam,
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.420]   what is gonna be involved in writing this paper?
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.680]   And you get that work onto your calendar far in advance.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.820]   And I would even suggest,
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.140]   when I used to talk about this to students,
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.260]   I would say at the beginning of every semester,
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.980]   go through your syllabus for each class,
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.540]   find a major one-time things,
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.700]   find the exams, find the papers,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.300]   go back one month from each
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.780]   and put a note on your calendar that says,
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.260]   make a plan for this.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.460]   So you do that at the beginning of the semester.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.580]   Now, as you're going through your semester,
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.780]   execute your autopilot schedule, everything's fine,
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.180]   you're not time blocking every minute of your day,
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.300]   you're just executing the schedule
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.660]   that's the same every day, every week.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.940]   And when you get to this note that says,
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.260]   hey, time to start thinking about the midterm,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.440]   then you make a plan and you put that work on your calendar
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.520]   like doctor's appointments or other classes.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.200]   And now you're back to just them executing.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.280]   Autopilot schedule, oh, my autopilot schedule,
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.720]   plus today I have a block of time on my calendar,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.880]   so let me do that.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.480]   Oh, today I only have it Saturday,
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.360]   I have my Saturday afternoon
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.440]   where I always work on my CS problem set,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.280]   but you know what?
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.440]   This Saturday I have a study session in the morning
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.840]   on my calendar because I have a midterm coming up,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.160]   so let me just do that too.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.380]   And when you're starting a month out
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.660]   and really spreading this stuff out,
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.580]   what you avoid is this thing is due on Monday,
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:26.780]   it's Saturday morning,
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.580]   I now have to work all day and all night
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.260]   and all day the next day and all day the next night
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.180]   to try to get something done
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:32.260]   because you're spreading work out,
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.380]   so you have plenty of breathing time,
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.740]   plenty of time to recharge.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.700]   And it does not feel the same.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.420]   An autopilot schedule augmented
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.540]   with these pre-planned sessions for papers and exams
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.380]   does not feel the same as let's say my situation
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.020]   where I will say, okay, I have eight hours I'm working today
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.340]   and I need to get everything out of those minutes.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.180]   Let's go.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.840]   Because as a student,
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.680]   you do not have that chronic overload issue
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.580]   of people are just piling work on you,
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.420]   you have more on your plate
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.820]   than you could ever imagine actually doing.
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.360]   No, you can actually wrap your arms
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   around your work as a student.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.000]   You autopilot schedule the regular stuff,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.720]   you pre-plan the one-time stuff.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.160]   If that's too crowded, get an easier schedule,
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.540]   make sure you don't have too many extracurriculars,
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.000]   you can control this.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.680]   And it's not gonna be nearly as stressful
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.560]   as time-block planning,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.060]   even if this work is happening on weekdays and weekends.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.380]   - The good news about that question,
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.800]   that collar we should say,
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.200]   is that she's thinking about this.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.840]   That's the biggest issue with college kids in these issues
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.600]   and with student stress in college
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.300]   is that most students that are doing the traditional,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.580]   I'm 19 doing a four-year residential college,
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.120]   those type of students is they don't wanna hear it.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.860]   I don't wanna hear study advice.
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.960]   It's gonna make me uncool or something like that.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.740]   I'm fine, I can just do it.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:51.740]   And it's so needlessly stressful and overwhelming.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.740]   College, if you do it right,
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.860]   if you keep your schedule reasonable
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.560]   and don't do the 70 extracurricular nonsense
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.140]   and don't do the triple major nonsense
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.900]   and you autopilot schedule and pre-plan your exams and papers
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.700]   you don't have to work at night.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.280]   And you rarely have a busy day.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.340]   It's not that much work.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.300]   It all changes when you get out there in the real world
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.300]   if you follow and have an ambitious, difficult job.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.220]   So it doesn't have to be that hard.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.780]   But the main thing is thinking
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.820]   I'm actually going to be systematic
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.260]   about how I approach my job as a student.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.420]   Like that's the zero to one binary for college life
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.920]   that makes all the difference.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.140]   It did for me.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.700]   All right, well, let's do a, before we do a final call,
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.620]   I'll talk about a couple other sponsors here real quick.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.120]   This next ad comes to you from a company
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.900]   that's cooking the best omelets you'll have all year
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.460]   all while changing the world one egg at a time.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.420]   It's called Just Egg.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.700]   Now I talked to you about Just Egg on Monday's episode
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.340]   but let me remind you what this is.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:53.020]   Just Egg is a cholesterol-free plant-based egg
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.100]   that will give you the most decadent quiches of your life,
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.020]   the fluffiest scrambled
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.300]   and the easiest egg sandwiches of all time.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.700]   As I mentioned, I eat a lot of chicken eggs.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.540]   It feels like too much chicken eggs.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.180]   Just Egg was the solution I needed
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.060]   because I like the taste of them, of chicken eggs.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.440]   I don't want to have them every day.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:12.900]   So I can throw Just Eggs into my schedule instead
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:17.900]   and get a nice cholesterol-free plant-based product
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.240]   that I can enjoy.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.700]   The one thing I'll say, Jesse,
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.900]   that I'm not sure about Just Egg and it worries me
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.060]   because I haven't tested it yet is
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.860]   what if I want to throw this at someone
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.800]   that I am trying to jeer or indicate my displeasure?
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.300]   'Cause this is one of the key uses of eggs
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.140]   is throwing them at people, right?
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.220]   You egg people when they're saying something you don't like,
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.820]   you suspect they might be a witch or a sorcerer,
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.860]   or if they are trying to push some sort of unpopular cause.
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.780]   And I gotta say,
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.060]   this is something I think we need to test out.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.640]   We need to pelt people with Just Egg.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.020]   It's not actually a, it's liquid form,
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.660]   so I don't know how it's gonna work.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:05.700]   So we're gonna have to figure out
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.580]   how to actually take that product
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.620]   and turn it into something
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.220]   that we can actually pelt at someone.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.880]   But once we have solved that problem
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.020]   and combine it with the fact
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.980]   that this is a cholesterol-free plant-based egg
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.460]   that tastes great and helps the plant
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.300]   'cause it's good for you,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.280]   I think we'll really be onto something.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.620]   I think like a disposable sling or something like that.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.840]   I'm trying to think, because it's liquid,
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.540]   but we could get it into some sort of thing
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.460]   so that you could throw it at someone that you're jeering.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   - All I can think about is you in the field
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.660]   in Lord of the Rings doing that.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.300]   - It would be counterproductive
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.380]   because there's no one else there.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   It would just be me alone.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.420]   And eventually, a Brandon Sarensen-type character
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.180]   would come by and cast a wind spell on an elf,
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.820]   and I would pelt them with Just Egg.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.100]   There we go.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.900]   So that's what's gonna happen.
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.460]   But no, keep your eyes open for Just Egg.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.780]   This has been an important part of my routine.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.300]   I love throwing it in there 'cause I'm an egg guy.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.420]   - Hi, Kevin.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:12.340]   All right, let's also talk briefly about, oh, New Relic.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.820]   Yeah, so I'll tell you, if there's a topic
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.900]   that Jesse won't stop bothering me about
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.260]   in just casual conversation,
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.340]   it has to do with getting transparency
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:25.140]   into debugging for your entire software stack.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.740]   It just bothers me about this.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.700]   He's like, "Cal, I..."
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.860]   No, this is not in Jesse's wheelhouse,
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.020]   but it's in my world as a computer scientist,
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.940]   and I'm around a lot of computer engineers,
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.420]   people who run computer companies,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.660]   and I can tell you, New Relic
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:46.460]   is one of these critical products in that world, right?
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.940]   So if you're running one of these complex software stacks
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.660]   and something breaks,
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.100]   you need to figure out where the issue is.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.420]   And what a lot of people do is they just start calling people
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:59.700]   and using ad hoc tools and going onto their cloud interface
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.300]   and seeing what's going on with their processes.
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.020]   That is a chaotic way to deal with problems.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.380]   The better solution is New Relic,
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.900]   which combines 16 different monitoring products
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.980]   that you'd normally buy separately
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.460]   that allows engineering teams to see
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.140]   across the entire software stack in this one place.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.620]   You can pinpoint issues down to the single line of codes.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.860]   You know exactly why a problem happens.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.700]   You can resolve it quickly.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.260]   It's why dev and ops teams at DoorDash, GitHub, Epic Games,
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:34.140]   and more than 14,000 other companies use this tool.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.760]   If you're in the dev or ops business,
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.700]   you know New Relic.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.420]   If you're in that business and you're not using New Relic,
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.340]   you should be.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.900]   I don't know why you want it.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.900]   So whether you run a cloud native startup
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.060]   or are a Fortune 500 company,
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.700]   it takes just five minutes to set up New Relic
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.460]   in your environment.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.520]   So the next time,
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.720]   the next issue is what I mean to say.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.540]   See, I'm thinking about pelting wizards.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:03.460]   This is my problem.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.380]   Now I have that in my head,
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.980]   pelting wizards with liquid egg.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.260]   The next issue is just waiting to happen.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.320]   So you should get New Relic before it does.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   You can get access to the whole New Relic platform
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.240]   and a hundred gigabytes of data free and forever.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.640]   No credit card required.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.320]   Sign up at newrelic.com/deep.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:27.080]   That's N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.com/deep.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.320]   Newrelic.com/deep.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.560]   All right, Jesse, I think we have time for one more call
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.440]   because I'm running late today,
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.980]   but let's get one more call in.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.880]   Who do we have here?
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:38.720]   - All right, sounds good.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.600]   We got a question, a call about living a deep life.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.440]   - There we go.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.120]   - Hi Cal, this is Karan.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.200]   And I took a break from my 33 jobs
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.900]   to retreat to a cabin in the woods
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.360]   and think about who am I,
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.640]   what is identity and how is it crafted?
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.960]   And I came up with this heuristic
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.080]   that I would love your thoughts on.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.720]   And I have a question that I put a lot of thought
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.640]   and research into.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.720]   First part of this heuristic that I came up with
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.800]   is identity.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.040]   Who am I and how do I live a deep life?
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.480]   And I go very descriptive into that area.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.840]   Next is philosophy.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.240]   Digital minimalism helps back up that identity.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.820]   Then we have framework.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.120]   We use digital minimalism as that framework
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.520]   for living a deep life,
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.700]   but we also have the atomic habits by James Clear.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.160]   And I use that as part of the framework category.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.880]   After that, we have behavioral techniques.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.760]   And this is like where like the nitty gritty,
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.960]   I leave my phone at home and I go for a walk.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.840]   I enjoy solitude.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.400]   And then we have outcomes, which is really important
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.700]   because we gotta know how do these behaviors,
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.880]   what outcomes do they have?
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.840]   I back on how my anxiety goes down.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.520]   Now I'm reading Brad Stolberg's book
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.200]   on this idea of how I wanted to keep improving
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.240]   and this idea of always trying to optimize everything.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.080]   And this is where my question comes in.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.640]   'Cause the last part of my heuristic is feedback.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.120]   I wanna make sure I do better at living the deep life.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.680]   But this compound 1% interest that you and James talk about
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.520]   and that this idea that Brad talks about,
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.600]   it can be like, how do I,
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.340]   if I keep trying to optimize living a deep life,
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:15.320]   how do I get rid of this background of anxiety?
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.960]   - Well, Karan, I appreciate the thought you put into this.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.080]   And let me just preface my response by saying
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.600]   just the fact that you were putting
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.920]   this much intentional thought
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.120]   into how you want to structure your life
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.320]   is 80% of the battle.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.400]   Most people don't do that.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.720]   Most people go from one distraction
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.040]   or moment of chemical pleasure to another
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.040]   and hope to string along enough of those
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.560]   to get later on in life.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.000]   It's not the way to do it.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.920]   You need a plan, you need to be intentional.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.360]   The second thing I'm gonna preface it
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.880]   is these type of plans evolve over time and that's great.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   The goal is not to figure out the one true plan
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.120]   that's absolutely optimal
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.560]   and then you have it all figured out, then you execute it.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.440]   You don't want paralysis by analysis here.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.360]   You come up with something, you live with it,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.680]   check in twice a year,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.360]   check in at your birthday to make changes.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.560]   So you wanna make sure that you're spending
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.520]   a lot of time living life
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.800]   and not just thinking about how you're gonna live life.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.920]   So those are some prefaces.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.760]   All right, now let me start with your last point
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.440]   about beating back the background anxiety
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.500]   so that you can live a deep life.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.120]   These are unrelated.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.080]   Anxiety will do what anxiety does.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.360]   You will feel anxiety sometimes, other times you won't.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.520]   There will be periods where it's heavier,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.760]   there'll be periods where it is not heavier.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.880]   Your goal is not to make that go away.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.240]   Your goal is to live a deep life
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.680]   even though you live in a world
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.840]   in which you sometimes feel
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.520]   the physical symptoms of anxiety.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.240]   Constriction of the chest,
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.600]   a little bit difficulty of breathing.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.040]   There's very specific physical symptoms.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.320]   That comes and goes.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.280]   Great, what's next?
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.320]   How do I still build a deep life?
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.360]   So I don't want you to think about banishing
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.560]   that which you cannot fully control from your life
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.960]   as a precondition for it being good,
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.920]   for it being enjoyable.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.120]   And I'm gonna recommend the book here.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.200]   So there are, I don't know how much you know
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.060]   about modern psychotherapy,
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.020]   but there's, roughly speaking,
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.960]   people think about there being three waves
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.100]   of modern psychotherapy.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.480]   You have the first wave where you have talk therapy,
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.600]   which sort of came originally out of Freudian modalities.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.840]   Let's talk things through
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.740]   and try to understand the source of issues.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.400]   Largely, this was non-evidence-based therapy modalities.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.160]   Then the second wave really is
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.120]   like cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.640]   And this was one of the first major approaches
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.040]   to issues like anxiety
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.560]   in which they were using studies and evidence
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.880]   and saying this type of thing worked.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.280]   In the core book, the canonical public-facing book
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.840]   in second wave psychotherapy is "Feeling Good."
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.360]   And I believe this came out,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.600]   so the '70s or '80s,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   and it introduced cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.040]   to a larger group.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.980]   Third wave psychotherapies is built more around
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.140]   what is sometimes called acceptance commitment therapy
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.420]   or ACT, A-C-T.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.620]   There's some other things in there,
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.580]   but it pulls more from some Eastern philosophies as well.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.300]   This is where I want to turn your attention,
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.480]   and I want to turn your attention to a book
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.380]   that popularizes ACT,
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.700]   and that is the book, I believe it is called
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.460]   "The Happiness Trap."
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.740]   Actually, Jesse, can you look that up
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.080]   and tell me what the author's name is?
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.520]   I want to make sure I got that name right.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.000]   But it's a book that introduces
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.600]   acceptance commitment therapy to a broader audience.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.920]   And this is a evidence-based methodology.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.820]   It's something that's studied pretty well,
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.560]   and I like it a lot.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.320]   I think it's what I want to preach to you right now.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.160]   Because at the core,
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.760]   I can tell you what's at the core of acceptance,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.440]   if you'll excuse this digression into psychotherapy,
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.440]   but at the core of this is this notion that,
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.420]   oh, we have a name here?
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.660]   Yeah, Russ Harris, that's right.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.980]   And it is "The Happiness Trap," Jesse,
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.820]   did I get that right?
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.260]   - Yep. - That's right.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.780]   So at the core of acceptance commitment therapy
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.900]   is they look back at cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.060]   and cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.900]   directly addresses ruminations.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:11.380]   Ruminations, these insistent, hard-to-control conversations
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.460]   you have with yourself in your head
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.740]   are at the core of both major anxiety
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.060]   and depressive disorders.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.420]   Because if you're obsessively worried about,
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.340]   so you have these talks,
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.380]   these conversations in your head
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.020]   about bad things that could happen, it's anxiety.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.700]   And if you have these hard-to-control,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.620]   consistent voices, conversations in your head
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:34.620]   about what you've done that's bad and why you suck,
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.220]   that's the foundation for depression.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.460]   So it's the same thing as the voices.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.900]   And cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.700]   again, if you'll excuse the lecture here,
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.080]   focused on directly confronting ruminations.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.960]   And so you would say, wait a second,
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.900]   this is the thing I keep talking about.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.020]   Let me actually point out the ways
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.860]   in which that thinking is distorted,
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.060]   because often in anxiety and in depression
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.180]   is very distorted thinking.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.660]   There's names for the distortion.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.640]   This is black and white thinking.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.700]   This is predicting the future.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.740]   And you call it out and you push back at it
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.420]   and say, this is the problem with this rumination.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.260]   And over time, that can actually diminish the power
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.620]   of that rumination to keep cycling faster and faster.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:14.860]   And this can be quite effective for a lot of things.
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.460]   In fact, I use this quite successfully.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.560]   If you want a personal story,
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.560]   when I was first having bad insomnia problems
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.300]   early in grad school,
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.020]   and there's a whole backstory to that,
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.380]   but basically there's very little
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.820]   I get anxious about in my life,
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.340]   even as I do pretty ambitious, big things
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.580]   that should be scary.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.220]   And my theory has always been,
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.660]   all these things I'm doing that should be really anxious,
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.820]   anxiety producing, all that anxiety just got funneled
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.060]   into this random weird thing,
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.820]   which was I got very anxious about sleep
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.060]   and I felt physical anxiety every single day.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.980]   I was sleeping, but the anxiety about not sleeping
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:48.820]   was every single day.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.980]   And I read "Feeling Good."
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.780]   I read the book about cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.700]   And this was a case where that worked really well
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.820]   because the ruminations that were creating this anxiety
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.580]   about not sleeping were disordered.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.620]   They were clearly exaggerating.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.620]   And I could call out the distortions.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.860]   And I had a system where I said twice a day,
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.740]   in the morning and in the evening,
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.740]   I'm gonna address these thoughts
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.500]   and point out the distortions, but not in between.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.060]   And in between, my mind's like,
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.780]   let's think about sleep and why we're worried.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.980]   I would say, I thought about this,
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.860]   went through it in the morning and wasn't that impressed
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.220]   and I'll do it again in the evening.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.860]   So just wait till then,
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.820]   and then we'll get back to it in the evening.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.460]   And that actually worked.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.300]   And the day-to-day anxiety,
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.220]   and for this particular anxiety, it took a long time,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.340]   but it went away, it was very effective.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.780]   ACT came along and said,
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.900]   there are certain things for which that doesn't work.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.060]   Right, because what if the thing that you're anxious about,
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.060]   what if the story there is accurate?
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.340]   What if it's not distorted?
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.860]   And the key thing that really,
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.900]   the key thing that led to the divergence of ACT,
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.660]   my understanding of ACT from cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.780]   were panic attacks.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.700]   So even with panic attacks,
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.700]   you get a rising sense of panic leads to a place
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.180]   where you kind of tip over an edge
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.420]   and have your heart goes, it feels like a heart attack,
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.220]   you can become faint.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.460]   And it could be like a really just disturbing public thing.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.740]   And what the ACT people pointed out was,
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.740]   that's not a, if you're anxious about that happening,
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.580]   you're gonna go on stage,
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.420]   you're anxious about that happening,
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.700]   it's not a distorted thought.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.900]   Like it really could happen.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.820]   And maybe this has been happening to you quite a bit.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:28.420]   So you can't look at yourself and convince yourself,
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.780]   oh, it's just distorted,
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.060]   of course you're not gonna have a panic attack.
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.300]   It's like, I just had three, I very well could.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.620]   So cognitive behavioral therapy didn't work as well
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.820]   for panic attacks.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.740]   And so acceptance commitment therapy was about,
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.380]   okay, you're not trying to challenge the thought,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.980]   you make space for the thought,
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.180]   but instead of getting into it,
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.340]   like let's really get into it,
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:50.340]   you say, despite that,
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.340]   I'm gonna go commit to doing something that's value driven.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.820]   Because what matters is living true to your values.
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.980]   And like, that's ultimately what matters,
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.020]   I'm gonna commit to do that,
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.140]   even though something bad could happen.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.700]   And ACT is all about,
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:04.500]   and you'll read this in "The Happiness Trap",
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.220]   you're able to separate from the feeling of anxiety.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.180]   It's there, it's the Eastern part of it.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.260]   But it's just a sensation.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.380]   It's just physical.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.300]   Great, I'm feeling that.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.220]   It's like my knee hurts.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.580]   Great, what's next?
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.500]   And you learn to separate from the part of your mind
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.380]   that wants to tell the stories.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.420]   We gotta think about this,
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.740]   but what if there's a panic attack?
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.620]   And what if this happens?
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.220]   And what if you, this or that happens, right?
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.380]   And you say, I see that story there,
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.980]   and I'm not mad at that part of my mind,
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.740]   and it's like a character and I give it a name,
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.020]   and maybe this is the patron of panic attacks.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.820]   And I'm not mad at that person, that character in my mind,
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.860]   but I'm not gonna get into it with them.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.260]   What I'm gonna do is this thing right here,
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.140]   because it's important to me,
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.300]   and I wanna live true to my values,
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.660]   regardless of what happens.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.220]   And so you go do it anyways.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.300]   And so when they would deal with people
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.540]   with severe anxiety, they'd say,
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.820]   you go to the party anyways,
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.740]   and you give the talk anyways, and you do whatever.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.980]   And I like that.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.860]   And I would say this is a very long way around
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.820]   to saying the deep life is about living
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.820]   in a value-driven way, despite everything else that happens.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.020]   Not about creating a life
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.820]   that these specific good things happen,
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.060]   and there is no bad.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.540]   That's called the fantasy life.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.140]   That's not a life that you're gonna achieve.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.260]   No one achieves that life.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.940]   We all have our issues.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.900]   I had to deal with the anxiety with the sleep thing.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.460]   I don't have, I have not classic panic attacks,
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:27.060]   but I've gone through, I have weird stuff happens to me.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.060]   I have whatever, automatic, autonomic,
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.500]   nervous system panic attack style reactions.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.860]   I've had this all the time.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:36.980]   Faint.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:42.820]   I'll have a severe, I'll get lightheaded,
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.500]   and my whole body will break out in sweat.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.100]   Look, man, I've been through all this stuff.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.900]   And you wanna talk about high stakes, how about,
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.500]   okay, you're about to go on air on this network,
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.980]   or you're on stage in front of a huge number of people,
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.460]   or you're here sitting next to the dean.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.860]   And so I've gone, so we all have this stuff we go through.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.340]   And because the point is, our goal is not to avoid
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.220]   bad things from happening, avoid bad sensations,
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.820]   and have only good things happen to us.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.460]   The goal is to live deeply, to live true to your values,
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.180]   despite it, it's the ACT mindset.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.740]   It's the mindset that Russ Harris talks about
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.380]   in "The Happiness Trap."
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.420]   So that's the piece I really, Karan,
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.740]   wanted the focus on here, is focus on what you can control
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.100]   in building this good life.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.820]   The stuff you can't control will come and go.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.380]   It'll do what it does.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.100]   Whatever, and you can't, a lot of that you can't control.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.700]   Be happy when it's, hey, I'm not feeling this thing
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.940]   I don't like, great, I'm happy.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.900]   But when it's there, don't be devastated.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.180]   Be like, crap, but I'm still doing this thing
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.900]   I really find important.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.740]   So I think that's good.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:45.700]   Now, onto your framework.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.540]   I mean, look, I nerd out on this stuff all the time.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.220]   So yes, I like what you're doing here.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.580]   You're building out a system of different layers.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.520]   You're thinking things through.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.360]   I think of what you're doing
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.980]   as called a personal operating system
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.540]   that has these different stack layers that meet together.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.340]   My only word of warning would be,
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.300]   make sure that the fiddling of the knobs
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.740]   doesn't take over the actual living.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.660]   In the end, you actually, life is hard and complicated,
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.020]   and some days you're anxious, and some days you get sick,
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.620]   and you're out of commission for two weeks,
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.660]   and you can't follow your system.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.220]   And you wanna make sure that in the end,
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.340]   you're present and have gratitude,
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.500]   and are doing interesting things and enjoying good moments,
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.580]   and that you're not spending all your time
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.500]   thinking about your system.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.180]   But I'm glad you're thinking about it.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.340]   I like your heuristics.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.180]   Try 'em.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.780]   If they don't work, change 'em.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.820]   Feel free to simplify them if you feel stressed
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.420]   by just the complexity of your system.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.620]   I think that's all fine.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.500]   But let's go back to this original point,
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:41.140]   is the goal of the deep life here is not to avoid the bad.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.420]   It is to live good,
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.120]   even when the inevitable bad comes and goes.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.900]   All right, Cron, well, talking about going,
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.940]   I am running late,
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.020]   so we should probably wrap up this episode.
