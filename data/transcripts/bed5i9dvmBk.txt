[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.080]   A heartbroken dad writes in
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.180]   who has a rebellious 15-year-old daughter.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.480]   She will not attend church with the family.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.480]   We addressed that topic in episode 1421 live in Nashville.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.680]   You might remember we covered that, episode 1421.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   This same heartbroken dad has a second question
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.800]   we have not addressed in the podcast, and it's this.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.400]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.400]   and for your books.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.080]   I thank God for your ministry
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.120]   as it has touched my life and so many others.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.840]   My wife and I recently became aware
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280]   that our 15-year-old daughter is sexually active.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.640]   She was raised in a Christian home,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.360]   and we have done our best as Christian parents
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   to instill in our children
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.360]   godly traits and characteristics.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.960]   How would you approach this
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.000]   if she was your teenage daughter?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.980]   There are very few things
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.040]   that can compare to the sorrow
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.320]   of the gut punch that takes your breath away
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.280]   when you find out that your own son or daughter
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960]   is involved in beliefs or practices
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   which not only go against what you've taught them,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.440]   but could ruin both their earthly
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.120]   and their eternal lives.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360]   You feel helpless as a parent,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.360]   angry, fearful, uncertain about what to do,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.000]   and deep, deep sadness
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.320]   at what this could mean for your child.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.860]   So I don't blame these parents for reaching out for help
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.480]   because I would do the same thing.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.280]   I have done the same thing.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.740]   I'm going to make a few assumptions now
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.380]   because I can't give any counsel
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.760]   without assuming some things.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.580]   And if the assumptions are wrong,
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580]   then you'll need to make the adjustments.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.840]   But I hope what I have to say will point in helpful ways,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680]   even if some of my assumptions may not be accurate.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   I'm going to assume that your daughter has, at some point,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.240]   made some kind of profession of faith in Jesus,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.440]   whether she's a real believer or not.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.280]   I'm going to assume that she's not so rebellious
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.320]   that she refuses to talk
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.840]   or is threatening to run away permanently.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.920]   And I'm going to assume that my suggestion
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.600]   is not the only step I would take,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.360]   but that you would make other steps
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.040]   and I would make other steps as well.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.680]   For example, if you know who the boy is
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.760]   and even know who his parents are,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.560]   this could create a situation
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.000]   that allows for more united involvement
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.320]   with the parents and the young people,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.960]   depending on so many factors.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.720]   But that would come after what I'm suggesting here.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.080]   So here's what I think I would do.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.040]   I'll just list it off to you.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.520]   And what's helpful, use.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   What's not, ignore.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.200]   First, I would weep alone, I'm sure,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.320]   and then with my wife.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.240]   She needs you, a husband, and you need each other.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   Second, I would cry out to God for wisdom and grace
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.560]   in myself, in my wife,
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.240]   and I would cry out for the miracle of repentance
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.080]   in my daughter.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.880]   That's a gift of God, according to 2 Timothy 2.25.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   Third, I would take hold of several biblical promises
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.360]   and use them to establish my wobbly heart
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.640]   and give hope to my wife.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.560]   For example, Jeremiah 32.17.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.920]   Oh, Lord God, it is you who have made the heavens
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.200]   and the earth by your great power,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.380]   and nothing is too hard for you.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.200]   Or Isaiah 41.10.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.600]   Fear not, for I am with you.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.220]   I will strengthen you.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.320]   I will help you.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.240]   I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.760]   Or Psalm 103.13.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.400]   Just as a father has compassion on his children,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.320]   so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.560]   The fourth thing I would do is to make sure
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.680]   that I have the facts rather than hearsay.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.480]   Those facts would best come from your daughter.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.000]   What have you done?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.700]   Tell me, who is the boy?
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.160]   How do you see the relationship?
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.020]   Who are his parents?
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.760]   How do you feel about what you did?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.360]   What are you doing now, et cetera?
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.200]   You need facts.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.800]   Fifth, I as her father would plan
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   an overnight weekend getaway to another town
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.920]   with my daughter alone,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.360]   and would rent an Airbnb or hotel with two bedrooms,
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.420]   and tell her that you plan to take her away
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.960]   for a couple of days, just the two of you.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   There would be no trickery here.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.580]   You're not trying to sneak up on her at all.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.280]   All is out in the open.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.880]   This is about a father and a daughter dealing together
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.540]   with one of the most important issues they have ever faced.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.500]   She should know that upfront.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.960]   Sixth, without sharing details,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   I would ask two or three closest spiritually mature friends
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.020]   of mine or you of yours to pray for me in these days
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.860]   while I take her away and deal with the most difficult thing
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.260]   I've ever faced, perhaps.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.320]   I wouldn't share the details about it with them,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.140]   and they'd be the kind of person who wouldn't probe,
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.360]   but I want their prayer.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.660]   Seventh, I would take whatever time is needed
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.780]   before that weekend to compose a letter to my daughter
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.760]   about what I want her to hear from my heart to hers.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.340]   I would write this down,
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.460]   and I would plan to read it to her in person, face-to-face,
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.860]   in some private setting during our getaway.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.420]   I would write it from my heart with all the truth
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.420]   and compassion and multi-layered concern that I feel.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.460]   I would probably let my wife read it before I go.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.100]   There would be another strategy for her involvement,
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.440]   which I won't talk about here.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.120]   Eighth, the letter would go something like this,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.300]   and I can't write the whole thing here.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.900]   I'll get it started so that you can get the idea
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.840]   of the way I would go about it,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.940]   because it would be much longer than I can read here,
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.980]   'cause there's so many things that need to be touched on.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.220]   Let's call her Janet.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.180]   I don't know her name.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.440]   I'm just making this up, Janet.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.140]   Dear Janet, I'm sitting across the table from her
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.820]   or on a couch.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.540]   Someday, Janet, you may be a mother
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.700]   and have teenagers of your own,
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.660]   and I am sure that you will love them
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.060]   with every ounce of your being,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.100]   but you will never be a dad,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.420]   and so you're gonna have to take my word for this,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.420]   that the love of a father for his daughter is very deep.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.420]   It's a powerful thing.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.540]   You are bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh,
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.280]   not in a romantic way, like with your mother,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.260]   but because you carry my very being
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.220]   in your body and your mind.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.040]   I am one flesh with your mother by God's decree,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.900]   but I am one flesh with you by God's design
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.500]   in the very way you came into being.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.780]   Now, let me insert a parenthesis here,
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.340]   'cause I have an adoptive daughter,
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.220]   and I've never had to write a letter like this, thank God.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.660]   If I were writing to an adoptive daughter,
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.420]   I wouldn't say what I just said.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.940]   I would say adoptive things that would be just as amazing
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.860]   and just as powerful because of my having chosen her
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.060]   like God chose me and lots of other glorious things
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.860]   about adoption that you can say,
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.260]   but I'm talking to a daughter here
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.020]   whose very DNA courses through our blood vessels.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.880]   Okay, back to my letter.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   I have been placed by God as the one who is most accountable
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.300]   to provide for you in your youth and protect you
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.460]   and build into you patterns of life
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.900]   that will lead you to a joyful and fruitful,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.700]   and we pray, eternal life.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.820]   I have been your father now for 15 years,
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.260]   and I have rejoiced to watch God give you life
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.580]   and health and beauty and intelligence and grace.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.580]   With every passing year
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.700]   and with every passing season of maturity,
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.680]   I have come to love you more and more.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.540]   My concern in the matter of your sexual life
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.260]   is not mainly, Janet, for my reputation
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.780]   or the honor of our family or our name.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.860]   Those things matter, but my concern, Janet, is you.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.580]   I ask you to believe me and to hear what I have to say
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   as the man who loves you more than any other man
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.060]   on this earth.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.060]   I want your greatest earthly happiness and fruitfulness,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.940]   and I want your greatest eternal joy
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.500]   in the presence of God because of Jesus.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.120]   The most important person in this situation right now,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.220]   Janet, is not me.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.200]   It's not your mother, it's not your boyfriend,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.880]   and it's not you.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.420]   The main person right now is Jesus Christ.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.580]   He is alive.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.080]   He upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.200]   He is here by his spirit.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.040]   He suffered and died,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.980]   not just to remove the guilt of our sin,
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.160]   but to keep us from sinning.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.700]   And he has spoken with great love and seriousness
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.900]   about our sexuality.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.360]   This is not about being old-fashioned or new-fashioned
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.200]   or churchy or non-churchy.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.540]   It's about the most important thing in the world,
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.180]   our relationship to Jesus Christ
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.260]   and whether we embrace him as our treasure
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.360]   and submit to his wisdom.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.160]   What he said is this, flee from sexual immorality.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.460]   Do you not know?
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.660]   Hear this, Janet, spoken directly to you
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.500]   from the Lord who died for you.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.140]   Do you not know that your body
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.700]   is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.160]   whom you have from God?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.780]   You're not your own.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.360]   You were bought with a price.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.620]   So glorify God in your body.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.620]   You and I know, Janet,
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.620]   what that price was that he paid
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.640]   to keep you pure
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.820]   and to make you a beautiful reflection
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.420]   of his glory, his beauty.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.600]   That price was the horrific suffering and death
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.620]   of the one who loved you and gave himself for you.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.980]   When Jesus died, Janet, he bought us,
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.220]   meaning he paid a ransom to free us from the devil
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.620]   and from sin and from destruction.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.620]   It cost him his life.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.980]   That's how much he loves you.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.360]   That's how much I love you.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.720]   I would die for you, Janet.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.000]   And Jesus did die for you.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.600]   Therefore, he owns you.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.860]   You belong to him.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.820]   You don't belong primarily to me or your mother
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.980]   or your boyfriend or yourself.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.320]   You belong, body and soul, to Jesus.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.620]   And the reason he bought you from sin
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.580]   was to make known the glory of God's grace
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.900]   in satisfying your soul forever.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.740]   Now, I can't finish this letter.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.940]   It would go on for several more pages,
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.780]   but let me give you the bullet points
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.700]   of what it would include.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.140]   Number one, Janet, it's not too late.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.420]   There's forgiveness and cleansing.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.940]   Number two, God is able to give you self-control.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.860]   Number three, if your boyfriend really loves you
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.420]   and has character that you can trust,
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.780]   he'll protect you and keep you.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.380]   Never have sex with you again outside marriage.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.640]   That's how you can know what kind of man he is.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.260]   Number four, sex is beautiful in marriage.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.640]   Knitting two souls together very deeply
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.620]   in permanent covenant.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.760]   It's not a vulgar thing.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.980]   It's beautiful in marriage.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.040]   Five, but outside marriage, you're playing with fire, Janet,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.660]   both for spiritual reasons, which are most important,
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.740]   but also physical disease reasons
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.060]   and pregnancy reasons and many more.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.260]   Six, you're very young.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.060]   Desires are very strong,
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.340]   but those desires are not always the best guide
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.360]   for your life.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.000]   God has given you parents to help you have a longer view,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.460]   a wiser view than you can have at 15.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.500]   Seven, will you trust us?
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.340]   And then you'd pray with her,
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.020]   and how she responds to that letter
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.560]   will shape what you do next.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.700]   But that would be how I would start.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.540]   - Heavy.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.360]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.620]   for walking us through all these options
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.260]   to illustrate the urgency of this situation.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.740]   You can just feel the urgency.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.820]   I appreciate it.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.740]   We are going to break for the weekend now,
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.860]   and when we return,
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.980]   we're gonna hear from a listener
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.140]   to the podcast named Matthew.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.020]   Matthew was saved in college
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.700]   through a faithful preaching ministry
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.140]   on his college campus.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.020]   He's now graduated and is looking for a new home church
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.620]   and is being asked about whether or not he's been baptized.
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.940]   He hasn't been baptized.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.020]   He plans to do it.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.340]   But first, Matthew wants to know
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.500]   why are we baptized in the first place?
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.260]   Why is baptism important?
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.860]   On the podcast, we haven't addressed this yet.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.340]   We will on Monday.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.180]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.460]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.340]   with longtime pastor and author and dad, John Piper.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.540]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:37.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
