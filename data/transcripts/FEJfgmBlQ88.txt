[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Should I be worried if I'm buying gift cards that five other people might have seen the
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240]   code?
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.160]   And is there a lot of fraud in this industry?
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.940]   The amount of fraud that we experience among our members is very low, because our members
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.200]   tend to be somewhat professional.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.120]   They're doing this as some kind of business.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.300]   And we we have know your customer requirements, there's a delay to get paid.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.320]   So that creates some security that if people upload completely bunk card information, they
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.840]   won't get paid, the user gets a refund, I think that the risk is similar to if you were
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640]   to buy one in a store, because there's also fraud that can take place with physical cards,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.600]   where people will swap out a card, they'll write down the card information, the card
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400]   you activate at the register won't be the one that you're actually buying, because they've
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.960]   done a swap, there is a risk of fraud, I don't think the risk is substantial, though.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.560]   And I think that if you buy from a reputable place, they'll make you whole.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.640]   And so it's just not not a major worry.
