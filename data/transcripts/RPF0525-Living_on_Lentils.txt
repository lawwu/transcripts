[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Once upon a time, the philosopher Diogenes
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   was eating bread and lentils for supper.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   who lived comfortably by flattering the king.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Said Aristippus, "If you would learn to be subservient to the king,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   you would not have to live on lentils."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Said Diogenes, "Learn to live on lentils
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and you will not have to be subservient to the king."
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Friend, if you will learn to live on lentils
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and practice the skill over time,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   you can enjoy a lifetime of liberty.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Now personally, I happen to believe that liberty
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   is something worth enjoying and worth pursuing.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   There are many paths to liberty,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   but wherever you are, if you have the skill
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   of living on lentils, read that of course as a metaphor
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   for being able to live frugally,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   you will be able to avoid a lifetime of subservience.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   That's a powerful concept because it is within your skill
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and within your ability.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   These are skills and abilities that you can learn.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   This is not something where you have to go and earn $10 million
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   in order to be financially free.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   That may be possible for you, and if so, you should pursue it.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That may not be possible for you.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   But it is possible for every person to learn to live on lentils,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   so you'll not have to be subservient to the king.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   If you will practice this skill and over your lifetime
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   continually keep yourself free of entangling alliances,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   you'll be able to be far more impactful in the world.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   If you are a teacher and you possess the skill of living on lentils,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   you'll be able to teach as you believe you should.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You'll be able to teach what you believe you should
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   without fear and concern over your administration
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and what they believe that you should or should not do.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   If you are a businessman and you are able to live on lentils,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   you can serve your customers the way that you believe that you should
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   without too much regard to the popularity in the marketplace.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   If you are a preacher and you will learn to live on lentils,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   you can present the pure, unadulterated, unfiltered, unmixed word of God
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   to your congregation without fear of their response.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   If you are a politician, you can speak what you believe to be true
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and act out of principle and stand courageously
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   in a time of moral vacuity.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You'll be unconcerned with the loss of your pension
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and the loss of your salary,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   and you'll be concerned with what you were sent into office to do
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   in the first place.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   If you're a mother or a father, if you learn to live on lentils,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   you'll be able to devote yourself to living in a straightforward, clear manner
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   as an example to your children, instructing them
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   in the way they should go without equivocating.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I repeat, the philosopher Diogenes was eating bread and lentils for supper.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   who lived comfortably by flattering the king.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Said Aristippus, "If you would learn to be subservient to the king,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   you would not have to live on lentils."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Said Diogenes, "Learn to live on lentils,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and you will not have to be subservient to the king."
