[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   for the vast majority of human existence we've been nomadic and we've done these kind of wider
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   or tighter nomadic circles depending on the geographic region but they'd move so once humans
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.560]   figured out how to stay in a place that's the initial trigger to what would become civilization
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.240]   i think you said beauty and blood went hand in hand for the aztec what i meant by that is they
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.560]   were absolutely comfortable with human sacrifice and you know ripping people's hearts out this they
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:42.400]   had this this just you know grotesque violent bent but in the same way they also absolutely loved flower
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:53.520]   gardens and poetry and music and dance the same aztec king who would order the hearts of a thousand
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.800]   people extracted also would stand up at dinner parties to recite his own poetry but they were
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.200]   really just surgical about it they'd use a thick obsidian knife where they could just break the ribs
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.880]   right along the sternum and then push the sternum down pull up and just while the person was alive
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:22.000]   yep while the person was alive the following is a conversation with ed barnhart an archaeologist
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   specializing in ancient civilizations of south america mesoamerica and north america this is a
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.160]   lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:44.480]   here's ed barnhart do you think there are lost civilizations in the history of humans on earth
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:53.120]   which we don't know anything about yes i do and in fact you know we we have found some civilizations
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.480]   that we had no idea about just in my lifetime i mean we've got gobekli tepi and we've got the stuff
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.080]   that's going on in the amazon and there's some other less startling things that we had no id existed and
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.840]   push our dates back and give us whole new civilizations we had no idea about so
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.920]   yeah it's happened and i think it'll happen again do you think there's a lost civilization
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:29.680]   in the amazon that uh the amazon jungle has eaten up or is hiding the evidence of yes i do and i uh
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.640]   we're beginning to find it there are these huge what we call geoglyphs these mound groups that are
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.520]   in geometric patterns i think that the average joe when they hear the word civilization they think of
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.880]   something that looks like rome and i don't think we're ever going to find anything that looks like
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.200]   rome in the amazon i think a lot of things there i mean wherever you are on the planet you use your
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.280]   natural resources and in the amazon there's not a whole lot of stone what stone is there is deep deep
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   deep so a lot of their things were built out of dirt and trees and feathers and textiles but is it possible
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.320]   that all that land that's not covered by trees is actually hiding stone for example some architecture
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.960]   some things that's just very difficult to find for archaeologists i think at the base of the andes
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   where the amazon connects to the andes there's a lot of potential there because that's where the stone
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   actually starts poking up when you get down into the basin stone is meters and meters under the ground
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.440]   except for a a stray cliff here and there where the river dug deep and even then only in the dry season
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.680]   because that river rises like over a hundred feet every year well that's one of the things having
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.600]   visited that area uh just interacting with waterfalls and seeing the water i was uh humbled by the power of
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.760]   water to shape landscapes and probably a race history in the context that we're talking about of
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.240]   civilizations as water can just make everything disappear over a period of centuries and millennia
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.200]   and so if there's something existed a very long time ago thousands of years ago it is very possible it
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.640]   was just eaten up by nature absolutely in fact in my opinion that's almost a certainty in a lot of places
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.880]   uh you know the grand canyon was dug by water there's this wimpy little river in it right now
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.320]   and you can't possibly imagine that it dug that but it did the power of nature and
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.200]   geology is really kind of magical and when it comes to you know ancient civilizations that could be from
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.960]   a long time ago there's probably a lot that are just under the ocean and just the wave action have destroyed them and what they haven't destroyed buried deep
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.280]   under the ocean so you think atlantis ever existed
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:11.200]   i don't think that atlantis existed i do think it was one of plato's many parables talking about you know
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.960]   putting it in an interesting story as a teaching device in his school if one did exist or a shadow of it
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:27.760]   my money would be on akrotiri akrotiri is what's left of a big city that was on the island of santorini
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:37.840]   and when their volcano blew up it blew up most of the city and shot chunks of it so fast that 70 miles away
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.680]   in crete there are chunks of santorini in their cliff so it blasted what was ever there but what's
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.160]   left on the side of the crater akrotiri is strangely advanced for its age
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   and so if there's anything that's a model for atlantis as plato explained it
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.280]   it's akrotiri akrotiri the ancient greek city so it says the settlement was destroyed in the
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.720]   theron eruption sometime in the 16th century bce and buried in volcanic ash which preserved the remains
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.360]   of the frescoes and many objects and artworks so we don't know how advanced that civilization was
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.680]   no but we can walk around the ruins and see that it's got streets it's got plumbing it's got little
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:35.040]   sconces for uh for torches at night it was a vibrant city with uh with a lot of especially in terms of
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.440]   hydraulic engineering it's it's very advanced for being 3500 years old so if you check out here's an
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:51.920]   image of the uh excavation what a project it's an amazing place and you can tell that it's just part
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.760]   of it because it it's pretty close to where the crater begins so the city itself was probably much
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.720]   larger so in this case there's a lot of evidence but like we said there could be there could be
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.160]   civilizations that there is no there's very little evidence of because of the natural environment that
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.200]   destroys all the evidence right and i think akrotiri is actually a great example of that because here
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.280]   we have the side that did preserve that looks amazing but we know there was more of the city
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.160]   that was completely obliterated it was shot chunks of that city are probably in the walls of crete 70
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.960]   miles away and uh you know plato says that it it sunk it was on an island and it sunk well that's
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.920]   exactly what happened to akrotiri i think this is what plato was referring to if it does exist at least
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.800]   the model of it i think this is probably what he was talking about and there could be other
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.920]   civilizations of which plato has never written right that we have no record of and uh it's humbling to
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.480]   think that entire civilizations with all the dreams the hope the technological innovation the the wars the
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.320]   conflicts the the political tensions all of that uh the social interactions the hierarchies all of that
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:12.480]   the art can be just destroyed like that and forgotten completely lost to ancient history
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.200]   i reflect upon that often as an archaeologist i think about the this great country that i live in and
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.600]   love and all the things we've achieved but you know we're we're a baby historically speaking we've been
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   around 200 years heck a lot of the cities i study in uh central and south america they had a run of you
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:40.320]   know 800 a thousand years and now they're ruins but we're we're barely getting started in terms of
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:49.760]   historical civilizations so humans homo sapiens evolved uh but they didn't start civilizations right away
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.120]   there's a long period of time there's a long period of time when they did not form these complex societies
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:03.280]   so how did we let's say 300 000 years ago in africa actually go from there to creating civilizations
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.480]   i think that a lot of human uh evolution had to do with uh the the pressures that their environment put upon them
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:22.640]   and you know a lot of things start changing right around 12 000 years ago and that's when you know our last
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.800]   ice age really ended i think there was a whole lot of things that just pressured them
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   into especially finding new ways of subsistence here in the americas a huge thing that happened
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:44.240]   was all the megafauna went away when the climate changed enough the the mammoths died out and the bison
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:51.520]   died out and there was just uh they had to come up with different ways of doing things we were hunters
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.080]   and gatherers and we had things we got from hunting and we got things we got from gathering and in the americas
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.000]   when the things that they were used to hunting went away and they had to make do with rabbits
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.760]   there you know the the gathering started to be a much more important thing and i think that led to
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.920]   figuring out hey we could actually grow certain things and gardens turned into crops turned into
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.320]   intensive crops and then people were allowed to gather in bigger groups and survive in a single area
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.960]   they didn't have to roam around anymore and that's where we get the first sedentary communities which
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:37.760]   means they they stayed in the same place all year long for the vast majority of human existence
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.800]   we've been nomadic and we've done these kind of wider or tighter nomadic circles depending on the
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:51.280]   geographic region where they'd know okay you know in the mountains we'll in the we'll be in the summer in the mountains
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.120]   because there's berries and things and then in the winter we'll be down here and we'll hunt
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:03.600]   but they'd move so once humans figured out how to stay in a place i think there that's the initial
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.680]   trigger to what would become civilization what do you think is uh there's a lot of questions i want to ask
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.120]   here what do you think is the motivation for societies is it the the carrot or the stick so you said like
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.720]   is it like when resources run out when the old way of life is no longer feeding everybody then you have
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.200]   to figure stuff out or is it more the carrot of like there's always this kind of human spirit that
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.680]   wants to explore that wants to uh maybe impress the rest of the village or something like this
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.520]   with uh the new discovery they made in venturing out and coming out with different ideas sort of
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:46.720]   technological innovation let's call it well you know i i have an explorer's heart so i'm kind of uh you
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:54.320]   know by i'm biased right you know i i do think that that we have an innate desire to see what's on the
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:01.040]   horizon yeah and to impress other people with our achievements things like that i we're we're social
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:08.400]   beings um that's that that's really the edge that humans have is our ability to work together so i i
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.240]   think that it's much more the carrot than the stick when things get ugly the stick comes out but usually
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.560]   the carrot does the job the really interesting story is how the first people came to the americas
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:29.760]   i mean to me that's pretty gangster to go from asia all the way potentially during the ice
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.320]   age or maybe at the end of the ice age or during that whole period not knowing what the world looks
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.360]   like going into the unknown can you talk to that process how did the first people come to the americas
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:45.280]   well first off i agree with you that was pretty gangster i mean that's that's that's a hard place
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:51.040]   to live i i listened to some of your podcasts is that guy uh jordan jonas yeah the mustard but i i
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.920]   wouldn't have made a crossing there yeah well there you go like the fact that those guys exist
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.680]   that somebody like jordan jonas exists people that uh survive and thrive in these harsh conditions that
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.600]   that's an indication that it's possible but yeah so when when do you think and how did the first people
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:18.480]   come the traditional theories are still somewhat valid or at least you know on the table that when that
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:25.280]   land bridge occurred that nomadic hunters just followed the game like they always had and the
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.880]   game went across there because there was no barrier and they followed them across the thing that has
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:39.520]   changed is how early that happened dna has been a total game changer for archaeology you know we we get
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.720]   all these uh evolutionary tracks that we could never see before when i was a young archaeologist i had i
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   would have never dreamed we'd have the information we have now and that information a lot of it's coming
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:02.880]   out of texas a and m we see the traditional like 12 500 years ago that there was a migration but now
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:10.640]   we're seeing one that's almost certainly happening closer to 30 000 years ago and now the thing that
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:17.440]   seems like madness but might be true is that it could have been as early as 60. a lot of the dna things are
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:25.520]   suggesting that the very first migration could have come across as early as 60. and when i was a younger
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:34.880]   archaeologist it was heresy to go beyond this 12 500 you're a wacko if you said that but now it's really
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.120]   very clear that they came over at least by 30 000 and the bridge opened and closed and opened and closed
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.960]   that's during the ice age right
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.120]   i mean that's crazy right that's that is crazy yeah i mean you know they didn't roll in and
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.240]   immediately make new york but there were people and there were definitely not people here before
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:05.680]   that which is fascinating the uh the when the when the bridge closed dna mutated and so we have specific
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:14.160]   kinds of haplogroups that are here in the americas that don't exist otherwise and that same haplogroup game has
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:22.480]   been showing us more and more that people came across siberia it's not africa it's not western europe
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.760]   those are still you know they've become kind of fringe theories but they're not totally eradicated
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:37.440]   i have dna is uh developing science as well and i think we all need to keep that in mind that it's not
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:44.080]   like they just cracked the code and now we know all the answers and sometimes like in any science
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:50.880]   a breakthrough puts a stew two steps backwards not forwards so i think you know we don't need to have
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:58.160]   too much faith in the models that are now being created through dna but they are pointing in the direction
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:05.680]   of everybody came across from siberia that all native american people are of asiatic descent
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:14.800]   do you think it was a gradual process if it's like 30 to 60 000 years ago was it just gradual movement
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:25.600]   of these nomadic tribes as they follow the animals or was it like one explorer that pushed the the tribe to
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:35.840]   just go go go go and go across maybe across a hundred years travel all the way uh across maybe into north
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.080]   america into north north america where canada is now and then sort of like big leaps in movement versus
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   gradual movement i think it was big leaps and now this is just you know uh mostly guess i'll i'll admit
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:58.560]   but i think that it much in the way that a lot of our evolutionary models talk about punctuated equilibrium
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:06.480]   that there are big moments of change and then it settles out into a more uh slow and steady pattern and
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:14.000]   then something big will happen again i do think that uh the early people went as far as they could go
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.800]   and there were certain colonies that just got isolated for thousands of years one of the fascinating
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.000]   things that dna is showing us which actually blood types were showing us way before that is that the
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.600]   oldest people in the americas are in south america the ones that are uh that got separated early and didn't
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:47.520]   mix their dna like the people in the amazon most of those guys have uh o blood type and their haplogroup d
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:54.960]   which is the oldest one that entered the the us and what are they doing down there if i do believe they
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.600]   came across the bering strait i don't think it's very we have no real evidence to say they they came in mass
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   across uh oceania so they made it probably by boat along the coast all the way to south america so there's
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:18.080]   some kind of some kind of cultural engine that drove them to explore so if you had to bet all your money
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:26.400]   it happened like tens of thousands of years ago but at a very rapid pace there's these explorers that went
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:34.320]   all the way to south america and there established their kind of more stable existence and from there
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.680]   south america mesoamerica north america was kind of gradually expanded into that area like the next
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   waves came down and did north america and central america and the very first wave made it all the
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.480]   way down to south america and got isolated isolated and then mixed in with the next groups that came
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.720]   that's fascinating kind of like there's a there's an interesting correlate in uh
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.800]   in europe where today everybody feels like uh celtic people are from ireland but actually celtic people
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   started in eastern europe and it was the entire area and when rome kind of swept everything and and rome
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:27.120]   was now the the ruler of the day it was only that far edge of the celtic world ireland that they were
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.480]   like ah we're we're not gonna mess with those guys on that island we'll leave them be so now it looks like
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:41.840]   that's the heart of celtic tradition but actually it's the fringe so if it is 60 000 years ago these are
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.920]   really early humans yeah and there were consistent things that have been coming out for decades about
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:57.360]   uh very old carbon 14 dates in the amazon and in the andes area that everybody just dismissed this no
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.920]   he didn't get a date of 40 000 years but i think we're going to come back around to start readdressing
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:10.400]   some of these based on new evidence at hand and that's the interesting thing is you know the early
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.640]   humans spread throughout the world and then like you said perhaps they've gotten isolated and then
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.000]   civilizations sprung from there and they all have similar elements even though they were isolated
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.840]   that's really interesting that's really interesting that there's multiple cradles of civilization
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:36.720]   not just one like one good idea that those ideas naturally come up those structures naturally come up
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.800]   and i i wonder whether you know the similarities that all those cradles have it could be uh you know a
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:55.600]   shared much deeper past that they all have or it could be a more kind of star trek thing where uh you
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.720]   know captain kirk was always talking about the uh the theory of parallel human development that humans across
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:08.000]   the universe go through certain stages of development and that that could be the answer to it
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.920]   which which one do you lean on which which one do you lean towards i think it's a case-by-case
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.800]   thing i think if we look globally i lean much more towards the human parallel development but if i look
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.880]   just to the americas and we have a shorter time period where you know the the things that become major
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:34.800]   civilizations now now now i'll say you know up to 30 000 years ago which is still a blip in the time of
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:44.320]   of humans um i think that there were shared things that those people came over with from asia and that
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:53.440]   as they got separated that they had core values that then turned into things like religion and uh cultural
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.960]   customs that we can see i i'm a big proponent that there are uh commonalities in all the cultures of
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   the americas that lead back to and point to a a single distant origin you've spoken about the lost cradle
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:16.560]   civilization south america so uh south america is not often talked about as one of the cradles
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:23.360]   of civilization south america mesoamerica can you explain well we have very early stuff in south
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:31.120]   america you're right i mean you know especially as uh uh as an american our country's so big and you know
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:37.520]   the we are so far removed from these places we don't even think about it but more and more we're seeing
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:44.800]   things that that predate the earliest stuff that we like to talk about like egypt and mesopotamia
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:53.840]   um there are things it's all on the peruvian coast that we have these cradles of civilization someday
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:00.000]   we might start talking about the amazon more and more but right now what we've got are things that date
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:12.160]   back into the 3000s bce along the coast of peru and there are big stone built pyramids and temples
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.520]   and they're they they're amazingly isolated even now that we've found them uh some of them like corral
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.360]   is one of the most famous ones just north of lima we've known about it for a couple decades now how old
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:32.560]   it is but every time i visit there it's like i've visited the moon there's absolutely nobody there not
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:41.360]   for miles i it's uh amazing how such an a such a discovery was made and yet still nobody goes to see
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.400]   it it's not easy to get to so you think there's a bunch of locations like that some may not have been
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:53.920]   discovered in the peru area oh there are so many peru has tons that desert gets really ugly quick and it
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:00.240]   buries things completely there are so many pyramids out there that are still completely untouched
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:07.600]   you know when people hear the name pyramids they think of egypt immediately but egypt has got about
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:15.680]   140 pyramids and we have pretty much found them all peru has thousands thousands of pyramids and now
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.240]   they weren't built of uh a lot not all of them were built of stone some of them were adobe bricks which
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.200]   have weathered terribly so now they don't look they're they're not exciting places to visit today
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.640]   you know what's funny too you you know we started off talking about you know whether i think there's
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:40.560]   a lost civilization out there uh there are definitely things that are still to be discovered but there
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.080]   are some things that were discovered a hundred years ago and archaeologists or back then they they
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:53.120]   call themselves antiquarians just kind of passed over coral was one of these sites because the the coast of
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:02.720]   peru has some of those pyramids that were made by the moche are full of of gold and beautiful ceramics
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:11.040]   and you know things that you can sell for big money but coral was found a long time ago but the archaeologist
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.760]   was like god no gold no ceramics forget about it this place is no good we can't sell anything here
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:28.240]   and then about the 1970s or 80s somebody said hey no ceramics is that older than the invention of ceramics
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.320]   shit we better go take another look at that place so what's the dating on coral coral i think starts at
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:44.640]   about 3200 bce and it lasts as a major civilization with a lot of other cities around it uh until about
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:51.920]   1800 bce so what's the story behind like looking at some of these images what's the story about
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.560]   constructions like that what was the idea that thing isn't that amazing yeah oh that gosh i mean
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.400]   it should be some sort of you know i'll be a flaky archaeologist like you know this is uh this is a
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:11.520]   place where where rituals took place that's so many things we say are so just painfully vague and
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.480]   that's about you know what we got and a place like this i know the one we're looking at here i've been
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:23.440]   here a couple of times in the pyramid behind it the rubble's built in a way where the building won't
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.520]   rock apart this is a very uh earthquake prone place but the buildings haven't fallen because
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:38.560]   they make these uh net baskets of rocks inside that all kind of wiggle around and don't allow the
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:46.880]   building to fall down and inside these we've also found a couple of things that were uh babies that were
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.480]   human babies that were buried in there and i don't think there's a lot of people that see that and go oh
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:58.080]   look at that they were sacrificing babies these monsters i think a lot of the things that are
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:06.480]   interpreted as baby sacrifices corrals evidence being one of them i think it's more about the the tragic
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:13.680]   nature of infant mortality in the past it was a lot more common there were cultures that didn't even
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.320]   really properly name their kid until they got to five because chances were they were going to die and so i
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.920]   think a lot of these babies that we find in these ceremonial contexts that are interpreted as
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.840]   sacrifices i think they're putting them in special places because they they mourn the death of their
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:38.640]   kids and it just happened a lot more frequently then one of the things you said that really surprised me is
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:45.120]   that pyramids that pyramids were built in peru possibly hundreds of years before they were built in egypt
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:55.600]   that true absolutely absolutely in fact that's crazy there's one that's now pushing uh 6 000 bce
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:05.120]   like that's thousands of years before the stuff in egypt and that one's called waka prieta and it was not a
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:11.840]   a it was not an egyptian pyramid it was but it was a pyramid and it was thousands of years before
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:19.920]   what do you think is the motivation to build a pyramid the fact that it can withstand the elements
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:27.840]   uh structurally that kind of thing is it uh yeah why why do humans build pyramids and why do they build it
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:35.760]   in all kinds of different locations in the world well you know my my root answer is is is pretty boring
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.000]   really a lot of people ask me why are there pyramids all over the planet how is that is that a coincidence
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:52.400]   i mean who yeah i think that uh when people wanted to build a big building without rebar or cement you end up
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:59.360]   building something with a fat base that goes up to a skinny top and that turns into a pyramid uh you know
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.640]   any kid who's playing with blocks on the floor builds a couple towers and his brother knocks them down and
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.200]   if he wants one that's going to stay and be tall he ends up making something with a fat base and a
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:16.800]   and a tiny top and i think that uh you know building something big and tall together is one of those
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:24.160]   those human things like we built that that will be here after we're gone people remember who we were
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:31.120]   we are all if there's any human commonality it's it's fear of our own deaths and that we were nothing
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.040]   and no one will ever remember us i think that the first big monuments like that were probably
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.600]   uh a group of people saying we're going to do something that people will remember forever
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.280]   now that being said you remember we were just talking about waka prieta and this one that's almost
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:55.840]   6000 bc now is the first one that one's a funny case we just talked about all these lofty goals but
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:05.600]   actually i'm pretty sure that waka prieta's first pyramid was about capping a smelly pile of trash
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   i think everybody piled up their trash in the middle of town
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.400]   and it stunk it's it's on the coast it stunk like fish and somebody said if we just bury this thing
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.920]   with dirt it won't smell anymore and then it was a big mound where people could get up and talk to
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:28.320]   everybody and then said well it's squishy you know if we if we cap it with clay then it will really not
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:35.120]   smell i really think that the very first pyramids in peru were about trash management
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:42.240]   talk about plating huh yeah but then they probably saw it and they were impressed and humbled by the
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.200]   sort of the enormity of the construction and they're like oh we should maybe the next guy thought maybe
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:54.160]   we should keep building these kinds of things yeah yeah in uh not not to jump ahead but in north america
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:01.280]   you know where they also made pyramids there's this interesting evolution where there were these piles of
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:07.760]   shells along rivers and along the coastlines people ate a lot of shells that was an easy thing to collect
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:14.480]   and eat so these piles of shells would be near communities and they probably became landmarks but
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:22.240]   eventually they started burying their dead inside those two probably again you know about stink and about
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.280]   you know well we don't want the dogs to eat them maybe put them in the middle of the shell pile but then
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.120]   that all of a sudden became this like that's where my grandfather's body is that's where great
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.560]   grandfather's body is and all of a sudden people started being attached to place not just for the
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:45.440]   resources but for the shared memories of their ancestors so when the very first pyramid was built in
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:54.480]   uh ohio area by the adina people it was built out of dirt but it's full of bodies and i think it's an
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:04.000]   echo of a old thing where they used to be putting bodies in shell mounds so where and who were the
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:12.480]   first civilizations in south america as in america well you know i think we're still piecing that together
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.320]   coming back to the first things we talked about i think we're still missing a lot of stuff especially in
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.080]   south america it just keeps getting older and older part of the reason it's hard to answer that question
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:32.240]   is you know at what point do we consider people a civilization or a culture we have in the americas
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:41.840]   this long period of time that we call the the paleo indian time where they were hunting mega fauna and then
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.200]   when those went away we get into this even longer period of time called the archaic where they're
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.400]   just hunters and gatherers sometimes somebody's coming up with a cool different kind of arrowhead
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.240]   they go back and forth with different hunting tools but really nothing changes for thousands of years
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:07.040]   and then finally they start developing into these larger groups which for the most part has to do with
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.520]   agriculture it used to be archaeology that was just the end all be all civilization starts with the
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.640]   invention of agriculture and we can't have sedentary communities until people learn how to farm but that's
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:28.240]   been discounted peru was a big part of that that area of coral it's connected to another city on the coast
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:36.640]   called aspero and aspero starts about the same time but they're all about fishing they have no farming
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.400]   and coral who's up river from them is farming but funny enough they're not really farming food
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.880]   they're farming cotton and they're making nets and they're trading the nets with the people on the coast
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:57.440]   for the fish so it's not as simple as it's just agriculture anymore but it is i think still rooted in
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:04.240]   how can we feed more people than just our family how can we together create a food abundance
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:11.760]   so we're no longer scared about running out of food so is it possible which is something you've argued
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:23.040]   that civilization started in the amazon in the jungle i do think so i think religion in south america began
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:30.880]   in the amazon i think there were people there very old there's actually uh the earliest pottery in all
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:37.520]   of the americas all these places that we have civilizations that grew up you know where the oldest pottery is
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.080]   the middle of the amazon so there's interesting cultures developing in the amazon so religion
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:52.400]   you would say preceded civilization in south america the uh the corral and aspero that i was just talking
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:59.600]   about it's weird what a dearth of art and any evidence of religion we have we have those pyramids
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.560]   and things that we call temples but we don't really know what went on in there and there's no hints
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:14.320]   of uh religious iconography uh ceremonies nothing like that the first stuff that we get is right when
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:24.720]   that culture ends about 1800 bce this culture called uh shavin starts up and they their main temple is up in
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:33.600]   the andes in this place of uh least path of re least resistance between the amazon and the coast it's about
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:40.400]   three days walk either way from this this place where this temple is that's where we start seeing the very
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.960]   first religious iconography and it's all over the temples there are things that are definitely from the
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:56.000]   coast but the iconography are all jaguars and snakes and crocodiles and those don't come from the coast
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.160]   all of those things are coming out of the amazon i mean religion is a really powerful idea religions
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.760]   are one of the most powerful ideas they're the strongest myths that tie people together and to you
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:18.640]   it's possible that this powerful uh idea in south america started in the amazon i do i do think it did um
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:28.000]   and you're right ideas are more powerful than weapons but archaeology can't see them at all we can see
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   sometimes we can see ideas manifesting in the things they they create and lead to but there's an
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   interpretation problem are we right about what idea created this that those are things that archaeology
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.760]   just can't get at that's one of the challenges of archaeology and looking into ancient histories
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.600]   you're trying to not just understand what they were doing in terms of architecture but understand what
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:37:00.160]   was going on inside their mind that's really what what i'm in it for trying to understand these people
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.800]   and it's real detective work and we know we're dealing with uh a totally flawed record we only
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:14.560]   have what could preserve the test of time you know if we look around this room here if uh if 2000 years
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.120]   of weathering happened in this room what would be left and what would we think happened here
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:30.000]   right right right right but there's not in this room but if you look at thousands of rooms like it maybe
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.040]   you can start to piece things together about the different ideologies that ruled the world uh the
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:44.240]   religions the different ideas uh tell me about this feng deity one of your more controversial ideas is that
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.920]   you believe that the rule the religions there's a thread that connects the different civilizations the
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:38:01.440]   societies of the andean region and the religion that practice is more monotheistic than is currently
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:08.000]   believed in the mainstream that is exactly what i think and it's i think it's all about this fang deity who
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.360]   somewhere thousands of years ago crawled his way out of the amazon up into the andes and
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:20.320]   a religion took hold that could have been kind of a combination of ideas from the coast and the amazon but
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:28.720]   he is the one creator deity in my opinion through all of these cultures and the people in the amazon still
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:36.800]   talk about him there his name is viho masse in some groups but they say that his uh his emissaries on
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.880]   earth are the jaguars and that he is the creator deity why is the current mainstream belief is that
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:51.280]   a lot of the religions are not monotheistic well there are bona fide uh pantheons you know greece had
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:58.560]   one egypt had one mesopotamia had one lots of the early religions of the old world were
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:05.440]   pantheons and i think that was part of the problem the earliest archaeologists walked in there with a
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.200]   preconceived notion that ancient cultures have pantheons and so they went to the art looking for
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:19.280]   them and they came up with things like the shark god and the moon goddess and the sun god and all these
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.880]   things but when i look at the art and i was trained by a person right here in austin texas as an art historian
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:35.520]   you follow certain uh diagnostic traits through art to see the development over time and when i look at
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:42.960]   it and use that methodology there's a single face with goggle eyes and fangs and claws on his hands and
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:50.640]   feet and snakes coming off of his head and off of his belt he's he's got really identifiable traits he also
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.880]   likes to sever people's heads off and carry them around but he's the fanged deity and he's there
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:04.560]   he shows up in chavin de juantar the capital of that chavin culture and he keeps showing up through
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:14.960]   every culture even thousands of miles away throughout the next two millennium right up to the inca the inca have
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:25.600]   a creator deity they call viracocha but viracocha is the fang deity he is when we do see him by the time
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:32.880]   you get to inca they do this kind of like almost uh islamic thing where they say you you can't understand
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:41.360]   the face of viracocha so when they do put him in a cosmogram they'll make him just a blob like he's just
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.680]   unknowable but he's at the very top i think we're misunderstanding a lot of things that we used to
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:55.520]   say were deities as just supernatural beings if we flip the mirror on christianity and take a look at
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.840]   it which of course christianity's monotheistic right it would be heresy to say otherwise but who are all
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:08.960]   these other characters who are all these angels and demons and you know jesus christ and i mean i don't
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:15.280]   even know who the holy spirit is but he's some sort of supernatural being but it's that monotheistic
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:23.920]   system has lots of things that have supernatural powers that are not god that's where i think the
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:32.880]   crux of us misunderstanding ancient andean art is so what is the process of analyzing art through time
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.640]   to try to try to figure out what the important entities are for that culture you just see what
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:45.200]   shows up over and over and over and over well certainly without the uh advent of writing
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:55.360]   uh depictions in art have all sorts of meanings encoded in them and there are certain you know what we call
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:04.080]   diagnostic elements like we can we can pull apart the same sort of thing in uh like in the greek pantheon
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.280]   you know you know by their dress and what they're holding what the different gods are you can tell hades
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:16.160]   from from zeus by the different things they're holding you know lightning bolts or tridents or whatever
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   it is so they all have these diagnostic elements to them so that's how art history goes about
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.320]   analyzing art over time once once we can put it in a chronological sequence then we can say
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:39.200]   okay here's here's a deity here in shavin culture now we move forward 500 years now we're in moche and nazca
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:47.840]   culture you know who are who where are the deities here and what i see is that same guy with not just
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:55.200]   one or two traits but a whole package of them that shows up again and again and again for thousands of
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:04.720]   years in each one of these cultures he's got circular eyes he's got a fanged mouth he's got claws on his hands
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:12.480]   and feet he's a he's a humanoid but he also has uh snakes coming off of his head like hair and snakes
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:20.320]   coming off of his belt and then not so much in shavin but as it goes forward he starts carting around
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:29.840]   uh severed heads human severed heads so they're like in the old literature uh the moche will call
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:36.400]   him the decapitator deity but then they have these other like oh here's the crab deity and here's the
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:43.600]   fox deity but if you look at them like the crab deity is just that guy's face coming off of a crab
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:50.800]   and the fox deity is that guy's face coming off of a fox so i think in on that particular instance i
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.240]   explain it similar to what zeus did you know how zeus was able to like you know turn into whatever
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.800]   animal he wanted to get with the woman he wanted and he showed up in all sorts of forms but he was
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   always zeus i think that the uh the fang deity manifests himself through people and animals
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.200]   throughout the art and that there are missing stories of mythology that we don't have anymore
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.520]   and across hundreds of years thousands of years from shavin to mocha to inca as you're saying right
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:29.920]   wari has them too tiwanako that's that famous place pumapunku he's all over there i wonder how
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:40.080]   those ideas spread and morph of this fang deity i think people walked and proselytized and places like
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:47.200]   shavin there's a later one in inca times called uh pachacamac that are pilgrimage places where people come in
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.840]   to be healed if they're sick but also just to pay homage to the powers that be so
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:00.640]   uh shavin was a place where people from the amazon and people from the coast were all coming together in
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:08.320]   fact we saw it in the archaeology there there's these interesting labyrinths under the pyramids with
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:14.000]   the fang deity all over them that have like one labyrinth they'll have all pottery the next labyrinth
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.720]   they'll have a bunch of animal bones the next one will have a bunch of things made out of stone so
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.960]   people are showing up and giving this tribute and they're learning and then they're going back to
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:31.680]   their community so i think it dispersed from certain pilgrimage spots and became just like pilgrimage
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:38.960]   spots do somebody goes back and they build a temple to the fang deity do we know much about the
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:46.880]   relationship they had with the fang deity and like their conception of the powers of the fang deity is
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:58.080]   it were they afraid of the fang deities and all-knowing god is it uh something that brings joy and harvest
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:04.640]   or is it something that you're supposed to be afraid of and sacrifice animals and humans to to keep it keep at
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:11.520]   the way i think he has two sides of the coin like a lot of the the hindu gods are you know one aspect
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:18.160]   is terrible the other aspect is lovely um i think he had that same sorts of qualities because we do see
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.320]   him as a fierce warrior taking people's heads off and he is a jaguar which in and of itself implies a
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.440]   certain power and ferocity but then there are other funny things about him like he is definitely involved
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:37.280]   in a lot of healing ceremonies and a lot of those healing ceremonies are involved with uh sex acts
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:43.680]   when it comes to the moche there's this whole group of sexual pottery where priests are having sex with
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:53.920]   women or men um and some of them show their faces transforming into that fang deity like he is acting through them
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:02.400]   but the the thing that most cracks me up that shows his softer side is the fang deity has a little puppy
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:08.800]   he has a puppy that's like just dancing around his feet and like jumping up on him in various scenes
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.960]   they see him again and again sometimes he's in these these healing sex scenes in fact i tracked that
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:22.720]   puppy from other contexts to these sex scenes where the uh where a priest was having sex with somebody
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.480]   in a house and there's a fang deity and there's a puppy just scratching at the door like hey you forgot
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:35.920]   me and then finally one day i found one with the puppy having sex with the woman instead of the fang deity
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:41.840]   i was like no he really is very involved in this what is this weird puppy so he's okay yeah he likes
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.880]   to take heads off but he also has a puppy he adores this actually this is awesomely makes sense now
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:55.600]   because i i saw the opening of a paper you wrote 30 years ago on shamanism and motor civilization it reads
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:01.520]   the mocha are the major focus of this paper sex puppies and head hunting will be shown to be related
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:08.080]   to ancient mocha shamanism uh so now i understand i was like with the puppies puppies yeah
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.840]   all right uh and the head hunting that's the decapitator and i've added rock and roll to that list since
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.760]   actually which is rock and roll or you know music is also a big part of it they they oh interesting
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.320]   they they call spirits down there's this whole spirit world there's the ancestors
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:31.520]   and the the people that drink san pedro cactus juice kind of they don't talk about the fang deity
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:38.480]   anymore i think christianity in 500 years has somewhat put him in the back you know it was
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:43.920]   unpopular to have a pagan deity so they don't talk about him much anymore though he's still around
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:54.400]   they're in like around trujillo they call him i iopec but um music play in the amazon they play flutes
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:01.200]   sometimes a chorus of women sing and that's supposed to bring the spirits down into the ceremony there's
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:07.280]   a spirit that's hurting the person that's sick and then the the priest or the shaman or the corandero
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:14.320]   whatever you want to call him has his own posse of spirits that are going to help him figure out
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:22.000]   what's going on so when the music starts that's bringing those spirits in and people don't see them
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   unless they've imbibed the san pedro cactus juice which is this hallucinogen which is in the amazon
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.880]   side it was ayahuasca on the amazon on the coast it was san pedro cactus but that's what allows you to
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:47.040]   actually see that other world yeah i i went to the amazon recently did ayahuasca uh very high dose of
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.720]   it bold move
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:59.360]   um when in rome well how far back does that go oh i i think longer than anybody can remember but i mean
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.960]   it's a natural plant that's been there forever i think that it's thousands and thousands of years that's
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.560]   another thing uh shavin de juantara was talking about where i think the things came the religion
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:18.560]   came from the amazon there's this wall on the back side that faces the amazon side so if you're entering
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:25.200]   the city from the amazon path you see this wall first and it's a bunch of faces that some of them are human
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:32.080]   some of them are total jaguar and some of them are trans forming in between but there's a group of them
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:41.120]   that are midway through transformation and they show their nostrils leaking out this snot that's coming
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:49.360]   like down their face san pedro doesn't do that to you but ayahuasca does ayahuasca traditionally they'd
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:56.080]   take a blow gun and just shoot it up your nose or up your ass but it was a lot of times up your nose
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.680]   and when it shoots up your nose the first thing that happens is just this gush of snot comes out of you
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:09.280]   and there are stone uh depictions of people uncontrollably snotting on the back side of
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:15.840]   this temple from you know 3 000 years ago so that you think could have been a big component
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:23.840]   of the development of religion and shamanism i think that hallucinogens opened the mind then like
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.600]   they opened the mind now do you think that you know the stone ape theory uh do you think that actually
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   could have been an actual catalyst for the formation of uh civilization in the americas yes i do though
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:47.040]   you know hallucinogens are not part of every uh ancient tradition in the world in fact strangely the
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:53.520]   majority of plants that that are actually psychotropic not just mood altering are from
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   here in the americas there there are very few uh drugs that will make you hallucinate outside of the
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.280]   americas of course now they're global and you know they're they can be grown all over the place but
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:13.680]   originally speaking very very few were outside of the americas so they were part of the experience
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.280]   here in a way that they just couldn't be in other places i wonder to what degree they were just part
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:26.640]   of a ritual and the creative force behind sort of art versus like literally
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:34.880]   the method by which you come up with ideas that define a civilization it's like the degree to which
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:40.560]   they had a role in the formation of civilizations it's kind of fun to think about psychedelics being
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:48.960]   like a critical role in formation of civilizations i think in terms of south america they probably
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:55.360]   really were um in north america where we're in a more northern climb here and there are less of them
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.760]   not so much at least in terms of psychedelics things like uh you know tobacco was always a big part of it
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:08.560]   but a lot of the you know there's there's more than one way to meet to reach a hallucinatory state the
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:16.320]   hard way is starvation uh sleep deprivation and for the the maya for example would go
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:23.760]   sleep deprivation starvation and then they cut themselves very badly and that loss of blood we
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:31.440]   believe triggered hallucinations and visions nothing to do with drugs i would much prefer the drugs route
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:39.200]   it's there's it's the result not the uh the tools aren't the thing that creates insight it's the the
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.960]   result so you're getting to you know it it's hallucinogens are poisoning us they're killing us
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:53.520]   that's you know it's a it's a near death state and people of the americas believed sleeping was entering
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:54:00.880]   that other world death you entered this other world and that when you took this mighty dose of poison it was
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:07.360]   helping you enter that other world for a period of time yeah as tom wade said in that one song i like
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:15.440]   my town with a little drop of poison so maybe that poison is a good uh catalyst for invention so who
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:25.200]   were the early first sort of mother cultures mother civilizations in south america like what what is
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:34.240]   if we look chronologically is there a label we can put on the first peoples that emerged that picture is
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:39.840]   evolving i mean forever it was just the shavin people that we've been talking about the ones with
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:45.760]   all the first depictions of religious art were the mother culture and they certainly did transmit a lot
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   of stuff but then all of a sudden we find uh coral the next one that we've barely even begun looking at
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:55:00.320]   but it's probably older than coral is sachin culture i was just poking around there last year and
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:08.720]   just just from the bus on the highway i could see like that's a pyramid out there well oh there's
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:13.280]   another one and i know how old the stuff we have studied there is it's again
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:21.520]   3000 bc we're just barely beginning to understand them corral frustrates me to no end the lack of art
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:29.440]   there that's we've got you know stones and bones and not even ceramics to go on and they didn't have the
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:35.120]   courtesy to leave me a bunch of art i can interpret so i don't know what those people believed right so
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.760]   one of the ways to understand what people believe is looking at the art the stories told through the art
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   and then hopefully uh deciphering if they were doing any kind of writing that's our most fruitful place
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:53.760]   to try to get at this elusive ideas yeah and it sucks when they don't have art if we just go back
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.960]   to the amazon you've mentioned that it's possible that there's a lost civilization that existed in the
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:06.320]   amazon so it's carried a lot of names lost city of z or el dorado do you think it's possible it existed
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:14.560]   well city of z and el dorado are in pretty different places that one el dorado the the ideas of where it
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:22.720]   is kind of center around towards colombia okay and the city of z is named after a region of brazil called
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:32.400]   the shingu and so those those are uh a an america worth of distance apart you know the entire people
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.160]   don't really think about it on the map but the entire united states would fit inside the amazon
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:44.240]   that's how big that place is yeah and these two are on either end but both of them have evidence of
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:51.120]   civilizations these big you know it's it's it's lowland and it floods all the time so what they
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:57.760]   did is they'd make these big mounds and then they'd make huge causeways between mounds so they could
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:04.240]   walk through their cities while they were seasonally inundated and a bunch of that stuff has been found
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:11.920]   in the shingu area like huge areas that would support tens of thousands of people again you know it's not
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   stone built and it's been under the forest forever so it's very torn up but it's there now you know
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:27.040]   brazil is big on cattle farming more than ever now and a a thing that i think is completed now is brazil
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:36.480]   and bolivia partnered together and built a highway all the way across and opened up a whole bunch more
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:43.920]   land which has found more of these what we call like uh geometric earthworks so there's more and more
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:50.720]   evidence of these civilizations it's not a it's not it could be there it's there for sure by the way the
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.600]   people who are trying to protect the rainforest really hate the highway one of the things i learned is if
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:04.320]   you build a road uh loggers will come yep and they will start cutting stuff down now from an archaeology
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:11.280]   perspective if you cut down trees you get to discover things but from a sort of protect a very precious
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:19.520]   rainforest perspective it's obviously the opposite way but it is interesting i've seen where loggers cut
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:28.160]   through the forest and then they uh and when they leave the forest heals itself very quickly so quickly
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:36.880]   and you know you just think that across decades you expand that to centuries and it's like you could see
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:44.000]   how a civilization could be completely swallowed up by the rainforest and it happened for sure in the amazon
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.160]   yeah you know they're one of the ways that we're trying to push the frontier of where people were in
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:59.520]   the amazon because yes the uh the trees and just the biomass have eaten so much evidence but they're finding
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:07.680]   more and more of these places that they call uh terra preta which is black earth and they're huge swaths of
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:18.320]   it so uh i guess the anthropology term is anthropogenic landscapes and what they're saying is that that
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:24.240]   really dark earth couldn't have just got that way through natural forest processes that sometime in the
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:30.720]   distant past that forest wasn't there and there was major farming and human activity to the point
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:38.480]   where they totally turned the soil black and it's much more enriched and uh when i when i took a trip
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:45.360]   into the amazon i took i went from manaos up the river the black river a couple of days and went and met some
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:52.320]   different communities and i asked them about this black earth and they were like yeah that's why we're here
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:59.600]   sometimes we move our village but when we move we look for the terra preta and that's where we're
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.560]   going to put our village because that's a place that all of our gardens work the other places they don't
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.160]   one of the things you talked about literally just asked you have to ask the right question
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:14.560]   and uh the stories all the all the secrets are carried by the people and they will tell you
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:20.800]   yeah there's so many of them you know the the thing that excites the world about archaeology right now
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:29.040]   is gobekli tepi and this you know 10 000 now koran tepi is 11 000 the whole area is called the tas tepler
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:35.120]   we only found it a couple of decades ago but it was just you know a archaeologist roaming through the
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.800]   area and ask a sheep herder hey you know you guys know where anything ancient is oh yeah let me let me
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.320]   show you this and then all of a sudden we've got a lost civilization and the and the shepherds always knew
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.560]   where it was just nobody asked him so speaking of gobekli tepi uh what do you think about the work of
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:01:01.600]   graham hancock who also believes that uh there's a lost civilization in the amazon well uh i've met graham
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.880]   um and personally i like him he's a nice guy got a nice sense of humor and i think he's smart
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:15.680]   um and and i also think he is a a very good researcher he and i are working on the same
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:24.320]   set of facts the differences are interpretations i do not believe graham's uh idea that a single
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:31.520]   now lost ancient civilization seeded the rest of them i just don't see that on a number of levels
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   artifact wise technology wise art historical analysis so i think his research is great um i think that he's
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:48.720]   he's very well read in fact better read than a lot of my colleagues but uh his conclusions i disagree with
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:55.360]   and he and i have talked about this and uh had a very civil and normal conversation about it and agreed
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:02.560]   to disagree without spitting any venom at any point in the conversation that would be a fun uh argument to
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:09.200]   be a fly on the wall for uh so he he believes he's proposed as possible that the amazon jungle is uh
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.400]   sort of a man-made garden so it was planted there by advanced ancient civilization is there any degree to
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   which that could be possible frankly i agree with him i mean it's just like what i was just talking
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.960]   about the the it's the conclusion part that we differ from sure but the facts that he's basing that on
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:39.200]   are that terra preta are the huge geometric earthworks are the ever-increasing evidence of them they are now
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:47.920]   from you know the bottom of bolivia to uh guyana they're everywhere every time we open up the jungle
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:55.200]   we find these big works so yes there was a vast civilization that was there how advanced they were
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:07.440]   is uh is a question and also you know a perspective thing graham really focuses in on what we don't know
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.920]   and what could be what's the just to educate me what's what's the key idea that he's proposing that
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.360]   you disagree with is that it was the level of advancement the civilization was or how large and
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:26.400]   centralized it was uh my main point of disagreement is that his and his ideas evolve like everybody's you
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:34.080]   know it no no scientist or researcher in anything has an idea at the beginning of their career and holds it
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.920]   until the day they die his ideas are evolving but his ideas remain a core of them are that there was a
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:51.520]   very advanced single ancient civilization that was utterly destroyed by climactic conditions and uh the
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:58.480]   the younger dryer uh dryest hypothesis is part of that most recently he used to not say that now he's into
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:11.120]   this meteor thing but he believes that that civilization was destroyed but that uh members of it escaped this
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.400]   cataclysm and then spread out all over the world to cede all of the world civilizations for the next
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:25.520]   revival there's where i disagree with him i think these were independent civilizations that grew up
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:33.840]   uh in their own ways that they were not ceded by some more advanced civilization from the past and that they all
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:41.440]   hold things in common because they have this common ancestry of uh you know in his early books he suggested
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:50.240]   it's the it's atlantis i don't think he suggests that anymore but he still hangs on to the single advanced
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:57.360]   now completely lost civilization and you know archaeology is so we we don't have you know we're all of our
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:04.240]   ideas are theories very few of them are facts and we're not you know we could have the story wrong but
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:10.800]   one thing we're real good at is finding stuff i mean we find fish scales so i find it just
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:18.560]   too big a pill to swallow that there was a civilization that was that technologically advanced and that large
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:27.440]   that we can't even find a potsherd from yeah and of course it is a compelling story that there's a
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:34.720]   single civilization from which all of this came from because the alternative is you know the idea that
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:43.280]   we came across the bearing strait from asia went all the way down to south america and got isolated
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:50.640]   and created all these marvelous sophisticated civilizations and ideas including religious ideas
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:59.600]   that looks similar to other you know everybody has a flood myth right right so like there's a lot of
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:10.640]   similarities everybody building pyramids yeah uh but there could be a lot of other explanations and for
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:16.080]   uh even if it's a simple compelling explanation there has to be evidence for it right and what would that
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.880]   evidence that's the bottom line i mean everything's theories where we're and and as responsible
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   scientists we're trying to disprove our theories we are not supposed to be trying to prove our theories
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:33.680]   that's that's one more foot out of the science box that archaeology often steps where we're supposed
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:40.560]   to be disproving what we think is happening not proving it yeah you don't want to lean into the mystery
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.840]   too much i mean most of it's essential it's such a weird discipline because you're operating in a
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:52.000]   it's like really in a dark room you're feeling around a dark room so it's mostly mystery
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.360]   i would say a lot of sciences operate we're in a mostly well-lit room it's like a dark corner
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:07.120]   and you're kind of uh figuring out a way to light it but in yeah in archaeology it's most of it is a
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:14.480]   mystery right yes it's job security i like that part you know but i i do also try to always remind
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:24.000]   myself that every paradigm shifting idea that humans has have ever had began as heresy and lunacy you know
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.560]   that guy was crazy up to the second he was brilliant and so we got to keep our minds open to
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:38.560]   the things that sound outlandish because one of them eventually is going to lead us to the big paradigm
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:45.440]   shift and if we you know if we're busy burning books of ideas that we don't like that's where we close
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.240]   our minds to the possibility of advancing things i really love that and i really appreciate that you're
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:58.320]   saying that um one of the fascinating things about just the amazon to me is that there's still a large
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:06.560]   number of uncontacted tribes as to rewind back into ancient history you can imagine all of these tribes
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:14.720]   that existed in the amazon that were uh isolated very sort of distinct from each other can you speak to
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:21.840]   this your understanding of these uh tribes and their history they're still here today well a lot of them
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:29.040]   are these you know by uncontacted we mean we don't know anything about these guys we know roughly where
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:35.600]   they are but places like ecuador have very responsible policies where no one's allowed to go contact them
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:41.200]   so we have a dearth of information if they walk out of the jungle and talk to us that's one thing
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.680]   but we don't go out and they're looking for them but they do seem you know frozen in time and i don't
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:54.640]   think any of us have a good estimation of how long they've been like that but you know we were saying
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:01.040]   earlier that you know humans change based on pressures of their environment you know it's a
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:09.680]   mother necessity is oftentimes how we invent things or why we change its pressure and one thing the amazon is
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:16.640]   once you you know figure out how not to die in it it's a paradise of food food's fallen from the sky
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:22.880]   all the time there and if once you learn to adapt to that environment you've got very little need
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:30.080]   there's no pressure to make anything else things are working so for the modern humans that come across
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.800]   these uncontacted tribes one of the things they document and notice is the propensity of these tribes for
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:43.280]   violence so they get very aggressive in in attacking whoever they come across and not just foreigners
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:50.720]   they attack each other the yanamamo are famous for just having never ending feuds with each other
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:10:00.080]   what do you think is the philosophy behind that i don't you know i'm a relatively peaceful person but i've
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:07.120]   got you know i've got the monster in me like everybody does and uh i i think that these you
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:15.440]   know it's cultural norms that become institutionalized for the yanamamo they really part of the pat the
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:24.480]   rite of passage to be a man is to go kill or maim somebody from an outer village and they go in there they
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:31.680]   they they oftentimes uh the the way they don't let uh inbreeding set in and ruin everybody not that they
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:38.640]   think of it scientifically but they they typically go and steal women from far off communities and that
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.960]   starts a big fight another thing that starts fights that when nobody even fought is illness
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:52.880]   illness illness in the amazon and all of the ancient americas wasn't seen as a biological thing it was a
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:11:00.640]   spiritual thing so if somebody in your village gets sick the question is asked well what spirit is
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:07.440]   menacing him and who called it out on him and then the rumor starts well i bet you it was joe over
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.840]   there in that other community he's still pissed off for that time when we stole his daughter yeah and we
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:18.480]   ought to go over there and kill joe yeah and then he'll get better and so this this uh this round of
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:26.640]   never-ending violence uh like hatfields and mccoy's had that thing and the uh the people of uh new guinea
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:34.240]   also do that so it's not you know there are certain areas uh mostly wooded areas now that i think about
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:43.520]   it where people just hide out and they attack each other as a cultural uh institution it's such a tricky
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:50.160]   thing to do to study an uncontacted tribe without obviously contacting them to figure out their language
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.880]   their philosophy of mind how they communicate the hierarchy they operate under and yeah you know there
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.440]   was a fascinating story in peru i guess it was probably like eight years ago or something but there
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:09.120]   was a a ranger from one of the biology stations who just in the by-and-by of uh protecting his area
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.640]   met one of these uncontacted tribes and befriended someone not the whole tribe but he made some friends
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:20.080]   who would meet him in the woods not in their community and he started to learn their language over
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:27.200]   couple years and so he was this kind of important guy who actually could be the first translator to
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.520]   talk to these people and one day a couple of them just came out of the woods and just plugged him with
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.080]   arrows and just killed him and then they went back in the woods like that's the one guy who understands
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:44.960]   what we're saying we should kill him and move our village so those folks really lean into the uh as
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:52.880]   you said the monster versus the uh the puppy you know everybody's got it i i think i think uh you know
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:13:03.200]   we we need to listen to our better angels because if we don't we we we as a human species can easily
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:10.160]   devolve into just using violence and against others to get what we want we it's a it's a daily choice we
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.080]   make not to be savages which is a fascinating thing to remember what kind of thing in civilized society
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:27.120]   we've moved past all that but it can uh it can be summoned like in uh uh 1984 the two minutes of hate
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:37.360]   with the right words that primal thing can be summoned and directed uh and lead to a lot of
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:44.720]   destruction and you know our our sports are really based on taking those kinds of urges and channeling
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:55.920]   them positive where somebody's not dead at the end of it yep uh so at which point did what we now call
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:04.720]   the maya civilization arise ah that's a that's another complicated one another group living mostly in a
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:12.560]   jungle that we have barely begun to explore you know the truth is a lot of the questions in the amazon and
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:19.040]   and and what we're talking about now is the paten and the mountains there those aren't places archaeologists
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.400]   want to live they're horrible i mean i've been there i don't want to live in a tent and eat rations
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.920]   i want to live in a nice town so a lot of the places where the answers are we still really haven't gotten
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.720]   there because it takes a special person to be educated enough to know what they're looking at and
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:41.600]   tough enough to want to be there i've done my tour of duty i'm now in a nice little podcast studio
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:50.960]   um but seriously the the maya the first hint that we see people who are culturally maya very close to
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:57.120]   where the time period for that chavin culture is about 1800 bce there's a culture that some call the
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:06.480]   mo kaya not maya but uh they're on the pacific coast uh where guatemala and mexico connect it's called the
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:12.480]   soconusco and those are the first people that are really going to be culturally maya and they're
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:19.760]   interacting with the culture that has traditionally been seen as mexico's mother culture which is the
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.080]   olmec they're kind of the same thing as we were talking about in south america where the the maya
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:33.520]   the original maya are not there's not a whole lot to indicate that they have a religion um but the olmec
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.200]   have this religion they develop and they start exporting it and you see the maya become more and
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:45.120]   more involved in in the religion that's being created by the olmec who are to the north of them
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:51.600]   in the swamps of what we call the isthmus of tuantapac i have a lot of questions to ask here
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.720]   about just a natural stupid confusion i have so first uh did the maya or the all might come first
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:08.720]   and are they distinct groups like how do you maintain a distinct civilization when you're so close together
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.600]   i i just finished filming a whole thing on the olmecs and their interaction with the maya for the
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:23.120]   great courses i'm thrilled for it to come out next spring um i think they co-evolved archaeology in this
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:29.920]   regard is the worst enemy of this we we put these names on cultures we we talk about how they evolve
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:36.480]   from one to another we draw these lines where there aren't any we make these time periods that a culture
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.120]   magically transforms into somebody with another name where i'm pretty sure they didn't care about
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:49.920]   any of those names but the the maya and the olmec are two parts of a larger interaction sphere that's
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:57.200]   happening in mesoamerica a very dynamic time the olmec are really bringing the religion part but the
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:06.560]   other areas are bringing technology ceramic technology uh making hematite mirrors making uh tools out of
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:16.080]   obsidian and other uh other stone types so you've got the olmec in the middle where where mexico gets
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.200]   skinny and it gets swampy down there that's called the isthmus of tehuantepec that's where the olmec are
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:27.600]   then you've got the maya to the east of them then you have the valley of oaxaca where the people called
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:34.160]   the zapotex they're rising up and then you have the valley of mexico which will eventually become the
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.080]   aztecs but not for millennia all those areas are interacting with each other
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.840]   can we just also draw some more lines yeah sure so what is mesoamerica what is south america
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:55.280]   uh and what you just said to omics and the the maya like can we just linger on the geography that we're
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:01.920]   talking about here in the what is this like a thousand bc um yeah the time period we're talking about
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:09.840]   where the the olmec are there a thousand bc is a great uh midpoint of it i'd say it starts about 1800 bce
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:20.480]   and by 500 bce the olmec are gone and a whole new wave of civilization and population increase happen
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:28.960]   in terms of mesoamerica looking at your map here i'd say about halfway through the chihuahua desert up there
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:38.560]   in the top left that's that's about the boundary of uh mesoamerica there's this big desert where almost
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:45.680]   nobody lives and once you get north enough you get into the ancestral pueblo people of what's now america
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:52.080]   the the four corners area they're not mesoamerican they have different lives where does modern mexico end
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.520]   modern mexico ends right you know you see the name maya there with the white line around it that's
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.560]   guatemala so guatemala cuts off most of mexico from central america got it but mesoamerica only goes
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:14.000]   about halfway through honduras and then it's really kind of a no man's land uh uh nicaragua costa rica
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:21.680]   panama they really uh they're neither they're not mesoamerica they're not south america they're more
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:27.440]   south america because they've got some gold there but then basically you get on the other side of panama
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:33.280]   and you're you're fully in south america with two distinct groups too you've got the guys that are on
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:41.520]   the andes on the west coast and then you have the amazon so the the west the andes is and the amazon are
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:47.920]   very distinct so when you say when you refer to the andean region is that referring to the andes and the
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:55.520]   amazon or just the andes just the andes the the and the and the coast that to to the pacific there
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:04.080]   that's that's andean civilization so did maya make it to the andes the andean region not that archaeology
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.840]   can prove but it's almost certain that they interact with each other number one it's just you know
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:15.360]   it's biased to think that these people couldn't travel as widely as people on the other side of
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:21.120]   the planet did but there's all sorts of hints like uh that first ceramics i was talking about that the
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:31.600]   maya made they show up strangely uh sophisticated technologically already and down in ecuador they had
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:39.440]   them for a thousand years before so a lot of people myself included think that the idea of ceramics actually
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.880]   that the maya came from south america to the maya did the maya get seeded by the second wave
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:56.080]   across the bering strait or did that initial wave of people that came and uh populated south america
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:03.680]   were they the ancestors of the maya like how did the migration happen here do we understand we're still
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.720]   piecing it together i don't think you know i'd be lying if i told you i had the answers but we do
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:15.360]   have evidence of maya stature people there are small people generally speaking people that grow
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.560]   up in the forest are smaller and people that grow up in the open plains are taller probably about you
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.600]   know just generations of people that hit their head on a branch or not
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.160]   uh you're joking but you know there could be something i think there's some truth to it i mean
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:36.480]   the pygmies are small and the people on the plains in africa are big the north american indians are tall
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:43.040]   and the maya are small it's there is there's definitely a pattern of smaller people in the forests
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:53.120]   but anyway um there's a cave in the yucatan called lul tune cave that has uh hand prints in the cave
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.840]   it's somebody who put their hand on the cave and spit charcoal around their hand like a negative print
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:07.440]   yep we can date that charcoal and it comes from 10 000 years ago and the hands are all small it's you know
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.440]   typical old mexico i i walked right up to these things and could put my hand i didn't you know
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:19.680]   mess with them but i put my hand next to these hands and they're all smaller than my you know northern
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:27.120]   european hand and so either it was a bunch of kids who were in this cave 10 000 years ago or it was people
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:35.200]   of maya stature who did it it's so cool that you can date the charcoal and it's so cool that 10 000
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:42.480]   years ago there were people leaving and and actually we have uh one that's i think 2 000 years older now
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:49.840]   just a couple years ago again in yucatan in a cave they found a woman they named naia now and she's like
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:23:01.280]   12 000 years old so the best guess maybe that you have is it goes across the bering strait to south america
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.760]   possibly the amazon develop a lot of cool ideas in the amazon and start drifting back up into mesoamerica
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:14.880]   was kind of a co-evolution the the technology of ceramics i think got there through an interaction
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:20.960]   with see the interesting thing is that the maya didn't really have religion didn't have as a vibrant
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:27.840]   religious set of ideas and they borrowed it from the all mike i've been doing a deep dive on this for this
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:36.000]   all my course that i just did and it really does seem like um these other cultures that have jade and
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.560]   hematite and obsidian the the olmec had none of that stuff they were living in a swamp and building things
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:51.120]   out of uh dirt but they were importing those materials from those areas carving them into all sorts of
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:58.000]   religious iconography and then exporting them back to them and still the fang deity show up no the fang
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.640]   deities nowhere in uh in central america and mesoamerica that's why there's there's jaguars there's
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:12.560]   jaguar iconography but it's not the same thing this this whole jaguar transformer deity does not exist there
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:19.840]   they do have a pantheon so the maya the olmecs are the interesting peoples of the regions what was their
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:27.040]   uh i'd love to ask questions about who were they so one question i'm curious about what was their sense
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.960]   when they looked up at the stars what was their conception of the cosmos
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:40.480]   uh that's a question i've spent my entire career trying to answer i i think that they saw it as
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:49.360]   proof of the cyclical nature of life and certainly they saw like every ancient group did like are those
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:56.160]   the gods why are those things so far away but i think that the maya especially looked at it in a
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:04.560]   with a much more mathematical mind than most did and so they watched these things move every night
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:13.280]   and if you do that even today you notice that all the stars move in tandem they're just this blanket
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.200]   they're like they're they're like this curtain behind me they're the stage upon which some very important
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:26.880]   players are dancing and that's the moon the sun and the planets there's five planets we can see visibly
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:34.560]   so they started watching like why are just those seven moving differently than the rest and those are
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.840]   the things that they keyed on mathematically the the sun of course was also involved in the agricultural
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:47.440]   cycle so that was important in and of itself but the the planets we can see them coming up with ideas
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:56.160]   definitely doing the math and seeing that there's a repeated cycle and then coming up with mythology
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:04.800]   around them like venus for them was associated with war and they had very ritualized times to go to war
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:12.240]   that had something to do with venus sometimes in the classic period maya it was the first appearance of
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.760]   venus as the morning star that was a good time to go to to battle with your neighbors and when it
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   became the post-classic with like chichen itza being the capital of the yucatan then it looks like if you
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:33.840]   watch venus day after day it goes slowly up every day and then when it hits its highest point as morning
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.720]   star in the in the morning it goes down to the earth like three times as fast all of a sudden it just
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:48.480]   shoots down and hits the earth and so the the people of post-classic maya civilization saw that as the
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:55.440]   gods shooting a spear into the earth and that was a good time to attack your neighbors that was like
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:03.280]   war time when the spear is going to hit the earth all right so this is fascinating they just had at the
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:11.040]   the foundation a sense that life existence at the various timescales is cyclical yeah that's that's
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:16.160]   the starting point and then you just look out there and if you're extremely precise which is fascinating
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:25.280]   how precise they were you can just measure the uh the cycles yeah and they did it really well now of course they they
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:32.720]   are the only ones to develop a fully elaborated writing system in all of the americas the south
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.960]   america had the kipu but it's so different than our writing we're still trying to figure out what the
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:44.000]   heck it is we know there's math there too but they had the ability to take a lifetime worth of measurements
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.840]   and hand it to the next generation who would then do it more and do it more that's how they figured out
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:55.840]   kind of the holy grail of ancient astronomy how good were they was whether they could see the
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:03.280]   procession of the equinoxes the fact that we're just barely wobbling and there's a 26 000 year period
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:09.680]   where the stars as that backdrop will spin all the way around and come back it's 26 000 years
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:17.840]   but the maya were able to figure out wait it's moving one degree every 72 years and did a calculation
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:24.640]   based on uh on on where it should be in the ancient past and they're using constellations
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:34.080]   they're showing us they know by saying like this planet's in this constellation right now and 33 000 years
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:42.400]   ago it would be in this constellation it's just fascinating that they were able to figure this out
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:50.080]   i would love to sort of understand the details of the scientific community uh if you can call it that
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.800]   i think we absolutely could and uh that's actually one of the things that i'm i'm hoping to move the needle
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:05.600]   on in my generation with my career is to give these cultures the the respect they deserve as standing toe
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:12.400]   to toe with the rest of our ancient civilizations we respect there are things that should be called
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.760]   science that are not being called science at the moment they're you know their math is incredible
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:23.840]   their their hydraulic engineering is incredible their chemistry is incredible and so
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:31.680]   i hope to talk about these things differently as a way to get people to recognize the achievements
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:38.000]   in a different way yeah i mean unquestionably incredible scientific work in the in the astronomy
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:45.200]   sense uh especially here can you speak to the all the sophisticated aspects of the mayan calendar
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:52.080]   uh that they've developed i don't know you got another five hours let's go i should uh no i'm kidding i
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:30:00.640]   i should say that you also gave me uh the 2024 mayan calendar yeah i do this just to you know show the
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:08.240]   world that that calendar system is evergreen it can go into the future or the past for billions
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.440]   of years in the system they made just like our system is so can you speak to the three components
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:19.840]   here as i'm reading the tzolkin the hob and the long count what are these fascinating components of the
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:26.640]   calendar it's it's a neat how obsessed they they were really math nerds they it wasn't good enough
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:33.440]   for them to just make one cycle to describe time yeah they had all these cycles that that interlocked
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:41.600]   into each other like like cogs in a machine though they never thought of it like that but uh the tzolkin's
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:47.120]   their oldest one and the one that still endures today there are millions of maya people that are
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:55.920]   living their lives based on a 260 day count no weeks no months it's just 13 numbers combined with
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:03.600]   20 day names for a total of 260 days and then it goes again everybody in the highlands knows what their
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.680]   birthday is in that calendar knows what it means about their personality and the kind of jobs that
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.440]   they're supposed to do each one of those days has their own spirit and what's supposed to happen in
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:24.480]   those days the maya collectively call them the mom the grandmother grandfather spirits and and and they talk
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.440]   to each one of those days and they pray to them they have there's now an association of some
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:36.560]   eight thousand people that are called aki that are day keepers who are keeping the days
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:43.520]   and they're also like community uh psychologists almost people come to them and say you know
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:49.840]   my life is mixed up what's wrong here well let's ask the mom like okay well it looks like you're not
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:54.240]   doing this or that or you know what you're an accountant you're not supposed to be an accountant you're
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:59.040]   supposed to be a you know a a midwife what are you doing you're you're living your life wrong you're
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.640]   you're you're a keeb you need to start being a keeb so they take extremely seriously the day on which
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:11.680]   you're born what that means like the the spirit that embodies that day right like i'm i'm keeb i'm 13
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:18.720]   keeb and it says my it's funny how accurate a lot of them are mine is basically is uh i'm uh i'm an
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:26.880]   irresponsible husband and parent but people like me so my family still prospers like oh god that's
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:32.240]   that's horribly that's horribly accurate i mean it's some of it is also the chicken or the egg if you
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.880]   truly believe so if you've structured society where this calendar is truly sacred then it kind of like
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:45.440]   you manifest a lot of the the spirit does manifest itself in the life of the people that
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:51.200]   are born on that spirit's day absolutely it's interesting and then and the maya really feel
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:58.080]   this in this system so that's the core system this 260 day calendar was the very first calendar they made
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.680]   thousands of years ago and it's the one that's most important today uh why 260 days by the way
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:11.920]   is there a reasoning behind it from most maya agree with this today and you know who knows what the
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:19.280]   original architects thousands of years ago were thinking but it's nine months it's the human
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:26.240]   gestation period so if you if you conceived on the day 13 monkey chances are your kids coming out
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:35.120]   on or near 13 monkey and uh i think it's beautiful i mean if if that's right that means the maya and the
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:42.160]   people of mesoamerica will all share it together um when they thought about we need we need a count of
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.400]   time that's for us they didn't look up into the heavens they looked like into their bodies what's the
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:56.000]   first cycle that we actually go through as humans and they picked this nine month thing it's it really is
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:03.120]   our cycle and no other culture on the planet looked inside themselves to create their calendar like that
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:10.480]   uh so that's the oldest one and the sacred one that still carries through to today uh what's the second
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:16.480]   one of the hub the hub is the solar calendar the one that everybody on the planet eventually comes up
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.320]   with we know it's second though because when they start talking about it they use all the symbols and
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:28.880]   the numbers from the 261. they say well we need a solar one too let's just keep counting this another
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:37.600]   105 days and we'll get to 365. oh interesting they kind of carry the same uh got it got it got it and
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:44.000]   that's useful because for all the sort of agriculture all those kind of reasons right though interestingly
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.480]   they never put a leap year in the hub is also called the vague year because it's just 365 which means
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.680]   every year they're off a quarter of a day and eventually it starts really adding up yeah in
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:06.320]   fact it's even caused modern modern problems in this calendar here i just do the straight math from
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:16.320]   a thousand years ago and so i place the beginning of the solar year differently than some maya groups do
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.920]   especially the guys in the highlands of eastern guatemala they write me nasty emails saying i don't
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.240]   know what time the year is but their relatives changed it in the 1950s because their agricultural
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:37.760]   cycle was so far off they moved it 60 days back to make it in the spring again but it drifts which is
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.600]   strange because it's not a very good thing for the the agricultural cycle it's one of these mysteries
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.360]   we still don't have an explanation for uh so that's the hub and then what's the long count the long
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:56.320]   counts they're really mysterious cool one because it's a linear count of days which are not like them
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:00.800]   it's it's a bunch of cycles like ours you know our weeks are a cycle our months are a cycle
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:11.520]   um but it's weird in that its estimation of the year in the in the long count system is only 360 days
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:21.680]   so it's miserably off uh a solar year and they count in base 20 so they count like we count in tens
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:30.080]   we're decimal they count in base 20 but decimal and so it should be you know there's ones there's 20s
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.440]   there's four hundreds there's eight thousands there's a hundred and sixty thousands it's up it goes
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:45.840]   just like our tens hundreds thousands ten thousands but it's times 20. so that third so they have days
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:54.640]   months of 20 days and then they have these years that are should be by their math 400 but it's only 360
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:00.240]   and that throws the whole thing out of whack going further up then they have a 20-year period and a 400
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:08.320]   year period 400 years to their calendar but it's only by that time it's only 396 years in our period
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:17.840]   in our reckoning so it's it's mysterious that it's why did they tweak it at the year to be only 360 days
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.720]   that's you know that doesn't follow any astronomy that doesn't that's not the human cycle
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:28.880]   yeah but they're i mean it's interesting that they build up towards thinking about very long
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:39.840]   periods of time like buck tunes is 144 000 days right or uh about tune is 400 of the long counts years
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.920]   so it's kind of like our millennium you know we we think it's a big deal when we hit a millennium
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:53.280]   or uh or or a century that's a they have a 20-year period that they do a lot of celebrations on called
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.920]   a cartoon and then they have the 400 bach tune which is the big one that's like their millennium
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:09.360]   and 13 of those bach tunes uh occurred in the creation before us they also think that we're in
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.320]   that the world has had multiple creations they're not alone in that there's lots of ancient civilizations
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:21.600]   who say that but we're technically in the fourth creation and they're they have a creation story
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:30.720]   called the popel vu and the popel vu is clear as day that the third creation ends with the help of
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:38.560]   these heroes called the hero twins and the fourth creation begins and so on the maya monuments we see
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.680]   them doing the math through the long count and we can calculate it back very exactly it happened
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:56.160]   the fourth creation started on august 11th 3114 bc and it says it doesn't say it's day one it says it's the
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:06.960]   last day of the 13th bach tune of the third creation which leads us to believe that a creation is only 13
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:13.520]   bach tunes long right so and this would be the fourth creation the calendar starts fourth creation
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:24.160]   but if you do the math going from 3 114 bc and count 13 bach tunes forward you get to 2012
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:32.800]   and hence the uh the very popular notion that 2012 whenever that was december something december
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:40.240]   21st 2012 will be the end of the world right so can you explain this those were very fruitful years for me i
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:46.720]   had so many lectures around the country that was that's like uh like garrett morris in saturday night
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.800]   live the the the the apocalypse was very very good to me
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:57.840]   uh i mean but that that is pretty interesting so that's that that would be so technically being that
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:04.720]   what in the fifth no yeah technically we'd be in the fifth though my argument was that actually
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:11.680]   if you look through all the corpus of maya mathematics and calendars they never say anything
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:20.080]   like that in fact there's a handful of dates that tell us uh that that the fourth creation does continue
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:30.720]   farther on that that bach tune place should have 20 20 bach tunes in it like their counting system would
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:38.640]   dictate not 13. and there's there's a place in uh in palenque there's a place in the dresden codex
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:45.680]   and one other place i'm forgetting that uh that all talk about time after 2012.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:51.680]   so how does that happen it's a conflict is there supposed to be an overlap of the
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.560]   of the of the of uh the third so it's like 13 is the core of it and it's 20 long they they love the
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:06.880]   number 13 it's all over the place it's a magic number to them my explanation which i admit is is not
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:16.720]   very solid but uh i think that the magical deeds of the hero twins in their creation story at the end of
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:26.000]   the third uh the third uh the third creation hit the magical reset button and that it just restarted
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.800]   time right there because of their magic but that was not to say that the natural bach tune cycle should
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:42.960]   be 13. and there are certain texts that uh that go way forward in time or way backward in time and
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:48.400]   whenever they want to do that there there are higher increments than just the bach tune above that
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:54.400]   there's the pick tune then there's the kalaba tune then there's alawa tune and it goes on and on and
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:01.920]   these are like you know 160 000 years huge increments of time whenever they want to do that and they talk
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.080]   about a long period of time they start putting 13s in all of those increments those higher increments
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:14.000]   and i think what they're saying is uh they're making an esoteric statement about the never-ending
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:21.360]   nature of time that's that's what i think there's they're telling us in those texts that time goes on
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:28.480]   forever magically but there they still had a conception that it didn't go on forever before
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.800]   right that there was other civilizations that came before in there and there this is the fourth creation
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.760]   this is the fourth creation and the gods made everybody the the first ones were made of mud and
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:47.440]   they melted the second ones were made of sticks but they were jerks to the animals um the the third ones
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:58.560]   were like us but uh but flawed and in some other way and then we're finally made of uh of the blood of the
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:05.680]   gods and corn we're made out of corn so we're we're perfect and as the as it explains to us
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:13.760]   the the the popol vu does we got it right this time there there is there there's no reason to believe
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:22.720]   that this creation has a set duration well one of the weird things is that the aztecs who we talk to a lot at
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:28.880]   the other people who have had contact they also had the concept of multiple creations before us but
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:36.800]   they were real clear to the spanish that they weren't all the same time element uh some of them were in
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:43.440]   the 300s of years some of them were in the 700s of years but they were not the same time period so
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.960]   our our mathematical logic that if the third creation was 13 this one must be third creation
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:58.960]   is in or also be 13 it's in direct opposition to what the aztecs told us about the nature of creations
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:04.640]   they're different time periods why do you think there was the myth of the previous creations did they
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:15.440]   have some kind of long multi-generational memory of prior civilizations it may have had some echo in the
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:22.000]   uh the flood myths right it's the same it's the same kind of major myths carried through long periods of
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:28.320]   time there's a lot of different opinions about it and you know they're like if they were all 13
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:36.880]   if we have five creations like the aztecs said and they were all 13 they would come up to roughly 25
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:42.240]   000 something years which is very close to that processional cycle so some people are like they
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:49.440]   designed it all to be one completion of the procession of the equinoxes and i mean that the
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:54.240]   that i don't believe that one but that one sure sounds good doesn't it that's that's going to get a lot
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:04.400]   of internet hits and one of the things i do obviously uh wonder about is um why the flood
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:12.800]   myth is part of like most societies and most religions i think that one's pretty easy it's the end of the
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:21.920]   ice age when the bathtub filled back up huh so it's just the ice age it's just it's the seas filling back up
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:31.360]   and they without really understanding what happened they just carried that story everybody knows that
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:37.120]   everybody's nice coastal village went underwater yeah and they had to they had to seek higher ground
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:41.600]   and then just like people like talking about the weather everybody was talking about the weather
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:48.240]   for many generations as the sea level was going up and then uh that that myth carried why do we live
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:55.440]   here grandpa well we used to live over there but then the water came and then many grandpas later
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:02.240]   is just kind of permeates every idea it becomes mythology but global mythology so that one you
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:07.360]   know there's a lot of things i don't have a reasonable explanation for but the uh but the flood myth
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:15.520]   is almost certainly is almost certainly the the rise in sea level so the this idea that every day represents
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:23.920]   uh that carries a spirit uh you know there's modern day astrology you know most people kind of consider
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:35.120]   astrology this um maybe a bit unscientific woo-woo type of um uh set of beliefs but do you think there's some wisdom that astrology carries
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:42.480]   from your scholarship of the maya calendar do you think if we carry that to the
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.480]   astrological perspective on the world do you think there's some wisdom there
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:56.160]   i don't know you know that i i have a woo-woo part of me i i i would like to believe that stuff but i don't
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:06.080]   think as a scientist it makes a i cannot come up with a biological scientific reason why that would be
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:16.320]   true and you know when you look at it objectively i mean really is everybody born with the sign scorpio
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:26.560]   a a moody person that's just uh that's just objectively not true um but it is funny how oftentimes these
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:34.960]   these maya uh horoscopes for lack of a better word do hit the mark there was some student who surveyed like
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:41.120]   three hundred people with the app i made and asked them about their greek sign and their maya sign and
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:47.920]   his conclusion for his term paper was that the maya one was working way better which that's that's
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:53.760]   fascinating at least that's that's fun but no i'm i think i'm too much of a scientist to believe
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:00.480]   that i i just don't have a a any foundation in science that would allow us to believe that the uh
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:08.240]   the month in which we were born in a cycle sets our personality and destiny
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:18.480]   i agree and yet there's so much mystery all around us that uh what i do like is the uh inbuilt humility
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:26.320]   to that world view um that there's this whole you can call it a spiritual world but a world that we don't
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:33.280]   under quite understand and then you can wonder about what is the wisdom that that world carries
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:39.360]   and then you construct all kinds of systems to try to interpret that and then there is where the human
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:46.960]   hubris can come in and you know uh but it's good to be humbled by how little we know i suppose i do love
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.880]   the mysteries of the world and i i i would i would love to find an ancient civilization but i don't
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:58.160]   i i don't want to solve the mysteries of the world i think they're one of the things that make world
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:06.640]   life worth living that's true that's true um you mentioned the uh maya writing system what are some
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.560]   interesting aspects of their language that they've used in the written language that they used well you know
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:18.560]   one of the things that confound me as a guy who's spent you know better portion of my life studying
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:25.040]   it i had the honor of being uh the student of uh linda shealy right here at the university of texas at
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:32.560]   austin she got the group together who broke the maya code of hieroglyphics in the 1970s so i learned
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.160]   from the best and and loved every minute of it i miss linda can you speak to that code actually the
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:44.800]   hieroglyphic code and what it takes to break it oh boy i mean what a what a thing we we had kind of a
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:54.640]   a rosetta stone we had a page out of diego delanda's book a priest who was converting the maya in yucatan
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:03.120]   asked his informants about their writing system and what every sound meant and he was convinced they had a
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:09.920]   alphabet like we do so he got this maya guy sat down in spanish and he said okay you're gonna write
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:16.480]   all the symbols right here in my book right write an ah here write a bay here write a say here and that
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:24.240]   guy just wrote all of the sounds that the priest told him to write they were actually syllables they were
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:33.040]   vowel consonant combinations they weren't an alphabet but that turned into our rosetta stone of sorts
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.800]   the big key is that the maya still speak that same language there are millions of maya people who are
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:48.560]   speaking a version of maya now there's there's where i get confused that we've got a single writing
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:54.880]   system that is intelligible we've broken the code so we know that it's basically the same writing
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:04.800]   system from the top of the yucatan into guatemala and el salvador but we have 33 maya languages today
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:12.160]   that are mutually unintelligible and we we backwards project the language of what they spoke back then that
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:18.000]   the glyphs are in to something called chole tea which is a combination of chor tea and chole two of those
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:25.760]   languages but it doesn't work for me at all how did if there was one language maybe two back then
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:37.200]   how did it flower into 33 mutually unintelligible languages in just 500 years during uh culture acculturation
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:43.680]   and horrible infectious diseases that killed 90 percent of the population how did that happen
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:51.840]   so we're missing something huge here i think it's more like chinese where chinese letters uh uh writing
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:58.800]   can be read in multiple languages and still understood i don't know exactly the mechanics of how that would
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:05.920]   happen but it just seems impossible that there are more languages not less languages in the maya
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.520]   area after the last 500 years that they've been through so you think that there's some kind of
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:17.920]   process of either rapidly generating dialects or there always has been these dialects or i should say
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:24.400]   they're distinct languages even though there's a common writing system there must have been a way that
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:32.800]   multiple languages understood the same writing system or maybe there was something like like latin you know how
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:40.480]   there was a period in europe where like most people were illiterate and there was this this priesthood
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:48.080]   who all understood latin and they wrote in latin yeah maybe the the hieroglyphs represent a kind of
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:55.360]   latin in the ancient maya world but we don't really know and there's not clear evidence to fill in the gaps of
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:02.480]   how it's possible to have that right but we did realize it was actually a russian scholar named yuri
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:11.280]   konorozov who broke the code the americans and the europeans were absolutely sure that the language was
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:18.640]   uh that the written language was a dead language but yuri not knowing any of that not being filled with all of
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:26.960]   those thoughts from america and europe went about it in the way that he was taught uh in his in his grad
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:34.320]   school in moscow and just went to the dictionaries and he looked at yukatek language that they're speaking
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:41.680]   today and he applied it to the symbol system and he knew that there were certain sounds he used landa's
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:49.760]   alphabet and he found there was the his two key examples were a picture of a dog with a symbol over
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:59.600]   it and a picture of a turkey with a symbol over it and the dog uh a dog in yukatek is so he saw
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:06.000]   two symbols and he said this one's probably sue and this one's all and then the turkey was coots
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:13.040]   so it would be coo ending in sue and he showed how look you know this is suits this is soul
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:19.920]   those two things that that should be tsu are the same symbol and that began this process of
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:27.200]   unraveling the syllables that we're still working on today that's fascinating just that decoding process
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:32.560]   is fascinating like how do you even figure that out and there's probably still is there still are you
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:39.440]   aware of any um written languages that haven't been decoded yet yeah yeah there's a number of them
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:46.720]   there's uh easter island script i was just talking to uh we've apparently made a few advances there now
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:54.720]   it's called rongo rongo and we only have about maybe 25 examples of texts but we're beginning to break that
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:03.040]   there's also the the the big one is harapan harapan for a long time we used to say there were there were
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:14.400]   five independent scripts on the planet and those were chinese cuneiform which is mesopotamian egyptian
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:24.640]   maya and then harapan which is from northern india that's the only one that we've never cracked and now all the
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:31.200]   epigraphers the people that's the term for epigraphy is uh translating these languages they're all
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:36.480]   ganging up on harapan and want to kick it off the list because we can't break it it had a big enough
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:42.320]   symbol set but no one's been able to crack it and now they're saying it's just an elaborate symbol set
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:49.760]   and doesn't reflect the the spoken word that's uh that's a hypothesis but it's which is what would
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:54.480]   explain why it's so different right right but you know we could just be faced with a quitter generation
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:56:00.080]   maybe somebody will pick up the baton next generation these days with their the other one that fascinates
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:07.680]   me is from the americas it's the quipu the the inca had the quipu this knotted string records but it was
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:15.920]   definitely encoding more than just math we know the math i know lots i can do the math quipus and figure out
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:20.640]   what they're totaling and things yeah there's a quipu right there who are recording devices
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:25.760]   fashioned from strings historically used by a number of cultures in the region of andean south america
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.480]   a quipu usually consists of cotton or cabinet fiber string so there's a set of strings and they're
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.680]   supposed to what to be saying something there's one long string that the little ones dangle off of
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:42.960]   and each one of the the dangling strings have sets of knots on them and the knots some of them are
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.600]   mathematical keepus and those we can just do the math we can prove that it's math
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.800]   um they also encoded language in there they had entire libraries in cusco where
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:01.120]   spanish conquistadors were brought through and the caretakers of the libraries would just put
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:05.280]   they'd say uh pull that one down read that one to me and he'd pull it out and just read
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:11.920]   a history of something that happened 200 years earlier so it was definitely writing but in the
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:21.040]   1570s one uh one head of the church there had all of the people that could read them called kipu kamax
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:29.200]   gathered up had them read all of their kippus and transcribe them into spanish books and then had the
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:35.520]   kippus burned and those people murdered okay well there you go and so we can't break the code still
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:44.240]   today but we know it was absolutely a written language though it wasn't written it was weaved or knotted
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:51.360]   and there's still some keepers available that could be there's i think now we've just crossed the 1000 mark
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:59.840]   so we have a thousand kippus there's enough to break the code um and and i think this generation
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:06.720]   might be the one that does it it's sad that so fewer have survived yeah i mean a thousand is good but
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:14.400]   it's but see there's peru has barely scratched the surface with archaeology there's so much out there
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:22.080]   there's there was a priest i read about named diego de porres who was one of the early people in peru
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:28.960]   converting communities and his chronicle is real clear that he wanted to teach this community of
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:34.800]   three thousand people all the spanish prayers the important ones for them to be converted into
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:44.720]   christianity and he had the the community's kipu kamax not kippus for each person that told them that
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:50.240]   they could read them out and memorize the prayers and if they were caught without their kipu in town they
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:58.480]   were flogged so he had 3 000 of the same kipu made and handed out to this community if we find that
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:07.040]   community and find its cemetery there is a rosetta stone you know it is probably the case there is
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:13.760]   somebody in peru and maybe a large community that knows this language that understands and like you
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.960]   just have to show up and ask them and that's it's like they're like oh yeah yeah they there there are some
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:23.440]   communities that are using them there's a couple of them that we had high hopes for and then it was
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:29.760]   apparent that they were just making up they didn't actually know how to read it they just knew it used
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:33.840]   to be read so they like made a bunch of stuff about what it says and they bring it out and they act like
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:38.400]   they can read it but then when you ask them the details they don't know yeah but then on a much
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:45.920]   simpler level there's uh llama herders who keep a string in their pocket and they've they've got uh
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:51.280]   the knots equaling how many llamas they have and then they have subcategories of information like this
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:58.720]   one's sick uh we've lost these ones this one's pregnant so they have these more simple and more
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:06.400]   mathematical kipus but they're using them to affect as a as a record is it possible through archaeology
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:16.240]   to know what you know the social organization of the maya was like what uh maybe if there was a hierarchy
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:23.040]   maybe what the political structure was if there was a leader of different roles you know priests or
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:28.080]   like who had the power who was powerless who had certain kinds of roles is it possible to know that
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:33.040]   actually because of hieroglyphs yeah we know a whole lot there's you know basic things that archaeology
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.680]   which is a very blunt tool can figure out like this guy lives in a rich house this guy lives in a poor
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:46.640]   house but um the hieroglyphs tell us specific stuff about uh who can rule that it was hereditary
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:56.000]   that uh that hereditary rule was based on royal blood that could be burned and connect to the
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.760]   ancestors that lived up in the sky versus the one that's lived in the underworld it also told us things
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:10.080]   about hierarchy like that there were councils of lords underneath the king who each represented clans
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:18.400]   who had their own neighborhoods and that there were revolving positions of uh authority there was uh the
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:26.000]   the site that i mapped for my dissertation and spent years in the jungle there uh palenque had a lord's
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:34.560]   title named fire lord that was one of the like generals of their army and we could tell that position
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:43.760]   changed over time so there was one guy named chock suits who was the fire lord uh for the early part
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:49.840]   of a reign of a king called the kalmonab and then by the time he carves this other panel there's another
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:58.800]   guy in the position of kak ahal which was the fire lord and so he had got promoted it was uh well he
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:05.440]   could have been killed i mean the case of that but then we have the interesting case of uh in the post
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:11.920]   classic they shed the idea of kings they don't like kings anymore that's probably a big part of why the
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:17.840]   classic disappearance and the abandonment of all those cities happened people just got sick of kings
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:25.280]   and so they turned into this more council system at chichen itza but then when chichen itza falls
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:31.680]   there's a new city that's uh that's architecture looks a lot like chichen itza it's called mayapon
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:41.840]   but it has uh what is called the league of mayapon and it has a council of representatives from the
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:49.440]   communities from all around the yucatan and it is basically a democracy it's a it is a maya democracy
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:56.400]   that happens the individuals from all around the yucatan are there they each each family has their own
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:02.080]   council house at mayapon though they live back at their place it's kind of like a maya congress
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:10.560]   representative democracy it it really was i mean and this happens in uh i guess 1250
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:18.640]   a.d that this this maya democracy happens and we know the names of them we know the families and of
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:25.120]   course they were humans so eventually they screwed it all up one family murdered another family and the
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.800]   whole the whole city burned yeah and of course it's probably some fascinating corruption which is hard
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:36.080]   to discover through uh part of it was the aztecs screwing things up the aztecs came down with all
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:41.760]   sorts of like we'll buy everything you're making and then eventually they were like could we maybe buy some
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.880]   humans yeah and then one family was like no and the other family was like i don't know they're making
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.880]   us a lot of money so then you know they they murdered each other and the water supply got
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:04:00.240]   polluted and then the city burned it seems like slavery murder and disease is a large component
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:08.320]   of the story of humans um you mentioned different periods in the maya the classic the post classic
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:13.040]   the pre-classic the archaic can you just speak to that so archaic is before there was really a
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.160]   civilization that was uh archaic is pretty much when everybody's hunter gatherers so the classic
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:24.320]   period was the golden age and then the pre-classic is the interesting time that we were talking about
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:31.360]   and the post-classic is when the democracy came about well midway through it yeah reverted back to
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:38.720]   council systems the maya loved to be part of councils so yeah we have pre-classic is like the origins
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:44.240]   of civilization they're starting to build cities they're starting to create their calendar they're
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:52.000]   starting to create these wonderful works of art and the classic period if you look at at 10 different
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.680]   textbooks for the maya you'll get 10 different dates that wiggle around in there but basically
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:03.360]   that's the that's the age of kings to me that's when these cities decide that they're going to organize
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:10.880]   themselves around uh elite royal families that have this magical blood that can contact their ancestors
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:18.080]   that are directly in contact with the gods the maya never contact their gods directly they contact
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:25.680]   their ancestors who are up there who act like liaisons to the gods and so the maya age of kings has these
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:32.400]   dynasties sprouting up where these people have you know basically snowed the rest of the people that
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:39.760]   they've got a special quality of their blood and only their offspring can do the same trick and talk
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:47.600]   to the gods where everybody every joe maya can let their blood and burn it and contact their ancestor
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:54.160]   but joe maya's dad is just a corn farmer who lives down below and he's got no influence over the gods
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:02.560]   but the rulers their their spirits go down briefly but then they go up into the heavens and reside
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:09.200]   where the gods are and can act as liaisons so that's the validation for this kingship that happens
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:18.800]   for about 400 years i know we we say 250 to 900 which is kind of the the encompassing edges of it but it's
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:27.760]   interesting that it's actually specifically the ninth bach tune of their history the ninth bach tune begins
[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:39.120]   in like 4 26 and it ends in like 8 29 so it's a 400 year period of time and before that there were no kings
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:43.520]   and after that there really aren't kings they're heads of councils
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:49.120]   so it's i i call it the age of kings where everybody's following the directives of
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:57.920]   basically a despot and for a while that's great i mean cities build up populations happening uh that's
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:04.480]   it's i i see it as kind of a cult of personality moment too strong charismatic leaders inspire people
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:10.720]   to do great things together but eventually like happens all the time with power too much power
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:18.960]   corrupts all of a sudden there's this unwieldy huge elite class that has to be treated special by
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:24.240]   everybody else and uh and they start saying well i think we should fight with those guys and you guys
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:30.160]   should go take these things and people eventually get sick of it and they walk away from these cities
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:36.320]   and that's how we get the mysterious maya collapse where all these cities are just gone that's one of the
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:42.480]   great mysteries of uh the maya civilization is that over a very short period of time what like 100 years
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:49.040]   it seems to have declined very rapidly it collapsed what do you think explains that what happened
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:58.400]   i think it's a failing of archaeology to properly see what was happening i think that most of those cities
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:06.720]   populations moved you know no more than 20 to 40 kilometers out and started their own farm and
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:12.720]   they lived in perishable houses and all archaeology signature sees is that nobody lives in the city
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:19.040]   center anymore we don't see a bunch of mass bodies there was no there's no evidence of people getting
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:26.000]   sick there are certain cities that fought with each other at the end and we see that signature plain as day
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:33.040]   we see we know when a city was attacked and burned mostly that didn't happen people moved and migrated
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:41.440]   and it seems like right there around like between 800 and 900 a lot of the elites that were on top
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:49.040]   in the most of it was in the rainforests of northern guatemala they move they move in two
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:55.600]   directions some of them move into the highlands of guatemala and some of them move up into the yucatan
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:05.680]   of the city of chichen itza becomes the next big capital in yucatan but the word itza is actually
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:14.880]   a word describing the people who lived around lake p10 itza in northern guatemala and all of the maya are
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:23.120]   super clear about that that the itza came in as immigrants with these new ideas and created chichen itza so
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:30.240]   the the elites who were no longer welcome in their cities just moved and set up shop somewhere else
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:36.480]   so why was there a decline what was maybe the catalyst was there specific kind of events that
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:42.640]   started this was this an idea that kind of transformed the society we are still debating that we i don't
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.480]   think there is a single reason i think humans are complicated i think a lot of things led to this
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:56.800]   one thing we can see archaeologically is that every one of the cities became overpopulated they were
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:03.680]   too popular and we think that they pushed the limits of their capacity to feed and house people
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:11.440]   we see it in lots of the cities at the end of the classic period that people are seasonally starving
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:20.960]   i remember uh really stark evidence in copan honduras copan was this beautiful city lineage of 17 kings
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:26.480]   but the last kings and the last elite burials that we dig from the city center
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:33.760]   the teeth are the telling part they get this thing when you when you're growing up and you're not getting
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:41.200]   enough food seasonally it shows up in the enamel of your teeth that's called a dental hypoplasia
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:49.840]   and if somebody's seasonally starving it gets these lines in their teeth and that last generation of maya
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:57.840]   before they left copan even the rich people are seasonally starving so there's a problem there for sure
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:05.760]   but i also think it's a it's a weird thing it was not an empire it was a group of independent city
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:12.720]   states like greece some of them were allied some of them were enemies there was a huge civil war that
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.960]   settled out about the end of the classic period so if it was europe you know the victors would have
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.440]   taken over the losers would have beat it and gone wherever they went but when they abandoned these cities
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:31.120]   that were independent still they all left both the guys that won and the guys that lost the war so it
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:38.640]   couldn't be just as simple as spoils go to the victor um it's such a wide area not everybody was
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:46.640]   starving like the people in the copan valley so i i personally think it was calendrically timed it is
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:54.160]   interesting to note that that ninth period that ninth 400 year period ends right then and i think a lot of
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:59.920]   people you know i can't prove it archaeologically but i think a lot of people said we're coming to the
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:07.200]   end of a great cycle and we need to renew we need to change what we're doing when you talk to the maya
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:13.680]   today like at the end of this uh 2012 thing if you actually talk to maya say you know what happens at
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:23.280]   the end of a big cycle here they say cycles are a time of renewal and transformation that it is all of our
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.200]   obligation to change our lives at the end of cycles that change is coming we can either be
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:36.160]   part of it or we can get steamrolled by it the aztecs did this neat thing called the new fire ceremony
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:43.360]   every 52 years which was the biggest their calendar would go they'd burn down perfectly good temples
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:52.880]   and they'd burn down their houses sometimes and they would just everybody in in society would perform this what they call the new fire
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:13:00.160]   ceremony and they would renew the world so i think my personal theory is that the maya
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:06.400]   decided at the end of the ninth bach tune that it was time to renew the world i think this theory makes
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.960]   sense because they really internalized the calendar i mean it was a really big part of their culture
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:20.400]   the sense of the cyclical nature of civilization that's what i think i think that uh that they created that
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:28.480]   calendar to perceive the cycle and to harmonize with it yeah uh you mentioned aztec what was the origin of
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:37.200]   the aztec where did these where do these people come from at what time and how you know almost every
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:42.480]   one of the cultures we're talking about now we have two different versions of the answer to that question
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:50.800]   we have the archaeology version and we have the aztecs themselves the aztecs have this wonderful
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:14:00.080]   migration story where they say that they came from a place well to the north called aslan and that they
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:06.880]   had this migration that went through kind of a hero's journey where they go to this snake mountain place
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:14.560]   and they encounter uh the birth of the war god that they'll worship after this and how they stepped
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:23.920]   into the valley of mexico as the last the lost brothers of everyone in the valley of mexico they said that they
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:34.640]   all came from the north near aslan is a place a cave with seven different passages called uh chiqui mostac and that
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:41.440]   all the people who spoke the language nahuatl came from the cave and most of them went early to the valley
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:49.440]   of mexico and in the aztecs uh story they were just the lost tribe they were the last brothers to come in
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:58.080]   and but then they show up late game and they become mercenaries they just start working for
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.000]   communities in the valley of mexico and this takes place
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:11.440]   in the 1300s so about 200 years before cortez shows up the aztecs show up to the valley of mexico
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:18.400]   and they make themselves this uh indispensable group of mercenaries they do the dirty work
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:26.880]   the all the all the all the civilized uh communities around lake texcoco which is in the middle of the
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:33.680]   which is now mexico city it's all dried up but uh those guys were too civilized to fight with each other
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.880]   but they could hire the aztecs to do their dirty stuff so the aztecs did that and really changed the
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:47.360]   politics in the game of the valley of mexico the dirty stuff does the load of the muscle yeah they'd go in and
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:53.280]   and they they'd kill whoever you wanted killed and now you're the king of this area so one of these
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:59.280]   kings that they were working for really liked them and decided i'm gonna make the aztecs part of our
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:06.560]   ancestry i'm gonna give them my daughter to marry the head of the aztecs
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:15.040]   and the aztecs sacrificed her and that really pissed that guy off so he took like his whole
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:21.200]   army and ran the aztecs out for a while they say they live in this horrible desert section eating
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:28.240]   lizards but then one of their priests say we're gonna walk around the lake and my visions say that
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:36.480]   where we see an eagle sitting on a cactus with a snake in its mouth is where we will build our capital
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:44.080]   and they see that but it's out on an island in the lake and they he said well i don't know that's
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:52.400]   that's the place so they build up an island they go to that island and then they just start piling up lake
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:58.720]   muck until they make a whole city there in the middle of the island they make or the lake they
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:05.440]   make an island city and all of this occurs in about a hundred years so they show up about 1300
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:14.560]   the capital of tenochtitlan as they called it uh is really established and from there they quickly
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:22.000]   take over the entire valley they make uh what they call the triple alliance which is the two other big
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.680]   communities of the lake are now their allies but they're not really allies the the aztecs were brutal
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:31.680]   they were just those guys agreed to shut up and let the aztecs run the show
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.880]   and then the aztecs spread like a wildfire all the way down into the maya area everywhere they go they
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:47.120]   rename everybody's towns and make them pay tribute pretty short lasting civilization uh spread extremely
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:54.400]   quickly uh famous what what what are some defining qualities that explain that i think they were very
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:02.080]   much like they they had an attitude like attila the hun they just had no problem ripping your skin off
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:10.400]   everybody else had become too comfortable and too civilized and the aztecs were just mercenary they
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:17.280]   told everybody you know we can either rip your heart out or you can work for us and if you work for us you'll
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:22.720]   be just fine they'd go to every town they'd go to the first thing they do is they'd show up with a bunch of uh
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:30.080]   merchants there was a merchant class who were also military they were really the the the people who assessed
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:36.080]   where they were going to attack next they'd go in with a bunch of aztec products and say we'd like to trade
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:43.200]   with you but all the time they were assessing their military prowess what uh what products they had that
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:50.400]   they could take and then soon after the pocheteca were there would come the military with the reconnaissance
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:57.200]   so the the aztec had a huge warrior class as you're saying so what was there just can you
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:07.040]   uh linger on their whole relationship with war and violence they they worshipped a war deity their main
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:15.920]   temple was uh the templo mayor it had two temples up on top one was to tlaloc the rain god who liked a lot of
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:23.920]   sacrifice himself but then the other one was we seal up poshli he was that translates the hummingbird on
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:29.680]   the left but he's the war god i love that he's a hummingbird maybe you know he's fast and he comes
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:37.600]   from the magical side or something but uh then then right next to the temple on either side were the two
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:43.440]   temples of the warriors one was the eagle warrior clan the other one was the jaguar warrior clan
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:50.480]   and they they were symbolically in competition with each other though a unified force i guess you know
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:57.360]   probably an analogy between like the navy and the air force you know they had a good natured competition
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:04.640]   of who was better but they were the same force so those were their symbolic warriors dressed up in all
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:13.200]   of their finery and they would they they would come at people uh with these two forces and it was very unlike
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:19.760]   uh anything that had happened before in mesoamerica again i think i could draw a parallel to what
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:28.800]   happened in europe you know the famous uh henry v moment in agincourt where you know his kind of uh
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:38.880]   ragtag army wipes out half of france's aristocracy with the longbow like up until that moment europe had a very
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:46.640]   uh wars for the elite classes kind of attitude and then after france lost half their aristocracy then
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:53.440]   i was like maybe we should be hiring from the villages the same sort of thing happened with the aztec that
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:21:02.560]   there was a mesoamerica really didn't have huge standing armies but the aztec put this army together and they
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:08.240]   intimidated people they didn't actually have to use it a lot it was very it was used to great effect
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:13.760]   in the in the valley of mexico and for the rest of mesoamerica it was mostly the fear factor
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:22.480]   but there also seemed to be um you know a celebration of uh of violence i think you said
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:30.160]   uh that beauty and blood went hand in hand for the aztec maybe like the roman empire was it they just
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:37.840]   had maybe a different relationship with what violence where that stood in uh the purpose of life
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:45.040]   purpose of existence is that fair to say i would hypothesize so i mean that you know i think it's one
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:51.120]   of the wonderful things about studying these ancient cultures you know knowing what our human capacity is
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:59.040]   and the aztecs uh when i when i said that statement i what i what i meant by that is they were absolutely
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:05.360]   comfortable with human sacrifice and you know ripping people's hearts out this they had this this just
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:17.360]   you know grotesque violent bent but in the same way they also absolutely loved flower gardens and poetry and
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:28.160]   music and dance the same aztec king who would order the hearts of a thousand people extracted also would stand
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:35.600]   up at dinner parties to recite his own poetry or the poetry of famous statesmen that had come before
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:44.000]   him and they spent money on things like flower gardens they're all of the causeways leading to the aztec
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:53.680]   capital had beautiful flower gardens and they had a museum and they had an aquarium and a zoo and they had an
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:23:02.400]   opera and they had a ballet yeah and and these things existed together there was not in the aztec mind
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:10.800]   any conflict between witnessing someone's heart getting ripped out one moment in the evening we'd go to the
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:16.880]   ballet um how does that contrast the relationship with war and violence with the with the other
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:23.440]   civilizations of mesoamerica and south america maybe the maya what was their relationship like with war
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:30.080]   the maya were certainly influenced by the aztec at the end so we get a we get a skewed perspective from
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:39.120]   the contact period accounts because the maya were much more violent and sacrifice oriented in their
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:47.440]   post-classic rendition but in the classic period it was mostly the priests and the king who were doing
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:57.040]   the sacrificing of themselves that we know that the maya kings would cut their penises and then bleed that
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:05.760]   blood onto paper and uh the paper would burn and become the smoke through which they'd they'd uh commune
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:13.200]   with their ancestors but they'd actually tie this paper onto their penis cut it and then dance so the
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:20.000]   blood splattered but it was them cutting themselves it was different than killing a bunch of other people
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.560]   for it it was a auto sacrifice we call it still very macabre but very different than deciding a whole bunch
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:32.720]   of other people should die it was a self-sacrifice thing can you speak to sacrifice a bit more animal
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:38.720]   sacrifice human sacrifice what what role did that play in in um for the maya for the aztec for the different
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:46.000]   cultures here was that religious in nature it was absolutely religious in nature and the aztecs were of the
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:55.680]   opinion that uh that the war god demanded people were captured and sacrificed and it had to be valuable
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:03.360]   people there was a lot of uh before they made that big standing army they had just ritual battles that
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:10.640]   they would have and they'd take captives uh in fact all around mesoamerica they wanted captives so that
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:18.400]   they could bring them back and sacrifice them for the gods and the aztecs deciding to specifically
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:24.400]   follow the war god did this more than anybody they did it so much and so successfully that they didn't
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:32.880]   have any enemy enemies nearby so they decided this one poor sucker group uh not that far away called the
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:41.440]   talash collins that they were never going to uh make peace with them so that they could go close by every
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:49.200]   year and just have a little symbolic war with the talash collins and haul them back for sacrifice cortez met
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:56.720]   those guys and he was like here are people who hate their guts i'll just use these guys so you know we say
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:03.520]   oh cortez took over the aztec world it was it was cortez and 20 000 super pissed off talash collins
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:10.080]   and the actual sacrifice what so there would be kind of these ritual battles or is it chopping off
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:16.240]   people's heads and uh like is there is there some interesting rituals around the sacrifice it's mostly
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:21.920]   hard extraction sometimes heads but they bring them up on top of the temple so everybody can see it and they
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:28.080]   they had a specific stone where they would bend them over so their rib cage would come out and
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:35.520]   they they'd use uh like a thick obsidian knife and they had a really just uh like tried and true way to
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:41.840]   do it they'd stab it in in a certain place close and then they'd push down on the sternum as they ripped
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:47.280]   up on the rib cage and they just so they just make a place where they could just rip it right out with
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:52.160]   their hand yeah with their hand but they were really just surgical about it they'd use a thick
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:58.320]   obsidian knife where they could just break the ribs right along the sternum and then push the sternum
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:05.760]   down pull up and just while the person was alive yep while the person was alive and the aztecs had this
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:11.440]   idea like there was a there was a horrible drought that went on that almost ruined the entire valley and
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:17.200]   they came to this conclusion that it's because we haven't been killing enough people right we've got
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:22.640]   to bump this up and then when they did and they decided they they really took it out on the clash
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:27.440]   collins it rained again so it was proof positive that they should just keep doing that
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:36.640]   and they ate people as well they really did as part of the sacrifice or is this after the sacrifice
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:41.600]   then they would eat them and this was part of the drought and the famine thing that started but then
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:47.280]   it was just kind of the thing to do when uh when cortez got there they were still having certain
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:55.600]   special feasts that involved humans and and it really upset the spanish that they would be like
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:02.480]   uh tricked into eating human like hey you liking dinner that was a human so the idea was it actually uh
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:11.040]   having having having a taste for human flesh or is it just you know these kinds of ideas of like if
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:15.440]   you eat a person's heart that you can get their spirit and their strength and in the case of the
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:22.400]   aztecs it seemed like they just liked it uh this guy sahagun who was a very responsible uh chronicler
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:29.920]   that was pretty specific that like uh there was a distribution thing yeah like the uh the the elites got
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:36.080]   butts the butts were the best part so the the butt cheeks those are the best parts to eat and then
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:42.160]   like it went down the chain until some people just got like fingers and toes literally bought taste
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:48.320]   for the aztec yeah boy all right they really they really did they really did in fact that's what caused
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:55.840]   the uh have you heard of the noche triste the sad night the night that the aztecs really go nuts on the
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:04.880]   spanish and kick them out it's all triggered by this this one guy um pedro de alvarado who's left in
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:12.560]   charge by cortez as cortez goes to the coast and tries to uh talk to the new force talk him into being
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:19.840]   for him which he does but pedro alvarado's left back in town in charge and they're doing another one of
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:28.640]   these huge aztec buffets and uh parties to honor them and it happens the guy says you know hey do you
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:32.800]   like dinner like oh yeah it's a nice dinner well it's humans you're eating humans see i told you they
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:41.760]   were good and alvarado just freaks out and he has the the guards close the doors and he murders everyone in
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:50.960]   the in the party women children nobody has weapons he just murders everyone and that's what spazzes the
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:59.120]   the aztecs out to eventually murder montezuma who was their captive and then try to murder all of them
[02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:05.680]   and it was all it was all pedro alvarado's fault for freaking out about eating humans just a little
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:10.400]   practical joke yeah it was just they thought it was funny he did not that's fascinating i didn't
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:15.200]   realize so i kind of assumed that some level of cannibalism would have to do with you know eating
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:20.960]   the heart to um to gain the spirit of the person or something like this but in in certain like a you
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:25.840]   know deer hunting rituals things for sure but the aztecs no they just liked eating humans it was part of
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:31.520]   the fear factor too i mean they could walk into a new town and be like you guys could either send us you
[02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:38.320]   know a number of quetzal feathers every month or we could eat you so that's psychological warfare and
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:44.720]   actual warfare it worked and that's how they spread and they were just about to take over the maya when
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:50.000]   the spanish came and messed everything up they they were they had the maya surrounded and they were about
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:56.320]   to take over the whole yucatan so you think without the spanish there would be this aztec empire that
[02:30:56.320 --> 02:31:01.280]   would last for a very long time well i think there would have been an aztec empire i think they would
[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:07.760]   have finished dominating everybody but they did it through hate and everybody hated the aztecs
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:14.080]   they so it wouldn't have lasted forever they did not they were not ruling justly they were ruling by
[02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:20.960]   force and that that can only go on so long before revolution happens the inca empire i think that
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:27.280]   would have gone on forever because they were really community oriented once the inca took over like
[02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:33.120]   no one in the inca empire starved they built architecture everyone was safe
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:39.600]   they was it was a society that could have lasted a long time what was the origin of the inca empire
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:44.640]   well it was bloody at first like most of them are but once uh
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:50.800]   one once they started taking over that what they did is they empire built they everybody else had just
[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:56.560]   raided their neighbors to get the resources but everybody they raided they turned them into the
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:32:04.720]   inca empire and they created this uh incredible uh mita system where you took turns working
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:11.760]   and they created the road system so they could get groups of workers back and forth so a town of let's
[02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:20.000]   say 5 000 people uh the inca would roll up with an army of 100 200 000 people and say you know would
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.880]   you guys like to be part of the empire or would you like us to escort you to the edge of the empire
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:31.840]   and if your mayor here agrees then he can have a town he can have a house in cusco but then the very next
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:39.840]   month a big work crew would show up and they'd start building agricultural terraces and storage units and
[02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:49.360]   every month with the agricultural uh excess they would have big parties and everybody would eat so
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:55.200]   people lived well in the inca empire it was a rough beginning but everybody who agreed to be part of it
[02:32:55.200 --> 02:33:02.800]   immediately had access to a whole bunch of resources and security they never had so they started in
[02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:09.520]   south america and peru and cusco cusco was like the center of it cusco in their language quechua
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:17.360]   it means naval or belly button and it's up in the the mountains but there's four quarters that they
[02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:24.720]   called their empire tiwantinsuyu the land of four quarters and the center of those four quarters was
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:34.320]   cusco it sprung to life what in like 12 1200 a d c yeah we we backwards project what it was but it was
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:43.840]   probably mid 1200s when the first sapa inca the first ruler came in but it was the i think it's the
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:52.480]   ninth one is pachacute who really started being an empire builder and part of that i mean what really
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:34:00.640]   really defined empire as you said roads they build a massive road network roads and uh in the same way
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:06.720]   that the the roman strategy of building roads and infrastructure and then every place they took over
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:14.880]   they'd create certain key pieces of roman architecture that kind of made that city roman and they'd rename
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:24.240]   it something the inca did the same thing they had certain signature inca architecture that they would
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:32.000]   build in as the administrative part they'd send uh they'd send the khipu kumayak the the the guys who
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:39.920]   would weave the or not the khipus as accountants and they would go through and say what everybody did
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.720]   okay you know you're a good farmer you're going to farm you are a good weaver you're going to weave
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:50.720]   all the men here are going to take a turn at being part of the army and and they then they sent
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:56.480]   independent khipu kumayaks to that every community had like five or six that were not allowed to work
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:02.240]   with each other and they all had to independently send their khipus back to cusco and if there were
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:06.800]   accounting discrepancies they were called to cusco to figure out who was lying about what
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:12.480]   so there's like a super sophisticated record keeping system yeah and that was the khipu
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:18.560]   and the spanish recorded what they could and then burned them all but that's an interesting development
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:25.520]   for for an empire because that allows you to really expand and uh have some kind of management some some
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.600]   level of control yeah they couldn't at the end they were at least 10 million people and there was just
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:37.520]   no way to do that without some sort of sophisticated record keeping system if the inca had
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:45.600]   to face aztec who wins inca inca i mean the aztecs were psychotic but the inca had just reserves for
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:52.160]   miles right and they had that essential hearts and minds right and there was only one thing that
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:58.000]   everybody got pissed off about when they joined the inca empire for some reason everything was owned
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:07.360]   communally except the llamas the llamas were the kings and so that was one thing that like some of them would stay in
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:12.960]   town just to be work llamas but you know you don't own your llama anymore and and people are really
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:19.040]   attached to their llamas to this day yeah they are like family members so it'd be like everybody walked
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:26.000]   in and said everybody's family dog is now mine like really upset people on an emotional level well i mean
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:34.080]   so llamas uh got domesticated at some point probably early i mean what i don't even know when but early on
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:42.480]   it's uh we we have rock art that progresses to make it see like a progression from people depicted hunting
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:49.680]   them to people depicted standing next to pregnant ones yeah so it was still in that archaic period at
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:56.400]   least that they became friends uh yeah but if you roll in and you own them that's uh yeah that pissed
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:02.800]   everybody off that for some reason the inca owned everybody's llama instantly and he would take anything
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:09.360]   he wanted a lot of them would just get carted away that day just sent to cusco they'd also take their
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:16.480]   mummies that was a weird thing everybody mourns they're dead but the inca just like ceased to accept it
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:20.880]   they would just the mummies were still there okay he's dead but look he still got clothes he's at the
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:27.440]   party let's put a beer in front of him they just like they just kept people as mummies and so the
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:36.720]   ancestral mummies of every town part of the being absorbed into the the empire was okay your most
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:43.680]   important mummies are now going to have their own beautiful house in cusco but they would physically
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:51.200]   bring those mummies to cusco to make now cusco the spiritual heart of their their belief system
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.600]   i mean i could see how that would piss people off but it's also a pretty powerful way to
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:04.880]   say like the ancestors that you idolize that you respect are now in the capital they've been elevated
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:11.040]   we didn't steal them we have given them a new place of honor and you're welcome to come visit them all the
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:16.960]   time and they did they have these festivals where everyone from all corners of the inca world would
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:24.560]   come to cusco and uh which of the civilizations mummified people is it is it the incas for sure
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:32.560]   mummified people and even did some of that kind of uh like egyptian-esque taking out of organs and
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:39.440]   preparing the body they put like straw inside the cavity and mummify them but the maya didn't do it at all
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:50.000]   the maya in fact on purpose would flood tombs with water so that the skin would float off the skeletons
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:55.760]   faster and then they'd get back in there it was jungly so i think the bugs probably had part of it
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:02.000]   too but then they would get back in there to get the bones they'd open it back up and take the bones out
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:08.560]   and paint them with red cinnabar the one that i was in in copan we had evidence that they had gone in
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:14.720]   there four different times and the last couple times they only took the skull out and repainted
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:22.400]   it and then put it back in articulated in the on the skeleton but they they didn't mummify they on purpose
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:30.080]   would like grossly float the bodies so so they could get the skin off faster and get to the bones but would
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:34.400]   they keep the bones yeah they'd keep the bones and they'd pull the bones out occasionally
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:40.960]   and do rituals to them or commune with them and then put them back in so there's a still a deep
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.600]   connection to the ancestors to the physical manifestation of the ancestors then yeah well
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:51.760]   they're mummified or bone and to this day like if if you do an excavation here in the united states
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:57.600]   native american people don't like it they don't like their graves which is fine enough i wouldn't want
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:04.320]   somebody digging up my grandma either but the maya they love it they love it every maya person if we
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:11.360]   find a grave they're like yeah look at that bones cool can i touch yeah they they're not spooked about
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:19.440]   it at all they think it's exciting i one time as uh helped out a a physical anthropologist in town and
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:26.800]   in copan to get a osteology collection together of various animals so if we got bones from a uh
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:31.680]   an excavation we could see what kind of animal it was based on the collection
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:40.560]   and this family said uh well we our family dog died last year and buried him in the backyard you go dig him
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:46.960]   up and so we were like okay yeah i mean we do need a dog we'll go take up your dog and then they were like
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:51.920]   but the kids really want to help you so their kids came out yeah and this was like their puppy and it
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.480]   died you know less than a year ago when we got to it that like that one of them just like grabbed up
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:04.000]   a bone and he was like we see see those like little bitty bones yeah like what a weird attitude that's
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.960]   your dead dog there but they just they have a different relationship with the dead it's some sense
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:14.720]   that's a beautiful attitude right yeah why um pretend like we're not mortal and there's not
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:21.840]   this is just the process of it and it's kind of as you say it now it kind of would be cool that's what
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:27.840]   day of the dead is all about and i love day of the dead uh you know halloween's this creepy thing where
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:33.040]   they're all monsters but day of the dead is this beautiful time where we remember our ancestors i
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:39.120]   convinced my kids after the movie coco came out now we have an altar with all of our great
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:44.480]   grandparents on the altar and we talk about who they were and how they lived and we put things on
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:49.680]   the altar that mattered in their life and we remember them on that day and it turned something that was a
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:56.000]   weird eat too much candy and wear a monster mask thing into something beautiful where we discuss where
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:04.480]   we came from i have to ask about the giant stones the inca has been able to somehow move and fit together
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:13.680]   perfectly do you understand is it understood how they were able to do that so well no
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:23.440]   um you know the moving of it i think that we have reasonable theories you know there there are ways to
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:33.040]   pivot large weights uh there's a there's a great guy uh named wally wallington a retired contractor
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:42.720]   here in the u.s who built stonehenge in his backyard in minnesota single-handedly showing how you can move
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:49.200]   big stones so i you know i think wally's already figured out how to move them it's the it's the perfectly
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:54.960]   fit so carefully fit together that you couldn't even put a diamond between the stones that's the
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:43:02.240]   one that i think still has people baffled the the common archaeological wisdom that you'd find out of uh
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:09.520]   textbook is that they just kept packing away at it with hammer stones and setting them and resetting them
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:16.160]   until they were perfect which has to be that is there is no way that they just
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:24.080]   were that meticulous i mean everybody's got a hammerstone i i personally think it's acids i think
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:30.960]   they melted them um together and there are weird places when you really look at closely to these
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:36.960]   stones which i've done a number of times i'm going back next month to uh machu picchu and especially
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:44.160]   cusco i walk around in the alleys where these 500 you know to a thousand year old walls are still there
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:57.840]   and uh you see i see things like the the crystals in the andesite are uh almost stitched together along
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:04.400]   the seams like there's the the andesite around it is melted and the crystals haven't and there are other
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:12.640]   places where there are weird wipes on the wall like it's just melted like somebody like took a rag
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:20.080]   and wiped it while it was soft lots of talk about soft stones turning hard too i i haven't been able
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:26.480]   to prove it this is one of these you know end of my archaeological career chapters i'm either going to
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:33.120]   prove myself wrong or prove it but i think they used acids my dad's a chemist and he told me a long time
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:40.000]   ago that there's no way there's no naturally occurring acids but my current theory actually
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.880]   i got the idea initially from the show breaking bad i don't know if you ever saw that show but
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:52.720]   there's a point in which they're trying to dissolve a body yeah and they're using hydrofluoric acid and
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:58.720]   it goes right through the ceiling that hydrofluoric acid is so fascinating it you know it it won't go
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:08.640]   through plastic and you can also bring it in inert parts and then combine it um the the inca made tons
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:17.760]   of jewelry out of fluorite fluorite is big in the andes and they also mind a lot of things for gold and
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:26.480]   silver and the byproduct of that mining is sulfuric acid you put sulfuric acid and fluorite together
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:33.600]   and it's hydrofluoric acid and that will burn through andesite or anything and if you learned how to do
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:40.000]   it you know judiciously and then you didn't care whether you know servants lost a an arm or two
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:45.600]   then you could actually use them to fuse these together and i i think they're fused together
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:55.520]   i i asked the city of cuzco if i could take some core samples and they said go away gringo don't touch
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:02.320]   our walls so this actually this next this next time i'm going to go try to talk to the more quechua
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:09.680]   authorities in a place called oleantaytambo and maybe i can convince them but right now they just think i'm
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:18.400]   a i'm a weird ass gringo who wants to put holes in their walls it's a fascinating theory and so the
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:23.760]   how could you get to the the bottom of that so getting core samples to see if there's some kind
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:30.160]   of trace chemists i'm working with say that if there was hydrofluoric acid in between these that
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:37.200]   a core sample right along a seam they they can separate out the elements in there and detect
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:42.640]   whether there was actually elements of hydrofluoric acid i wanted to go straight to burning rocks but
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:48.080]   they were like no i mean we already know that's true i mean yeah we can burn some rocks but it would
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:53.840]   happen that's just chemistry we gotta we gotta prove that it would happen in the walls so go get us samples
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:59.840]   and that was before covid and all sorts of you know you know how it is you probably are the same guy where
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:05.520]   you've got a a thousand ideas and you know the ones that that are fruitful you run with and the other
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:11.520]   ones you'll get back to you that would be fascinating if true and i hope you do show that it's true or follow
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:21.520]   either one yeah i'll try to disprove it yeah i wonder if we discount how much amazing stuff a collection of
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:29.520]   humans can do because it just feels like if a large number of humans are eight are just working
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:37.040]   a little bit chipping away at stuff at scale that can do miraculous things so the question is how can
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:45.440]   a large number of humans be motivated to do a thing um because i just when we think about like stonehenger
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:51.440]   some very challenging architectural construction we don't think about a large number of humans working
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:59.200]   together well you know that large number of humans uh are motivated to work together by a small number of
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:06.160]   administrators who are dynamic and convincing in some way or another right one of my favorite quotes is
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:11.840]   and i'm probably going to misquote it here but i think it's margaret mead who said never underestimate
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:20.000]   the power of small groups working together and the truth is that those are the only people that have
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:27.280]   ever changed the world that small dedicated groups of people are what changed the world yeah and they inspire big
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:35.440]   groups of people to embrace their vision yeah yeah yeah i think we sometimes underestimate how much humans
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:41.520]   can do uh across time and we are way less capable than we used to be i mean the average human had all
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:48.800]   sorts of skills that at least i personally do not you know i i i'm wearing a shirt but i i can't make a shirt
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:58.960]   that's for somebody else to do you've also lectured about uh which i really enjoyed about north america
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:06.480]   and also helped teach me that there's a lot more complex societies going on here
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:14.480]   for a long period of time so maybe can we start at the beginning who were the early humans in north america
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:21.360]   well we go through that paleo indian and archaic period for thousands of years you know as we
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:29.440]   started this conversation probably you know 30 000 years as a conservative now humans first enter the
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:38.240]   americas but the first cultures we get here are mound builders around the mississippi and to the east
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:45.200]   and then also a totally separate group in the what we call the american southwest now the four corners
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:52.320]   who will develop into mostly the people we call the pueblo people who are still there today like zuni and
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:50:02.720]   hopi people so we've got these two clusters that the very first major community in north america is in the most
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:10.240]   unlikely place it's in northern louisiana people think i'm crazy when i say this but there is a pyramid
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:20.960]   in northern louisiana a big one at a site called poverty point that is uh 3 500 years old so it's the same age
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:29.760]   as the pyramids in egypt and it is a giant thing just poking out of the bayous of louisiana
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:37.120]   and uh people don't believe me when i say it but it's there the mound builders what was that society
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:41.760]   like in comparison to everything else we've been talking about in mesoamerica they they evolved over
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:46.400]   thousands of years we call them mound builders this is something i you know object to i think we should
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:54.800]   have a better we do the last uh version of them we call the mississippians now but generally speaking
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:51:00.640]   we call all these guys mound builders but what they built were pyramids they look like mounds now
[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:06.400]   and they didn't build them out of stone that's you know that's kind of our just inherent western bias
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:13.200]   something that's built out of stone is is sophisticated and something that's built out of dirt is rudimentary
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:22.640]   but in their full living form they did have cores of dirt but then they also had uh kind of clay caps so
[02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:30.080]   they had terraces they had whole complexes of buildings up on top there were kings that lived up there
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:37.440]   there's uh the the biggest of the mississippian cities is called cahokia and it's right outside of
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:47.440]   uh st louis and it was huge it had a population of 20 000 people and pyramids all over the place a huge
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:56.320]   palisade wall around it it was absolutely gigantic a thriving metropolis and we in america have kind
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:52:04.720]   of a collective amnesia like we we never hear about these massive civilizations cahokia was the the big
[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:12.720]   first city but then it spread from the mississippi all the way to the atlantic there were hundreds and
[02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:20.480]   hundreds of these big cities that had you know five to ten thousand people each were they their own
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:26.720]   thing or is there some kind of thread connecting all of them they had a unified religion and culture they
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:33.200]   were again not an empire so there were warring city-states there were kind of uh territories that
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:40.160]   were owned by big kings and then the cities around them were kind of the subsidiary lords and kings
[02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:49.040]   and then one one one kingdom could either ally with a neighbor or have a fight so they were they were
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:56.320]   kind of uh countries i think for yeah we could safely say there were different countries within
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:53:03.840]   this patchwork that was eastern united states and you know it's so weird that we don't know this because
[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:11.760]   it was clearly documented by the by the spanish it's this i'm not talking about just archaeology we find
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:19.760]   them in archaeology now but hernando de soto landed in florida and went for three years from he went up
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:28.000]   into the carolinas and over down into alabama and louisiana and he's the first one to see the mississippi
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:36.640]   up there but for three years he went through city after city after city unfortunately decimating them
[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:43.920]   eating all their corn giving them diseases but uh i mean the documentation is clearly there he met
[02:53:43.920 --> 02:53:52.720]   collectively millions of people in a very sophisticated and uniform civilization those disease
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:54:01.520]   and uh stealing of resources but was there like explicit murdering going on unfortunately yeah he
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:10.720]   was a murderer and a psycho and a liar he uh he he snowed them that he was some kind of deity actually
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:17.040]   learned a trick from the inca who he was with pizarro in his first run and got went back to spain was
[02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:24.400]   rich had a wife a castle then he got bored and he decided to have a reign of terror on northern america
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:34.160]   for three years but he had people uh burned at the stake he had his dogs ripped them apart he was very very
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:43.760]   brutal he he ruled that area through fear and had absolutely no respect for anybody he made promises and
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:53.120]   broke them all the time he was really he was a brutal man so this whole period when uh christopher columbus
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:55:03.360]   came how did that change everything well you know there's a there's a great uh anthropological uh body
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:09.680]   of literature it's it's called the columbian exchange based on columbus but it's you know all this trade back
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:17.120]   and forth between the new world and the old world and the the old world got just wonderful stuff all of
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:26.160]   a sudden their diet didn't suck all these vegetables came in the the new world got uh herd animals it got
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:35.840]   pigs and cows and goats that it didn't have but it also got 13 infectious diseases uh europe had had wave
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:41.040]   wave after wave and kind of had herd immunity on a lot of things but it didn't actually go away
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:44.640]   it just couldn't spread like a wildfire through the community
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:52.880]   so when they arrived to the americas all of a sudden these just a pile of horrible diseases hit people
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.960]   i think in the first 20 30 years there were people who like
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:06.080]   had contracted multiple deadly diseases at once and died of them but the numbers you know it's
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:11.920]   it's a it's a shameful part of history and it wasn't something that europe perpetrated on them
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:18.560]   the medical science at that time was still the four humors theory that people were made of yellow bile
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:24.080]   black bile blood and phlegm and we did things like well you've got to bleed him he'll feel better then
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:29.600]   so we had no idea what an infectious disease was but the reality was that this
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:36.960]   horde of diseases hit everyone and the numbers are now saying in the first 50 years that it
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:45.520]   90 of everybody was dead and that the the number of people has increased as well as far as the
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:55.200]   our estimates we're thinking it's somewhere around 150 million people and 90 of them died and with them
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:57:02.240]   all their knowledge just i mean imagine the moment where you know who dies when things get bad it's the
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:11.680]   young and the old so all the knowledge keepers die suddenly the children die this next generation that's half
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:19.520]   taught and now completely demoralized thinking that this is a spiritual attack that their gods hate them
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:26.400]   that the only way out of it is to uh to accept this new christianity but they you know they don't have
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:31.600]   bring kids into this world where everybody's dying and even if they do they can't teach them
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:37.280]   what the old people were going to teach them because the old people are gone and didn't finish the transmission
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:45.360]   so in a in a single terrible moment in human history you know the generation loses all their knowledge
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:53.920]   so a lot of the things that these people knew just blipped out but with that also just the the wisdom of
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:58:04.640]   the entire civilizations so much of what they knew was just lost at that moment we have the maya who had
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:10.000]   those hieroglyphs and that we've learned a lot from that yeah but not a significant integration of
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:17.520]   that wisdom into so it wasn't uh when the europeans came it wasn't like the cultures were integrated
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:24.960]   it was um a story of domination in the north in north america there's a a new term in the literature
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:32.800]   that i like we call it the uh the mississippian shatter zone that mississippian civilization was millions of
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:37.360]   people but they got spread out all over the place over the next centuries and now
[02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:44.560]   we have this shatter zone where we have how ruins and the people that were actually from those ruins
[02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:51.520]   are somewhere else on a reservation far away and you know that i'm just about to talk to a cherokee man
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:56.880]   who listened to some of the things i had to say and says all those ho-chunk things you were saying from
[02:58:56.880 --> 02:59:02.480]   that ho-chunk culture my grandparents talk about this sort of thing too can i can i talk to you by
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:07.920]   phone and tell you about these things so we've got this shatter zone where you know we're gonna try to
[02:59:07.920 --> 02:59:15.920]   put the piece the puzzle back together especially in terms of mississippian religion i really think we're
[02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:23.200]   making headway in this generation and it's exciting to be part of piecing this old religion and its
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:29.280]   mythology back together just as uh since a lot of people kind of refer to christopher columbus as the
[02:59:29.280 --> 02:59:37.520]   person who discovered america um i read that the vikings reached north america uh much earlier in um 1000
[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:45.280]   ce and uh why do you think they didn't expand and colonize because they got their ass kicked
[02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:53.360]   okay it's the truth yeah it is absolutely true that the vikings were here there's a there's a great
[02:59:53.360 --> 03:00:02.320]   uh site in nova scotia called lenso meadows which definitely has what's left of a viking colony it was
[03:00:02.320 --> 03:00:07.280]   leaf eric and his father eric the red who they got kind of kicked out of europe because they
[03:00:07.280 --> 03:00:13.200]   apparently couldn't stop murdering people and so they went to greenland and then kind of island
[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:18.960]   hopped over to canada but i think the culture that was in that area it was named the dorset
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:25.600]   but they would have nothing to do with the vikings they they attacked the viking settlement every day
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:31.840]   and did not give them an inch until they decided it was just worthless and they left it you know the
[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:38.160]   vikings attacked ireland and they just found a bunch of you know monasteries full of gold with a bunch
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:43.920]   of guys going we're men of god we don't fight and the vikings were like this is great that's great this
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:50.160]   will be easy then we'll just loot all these easter eggs but the native americans in canada were like
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:57.680]   not having it they kicked their ass in fact uh leaf ericsson's brother thor died there the the natives
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:03.120]   killed him he was supposed to be in charge of expanding the settlement but they they just killed
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:10.240]   him so a lot of the native american cultures were also i mean they're sophisticated warring cultures also
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:17.360]   yes they fought especially the the mississippians boy they were tough and so were uh you know the the
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:24.800]   five nations the mohawk the huron those the ones that that kicked the viking's ass up there they were
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:32.640]   probably uh algonquin speakers but they were connected like you know just above the the great lakes but
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:40.560]   they were all a very tough people when you think about the spaniards and the the portuguese and the
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:47.760]   over 100 million people that were killed um do you see that as a tragedy of history or is it just the way of
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:56.320]   history i think that the epidemics i i consider it a tragedy that did not have to happen and that was
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:03.440]   not you know that was not a fair fight nobody knew what to do about it there was just a a tragic perfect
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:10.800]   storm of events it was not you know they i think that the spanish and the portuguese get unfairly maligned
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:16.480]   in what's been called the the black legend that they just marched into america and murdered everyone
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:23.120]   that's not the fact that it was the diseases that murdered everyone in fact there was a a really poignant
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:34.800]   uh story i read of a a spanish priest in the amazon in the in the brazilian northern part of the amazon where he made this utopian community
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:40.400]   and he was bringing people in that were getting sick and he he wrote you know i'm baptizing
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:47.360]   everyone you know i have baptized 10 000 people a day and yet god's still killing them why is he doing
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:53.280]   this to them they're doing everything that i asked them to do they are submitting to the will of god
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:59.920]   but this guy doesn't realize that the same bowl of holy water that he's baptizing them in he's just wiping
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:05.920]   the disease on everybody's faces he's accelerating it when he doesn't even realize he thinks he's saving
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:14.560]   them but he's actually killing them yeah that's a trap that's a tragedy you know that's not just like
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:22.720]   spoils go to the victor stuff that's just straight up tragedy yeah yeah but that one is even hard to know
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:28.960]   what to do with like black death it's i mean infections they don't operate on normal human
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:39.440]   terms right they just they just go through entire populations back to wild ideas all right just my style
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:45.520]   um i mean we didn't really talk about how life originated on earth or how
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:54.400]   uh how humans have evolved and we did talk about that there could be just a lot of stuff in ancient
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:04:02.960]   history we haven't even uncovered yet uh do you think it's possible that other intelligent civilizations
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:11.920]   from outside of earth aliens ever visited you had me right until the ever visited thing that one i'm not
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:18.560]   entirely sure about i'm not sure whether we have any we certainly have no archaeological proof that i would
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:27.920]   uh cite or contemplate as the evidence of such but you know uh you know the guys that that discovered dna
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:37.680]   watson and crick uh watson uh who actually habitually used hallucinogens to to uh invigorate his thinking he
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:46.240]   said that he thought that dna on this planet was way too complex to have developed over the time period
[03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:54.880]   that it had at its disposal and that his guess was that our dna was somehow seeded from outside of our
[03:04:54.880 --> 03:05:01.840]   planet and you know take that for what it is but the guy who we respect on many other levels also said that
[03:05:02.960 --> 03:05:10.880]   um so that's interesting but in terms of you know aliens visiting us i i don't know i it does smack
[03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:17.280]   of a kind of human hubris that we think we're important enough for some advanced species to give
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:23.920]   a about us statistically speaking the universe is way too big we can't be the only sentient beings
[03:05:23.920 --> 03:05:29.920]   there's got to be somebody else out there whether they care about us that's a question i've been on
[03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:36.160]   ancient aliens a number of times i show up and you know i'm an educator i mean refusing to be part of
[03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:43.040]   the conversations an immediate fail in my book um but there was one time where they asked me at the
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:51.120]   end you know do you have anything else uh do you want to say and i said well you know yeah y'all's premise
[03:05:51.120 --> 03:05:58.160]   is that aliens came down a long time ago and they gave humanity these wonderful gifts of you know science
[03:05:58.160 --> 03:06:04.240]   and medicine engineering all these things today we also have a lot of uh
[03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:11.680]   stories of the aliens coming down but now all they're doing is mutilating cows and sodomizing
[03:06:11.680 --> 03:06:20.320]   rednecks like whatever we did we super pissed them off apparently the quality of the gifts has decreased
[03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:28.880]   rapidly um what it's interesting thought you've mentioned what archaeologically would you have to
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:37.760]   see to be like this might be an alien a technology that doesn't belong there first and foremost i mean
[03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:45.520]   you know we gotta it if we just run with the premise that somebody was capable of making a vehicle that
[03:06:45.520 --> 03:06:53.440]   could get them from somewhere far away to here that was almost certainly mechanical now i you know i love
[03:06:53.440 --> 03:06:58.560]   the aliens thing where you know biomechanical is something that that certainly could be and that would
[03:06:58.560 --> 03:07:04.640]   you know that that would uh disintegrate we wouldn't see that at all but i would expect some kind of uh
[03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:12.000]   technology that that showed up out of the blue and change things that would be something um but but i
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:18.560]   would think you know mechanical right or you know a substance that's not from here but of course we
[03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:24.960]   would only see the the results of that mechanical you mean like literally a mechanical thing right some
[03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:31.120]   sort of thing like that uh you know it the typical thing people say is like you know how did they move
[03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:37.680]   these giant stones right but you know let's just just look at that on the face for a second aliens come
[03:07:37.680 --> 03:07:45.920]   from across the universe to meet humans and the thing they tell them is how to move rocks are you
[03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:51.280]   fucking kidding me i mean you know like give them give them antibiotics or a combustion engine or something
[03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:57.200]   you're gonna they said they came across the universe and they showed them how to move big rocks i mean
[03:07:57.200 --> 03:08:04.480]   that doesn't make any sense that just doesn't make any sense what do you think earth will look like
[03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:14.400]   10 000 years from now that's an interesting question i think it will be a lot more automated
[03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:21.200]   or it'll be a smoldering pile i mean if there is a possibility we could end ourselves
[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:27.200]   there's always that possibility that we've really opened pandora's box in some regards
[03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:34.720]   i i did listen to one of your podcast guests with the uh what would happen in the case of nuclear war
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:41.120]   yeah that was chilling her opinion was certainly we would burn everything to a crisp within minutes
[03:08:41.120 --> 03:08:47.760]   apparently so we we have that capacity that's scary that's a possible future for us but i'm an optimist
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:52.320]   i'd you know i'd like to think that guys like you are going to make friendly robots who make my job better
[03:08:52.320 --> 03:09:03.840]   but a thousand ten thousand years is a long time and uh technology is improving and becoming more advanced
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:11.680]   rapidly and uh the rate of that improvement is increasing ever more so that that's the part that frightens me
[03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:17.680]   actually i don't know does that frighten you yes terrifying you know i i i heard somebody say i forget
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:27.040]   who it was but you know uh systems of any kind human systems biological systems can be put on a graph
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:39.520]   that's change over time and any graph that the change is way faster than the time and the and the the line
[03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:47.600]   starts going straight up that is a system in crisis in almost any biological system that has that fast a
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:54.880]   change over that little time you would any any other thing you'd describe it as a crisis when you apply
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:10:02.800]   that chart to technologies change it's a crisis from that perspective absolutely but i also have a faith
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:12.960]   in human ingenuity that we humans like to create a really difficult situation and then come up with ways to uh
[03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:19.200]   get out of that difficult situation and in so doing innovate and create a lot of awesome stuff and
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:27.280]   sometimes cause a lot of suffering but on the whole on average uh make a better world but yeah if it you
[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:35.120]   know like with nuclear weapons the bad stuff might actually lead to the death of everybody i guess
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:41.200]   there's always that that chance but i am an optimist i you know i think you're an optimist too i i think
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:48.480]   exactly as you just said i think that the greatest capacity of humans is our ability to innovate and
[03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:56.000]   we are never more innovative than when we're under distress i think that a lot of the developments of
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:02.720]   humans over the last thousands of years have been about you know we didn't we didn't change the world when
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:10.480]   we were comfortable it was when we were in crisis mother necessity is the mother of invention and i think we'll be
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:19.120]   all right i think that uh this impending uh climate crisis is real and happening i actually personally
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:22.560]   think that uh i'm gonna i'm gonna answer a question that you didn't even ask me
[03:11:22.560 --> 03:11:33.200]   um i think we're wasting our time thinking that we can reverse this we're uh delusional i'm all for
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:36.480]   electric cars and uh you know uh being good stewards of the environment but uh you know uh being good
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:44.080]   stewards of the environment but we are wasting our time not technologically adapting to what's about
[03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:50.560]   to happen we're spending too much time pretending you know the average american thinks if we all just drive
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:55.920]   electric cars will be okay that's bullshit that's not going to happen we need to start making
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:12:02.160]   technologies that desalinize water that you know a host of things that uh that we need to use our
[03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:10.080]   technological past capacity to accept it and adapt instead of pollyanna thinking we can make it go away
[03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:18.160]   yeah yeah kind of accept that the world will change and uh a lot of big problems will arise
[03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:24.800]   and just develop technology that addresses them i think you have some some guys that have their finger
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:28.160]   on the pulse there we need to start thinking about how we're going to survive this not that we're going
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:34.800]   to make it go away and not just survive thrive um again we're pretty innovative in that regard
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:44.080]   but if some catastrophic thing happens or we just leave this planet what uh what do you think would be
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:50.960]   found by a aforementioned alien civilizations when they visit the anthropologists the grad student
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:59.680]   anthropologists that visit earth and study how much of what we now have and love and think of as human
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:07.840]   civilization will be lost do you think well you know time moves on and things that are perishable perish
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:14.640]   so you know you didn't put a time element in there but i would say that you know everything that can
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:21.200]   perish will and whoever shows up here will be stuck with only the things that didn't perish so we'll have
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:28.480]   you know buildings plaques but they won't have any books they won't have any you know billboards there
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:38.880]   they'll have the incomplete record i have i i one time did a did a talk in sue falls and i said you
[03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:48.480]   know i drove in here and there was a big obelisk in front of the town and everywhere i go i see the names
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:54.880]   lewis and clark and a thousand years from now if i was an archaeologist investigating this place i would
[03:13:54.880 --> 03:14:02.000]   think that it was founded by the egyptians and their kings were named lewis and clark but the truth is
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:09.200]   you know lewis and clark stayed one night here but it's just a big deal so i would be so wrong about what
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:16.160]   i thought about your town based on what preserved this is so beautiful as a thought experiment like what
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:23.120]   would archaeologists be really wrong about and what would they could possibly be right about washington
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:28.800]   dc was clearly made by a combination of the egyptians and the greeks and the romans because
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:35.760]   that's what all the architecture is yeah and would they be able to reconstruct the important empires
[03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:43.360]   the the the powerful empires and the the warring empires for that matter have me and my colleagues
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:49.120]   done that at all i i'm almost certain that the maya would just gut laugh at what i think i know what they
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:56.560]   were i wonder do you ever think about like what we just as a human civilization are wrong about the most
[03:14:56.560 --> 03:15:02.720]   like mainstream archaeology just like a suspicion what what could we get completely wrong
[03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:10.960]   uh well one way to get something wrong is totally like lost civils like an obviously gigantic
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:17.520]   civilization that was there along with the maya or something like this in the 10 000 years ago there's
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:22.880]   certainly that there could be things that were either wiped away or still hiding under the oceans that
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:28.000]   would completely change the way we think about things and everybody knew they existed and everybody
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:33.520]   interacted with them it was i think i think i think it's our estimation of their motivations that were
[03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:40.160]   probably most wrong on my uh my teacher shealy a long time ago said you know i i've come up with all
[03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:45.440]   sorts of theories i was always thinking about stuff and she looked at me and she said if you don't stop
[03:15:45.440 --> 03:15:52.800]   thinking like a western european and start trying to put yourself in the mindset of these people you
[03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:59.280]   will never understand any of it which i've always taken to heart i mean i really do when i approach these
[03:15:59.280 --> 03:16:07.680]   things i try to step out of my cultural assumptions trying to think like they would think is the best i could
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:13.280]   and it's very different i mean this whole you know the maya are are cyclical you know this the the whole
[03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:20.480]   sacrifice we're so you know obsessed with that but you know that was an austere actual sacrifice on
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:25.840]   their part they weren't just you know hey let's all get together and kill that guy that's pissing us off i
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:32.880]   mean they were like you know giving the best of them it was it was a different mentality this was not brutal this
[03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:40.240]   was a you know bona fide sacrifice on their part a loss plus the whole mystery of of the puppy
[03:16:40.240 --> 03:16:46.240]   that eventually starts having sex with this i tell you that one i'm gonna unweave that one one of these
[03:16:46.240 --> 03:16:53.760]   days one of these days now this that puppy appeared on the on pottery all over pottery yeah he's he's
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:59.840]   he's everywhere i gotta write this book i this next year is the year i'm gonna write my fang deity book and i will
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:07.760]   have a whole chapter dedicated to the puppy the mystery solved i mean it could just be the birth of
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:13.280]   memes of humor i don't know i mean again humor you don't know what the nature of their humor of what
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:19.280]   their jokes are oh that's a neat one too then that's so human you know that i'll tell you a little like
[03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:27.120]   side story here that uh when i worked with the maya people in palenque i spent three years making this map
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:33.280]   of the city and hiking through the jungle every day and they would talk to each other in their own
[03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:38.880]   language uh it was uh sell tall was the group i was working with but i noticed after a while they were
[03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:43.680]   they were big jokers they loved to make jokes and they would laugh at jokes but then they would also
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:49.680]   one of them would say something and the other ones would go hoo hoo and i eventually asked you know
[03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:55.680]   what is that why do you guys always make that hoo hoo noise they said that's because he made a really
[03:17:55.680 --> 03:18:02.240]   smart pun it was like he said three different things at once it was a turn of phrase that was smart
[03:18:02.240 --> 03:18:08.320]   and they didn't make laughs at that it was there they had a noise for when somebody said something just
[03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:16.000]   super clever yeah so there's also that like you know just clever turn of speech yeah wit and i think
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:21.760]   about that when i'm a uh uh hieroglyphic translator like here's a beautiful thing that's going to be
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:28.800]   like a poem or a political statement like and i'm just plottingly looking in a dictionary of what that
[03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:35.040]   word means there's probably double triple entendres all through this text and the real meaning is the
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:40.080]   subtext and i'm you know i'm thinking they're talking about corn and they're talking about the nature of
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:46.960]   life yeah it could be satire it could be you know as it was in the soviet union when there's a dictator
[03:18:46.960 --> 03:18:53.440]   maybe there's an overpowering king you're not allowed to actually speak uh you have to hide the thing
[03:18:53.440 --> 03:19:02.000]   you're you're actually trying to say uh in the subtext so and all of that there was a funny uh maya
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:08.960]   ceramic that had the ceramics are neat because they don't the the the monuments can be kind of broken
[03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:14.880]   records i'm the king i was born this time i beat these people up i married this woman i died but the
[03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:20.560]   ceramics will tell us like things out of mythology stories and there was this one with a rabbit looking
[03:19:20.560 --> 03:19:26.880]   at the merchant god and nobody could translate the text and finally this uh eastern european actually a
[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:36.960]   ukrainian guy translated it and the rabbit saying to uh to the merchant god bend over and smell my ass
[03:19:36.960 --> 03:19:43.760]   it's like oh man we were expecting this wonderful piece of mythology but no it translates bend over and
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:51.600]   smell my ass that's great that's human as we mentioned previously human nature does not change uh you you
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:56.880]   mentioned uh plank and mapping it it's just out of curiosity what is that process like it seems
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:20:04.320]   fascinating oh it was uh it was a great adventure i loved it but it was it was difficult i i woke up
[03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:10.960]   every morning thinking i will be hurt today somehow i don't know how i don't know how badly where on my
[03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:16.320]   body it will occur but it's going to happen because it was the jungle so in the jungle what's what's the
[03:20:16.320 --> 03:20:22.880]   process like what what what do you have to do to map it well it was tricky too because it was also a
[03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:28.480]   a national forest so the forestry department didn't want us to cut down anything more than we had to so
[03:20:28.480 --> 03:20:35.280]   we basically just cut tunnels through the foliage and i would uh we'd map everything twice the first thing
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:42.560]   we do is i'd go in uh find a building draw it on a piece of graph paper and i'd say like you know you
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:48.960]   guys go north you guys go east west find other buildings and when you find them paste back to this
[03:20:48.960 --> 03:20:55.920]   one and so i'd start making a map and i'd make the whole uh one piece of graph paper was enough to then
[03:20:55.920 --> 03:21:01.360]   we'd bring the machine in we'd bring the laser theodolite and get really accurate information but on that
[03:21:01.360 --> 03:21:07.760]   piece of paper i would write like don't bring the machine this way there's a tree fall or stand on top of
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:13.200]   this building and you'll see four different buildings at once from this one nice and all of this is in
[03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:20.080]   dense jungle right and the deeper we got off the road the deeper it was sometimes it would clear out
[03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:28.240]   but certain places if it was low it would be such thick vegetation and it would grow back so fast sometimes
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:36.160]   we would cut just uh uh tunnels through tall grass and we'd come back like five days later
[03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:41.680]   and they were gone yeah like we did we couldn't even find where our trails were they would grow back
[03:21:41.680 --> 03:21:47.440]   that fast but you see the building so you could see right and that was the fun part i mean sometimes
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:51.840]   it would just be like a little neighborhood with little low buildings no bigger than this table but
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:58.800]   sometimes you know just five more meters in and i'm standing under a pyramid that nobody had ever mapped
[03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:04.320]   like wow i've just found another one and some days you know on good days we'd find three pyramids and
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:12.160]   i i i felt uh that's that's such a more exciting job than the typical excavations although my buddies were
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:17.680]   all just you know in a hole for the whole week in the middle of the city and where i'm dancing around
[03:22:17.680 --> 03:22:23.200]   through the jungle i could find you know 10 buildings today i might find a pyramid today who knows what's
[03:22:23.200 --> 03:22:28.880]   that feel like to find like a pyramid or buildings that you're one of the only humans that are not from
[03:22:28.880 --> 03:22:35.680]   that civilization to ever see this thing what's that what's that feel like it's it's great i love that
[03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:42.400]   feeling i i am you know i'm an explorer at heart um so finding something like that you know when i was uh
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:49.680]   when i was 25 years old i i found a whole maya city i got to name it its name is mash nah it's off in
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:57.680]   the belisian jungle and that was just just outrageous i mean it almost dead that one almost depressed me
[03:22:57.680 --> 03:23:06.720]   i was my my entire like i had this great life ambition that i would find a lost city and then i did
[03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:11.920]   it at 25 and i was like god now what do i do i thought that was supposed to take me my whole life
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:17.840]   i actually uh i wrote a bunch of letters to nasa trying to get them to let me be the first uh
[03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:23.680]   archaeologist on mars i never got a single reply back i'm sure i'm on nasa's list as some weirdo
[03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:34.640]   um how'd you find a mayan city i uh i used a topography map of the area and i played the game
[03:23:34.640 --> 03:23:40.640]   if i was a maya where would my favorite place to live in this big area be i i looked for the biggest
[03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:48.640]   mountain because they call all of their pyramids tun wheat stone mountains i knew they loved mountains
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:53.520]   and when i found that mountain there were two others right next to it that made a triangle and they love
[03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:59.680]   those triads and there were rivers in between them and i thought that's it that's where i would build
[03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:05.440]   the city and i hiked out there over two seasons with students the other grad students were like
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:11.920]   he's just having his students just wander in the jungle all day but i came back with the city so
[03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:19.360]   given that you've looked into the deep pasts of uh humanity what gives you hope about our future
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:27.840]   maybe our deep future of this human civilization that's a good one and i do have hope i do have
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:36.720]   hope i i believe in the spirit of humankind i i as a person who have studied history i kind of feel like
[03:24:36.720 --> 03:24:44.160]   history does kind of a sine wave there's highs and there's lows but no matter how low we go we get up
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:53.840]   again and and we climb and i think that humanity will continue that we will rise to the challenges now some of the
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:25:00.400]   challenges may be created by ourselves as well but we will adapt and overcome that's that's what we do
[03:25:00.400 --> 03:25:07.440]   yeah humans find a way right that's that's like uh that's the thing you see with with history you
[03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:15.680]   when the empires collapse they uh the humans that come out of that they pick themselves up and find
[03:25:15.680 --> 03:25:21.120]   another way they build a new thing and the people i study believe in the cyclical nature of life that
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:27.520]   you really can't life can't continue without death being part of the cycle we get our lows we get our
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:35.440]   highs but the cycle continues forever i should mention that you have a lot of great lectures uh on the great
[03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:45.840]   courses but you have also an amazing podcast archaeo ed if people want to listen to it this is a tough
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:55.120]   question but what uh would you recommend what episodes should they listen to what's the oh that is a tough
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:26:01.040]   question what what is uh what is the sampling you know it's like asking a chef like what's the best stuff on the menu
[03:26:03.440 --> 03:26:07.440]   well different strokes for different folks you know i do two different things on that podcast
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:13.280]   sometimes i just teach about cultures that you've never heard about or yeah i i love i i start off by
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:17.440]   saying it's my podcast and i'll talk about whatever the heck i want to talk about sometimes i talk about
[03:26:17.440 --> 03:26:24.800]   really uh specific things like a tool type or an animal type but my favorite ones have become when i just
[03:26:24.800 --> 03:26:32.320]   tell my stories of my adventures i've got a lot of weird adventure stories and uh it's it's been fun and
[03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:36.880]   they've been very well received i've got you know i can put my humor in there and i can talk about
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:42.640]   you know the the things that went right the things that went wrong the adventures that i had are all
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:48.960]   part of part of this archaeo ed thing it's an archaeo ads kind of a double entendre it's me
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:54.960]   i'm just dead but it's also education you know what i'm really trying to do with this too it's
[03:26:54.960 --> 03:27:03.040]   specifically the americas i want to be part of the reawakening that there were these great civilizations
[03:27:03.040 --> 03:27:10.960]   here especially north america i i think that we have a group amnesia that there was no great civilizations
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:18.560]   here before europe showed up that's simply not true i think it should be part of our history books in fact i
[03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:26.720]   have a program called before the americas that uh would introduce as part of american history
[03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:33.600]   the part before european contact and i think that kids in the k-12 level should grow up
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:44.400]   not being told this fallacy that no one was here before we showed up in 1492 and one of these days i'm going to find a funder to
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:52.480]   help us put together before the americas and we're going to make it part of the curriculum for every kid in the u.s to
[03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:59.360]   know the full history of this country that's a great project ed thank you so much thank you for talking today

[03:28:19.440 --> 03:28:28.720]   words from joseph campbell life is but a mask worn on the face of death and is death then but another
[03:28:28.720 --> 03:28:39.440]   mask how many can say asks the aztec poet that there is or is not a truth beyond thank you for listening
