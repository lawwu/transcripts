[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host,
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.820]   and today we continue our series
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.680]   on how to invest in your children at an early age
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.980]   so you won't be paying for them for the rest of your life.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.120]   And I think today's topic is especially pertinent
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.260]   to this basic idea.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.400]   My idea in this series is to give you
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.760]   all of the best ideas that you can use
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.900]   to invest into your children early
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.340]   so that they won't require economic outpatient care,
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.900]   as the late Thomas Stanley,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.440]   author of "The Millionaire Next Door" used to term it.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.780]   Economic outpatient care is when a parent,
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.140]   especially a wealthy parent,
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140]   finds himself continually supporting his children
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.420]   long past their childhood, far into young adulthood,
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.360]   and even adulthood in some cases.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.660]   And if you are required to do that,
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.100]   it can be a very expensive proposition.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.520]   It's nice to do it if you want to,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.200]   if you desire to support your children,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.600]   that's a great blessing,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.040]   but to need to do that is a big problem,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.400]   and it can be a very expensive investment.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.440]   And what I'm hoping to do is to persuade you
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.880]   to agree with me that if you do certain things effectively
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.820]   at a young age, then you dramatically minimize the need
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.620]   for you to pay lots of money
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.420]   for your children's college education,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.420]   you diminish the need for you to pay lots of money
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.960]   for economic outpatient care
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.220]   in their 20s and their 30s, et cetera,
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.900]   and that's what we're all about.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.700]   So we started with talking about the body,
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.500]   how to invest into the body of your children,
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.260]   and we've spent quite a lot of time dealing with the minds,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.400]   how to invest in the minds of your children.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.900]   And you can consider this episode a hinge episode
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.840]   as we pivot to the third category
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.520]   of investing into the spirit of your children.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.640]   Now I'm gonna use that term very loosely.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.080]   What I'm trying to get at in the distinction
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.380]   between mind and spirit or mind and character
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.000]   or mind and person is the difference
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.220]   between the physical brain and its exercise
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.700]   versus the emotional self, the real self, the id,
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.100]   the spiritual being that goes beyond
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.700]   the simple physical gray matter of your child.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.780]   You'll notice that when I spoke about the body,
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.440]   I talked about lots and lots of physical aspects
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.040]   of the being.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   I talked about the importance of exercise
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.020]   and of building balance and coordination
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.220]   and good nutrition.
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.460]   As I've talked about the brain,
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.480]   I've been focusing on mostly things
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.620]   that have good evidence.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.780]   Let me be careful not to say proven,
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.860]   but have good evidence to indicate
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.500]   that they literally make your children smarter,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.420]   things that grow the gray matter,
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.540]   grow the number of connections between the neurons
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.040]   and the brains of your children.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.220]   And that's been the theme of this whole section.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.620]   Well, now we're pivoting to things
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.100]   that may or may not necessarily make your children
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.320]   smarter on a physical level,
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.940]   but these things definitely make your children smarter
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.660]   on a practical level.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.380]   They make your children more capable
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.300]   'cause we're starting to move into the emotions.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.020]   And I consider today's topic,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.380]   the importance of discussing or teaching your children
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.380]   logic and philosophy to be an important hinge
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.480]   kind of between them.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.900]   Because if your children understand logic,
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.580]   they understand and are conversant in the laws of logic,
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.340]   how logical thinking works,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.620]   they'll be able to coach themselves in many cases.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.080]   They'll be able to look out for themselves.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.720]   They'll be able to avoid scams.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.960]   They'll be able to avoid emotional manipulation.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.940]   They'll be able to simply be good coaches for themselves
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.180]   because they can think.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.860]   And if we put this together with all the previous skills,
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.760]   then they will have what they need
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.860]   to be logical, rational creatures.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.360]   We'll talk more about philosophy
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.940]   in the back half of this show.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.020]   So logic, is this something that we can and should teach?
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.740]   My answer is simply yes.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.820]   Ideally, every school would have years of study of logic.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.460]   Unfortunately, it's a subject
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.180]   that is not given as much attention
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.480]   as I think it really should be.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.720]   In some cases, I think this is coming back.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.100]   Logic is a core part of the classic,
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.820]   the idea of classical education.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.180]   And there's been a resurgence in classical education
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.080]   over previous years.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.860]   And so we see more and more discussion of logic
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.480]   and more and more teaching of logic.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.860]   But regardless of what your child's school does
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.280]   or does not teach, you as a parent have a responsibility
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.100]   to teach your child logical thinking,
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.060]   logical analysis, and the tools of logic.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.760]   I want to start with a short apologetic
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.300]   for the teaching of logic.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.400]   And to do so, I'm gonna read a couple of passages
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.420]   from a book that I referenced previously in this series.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.100]   The book is entitled, "Teaching the Trivium,
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.240]   "Christian Homeschooling in a Classical Style"
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.620]   by Harvey and Lori Bludorn.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.220]   And they have a chapter in this book called,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.420]   "Teaching Logic" that I think does a pretty good job
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.420]   and is quite a concise discussion of why teach logic.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.980]   An argument for teaching logic.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.540]   The second part of the trivium is logic.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.660]   Every subject has its own logic,
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.660]   the proper order and relationship between all of the parts.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.100]   Logic is the way things fit together,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.580]   or at least the way they ought to fit together.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.820]   We want to describe the subject, which we call logic,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.420]   because all of our understanding of every other subject
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.300]   is built upon the framework of this thing we call logic.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.320]   What is logic?
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.780]   Logic is the simplest and most elementary
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.320]   of all exact sciences.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.720]   It is the science of correct reasoning.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.020]   Every science is occupied with detecting
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.420]   and describing the necessary and unalterable laws
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.180]   which rule a particular field of knowledge.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.900]   Considered as a science, logic detects
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.580]   and describes the necessary and unalterable laws
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.700]   of correct reasoning.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.260]   The apparatus which reasons or performs logic is the mind.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.880]   Logic is in a limited sense, a science of the mind.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.540]   To the extent an individual is incapable
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.180]   of logical analysis and conclusion,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.420]   he is to the same extent mindless.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.420]   That is, he does not use the powers of his mind.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.820]   Dropping down a bit, man's mind is not blank at birth.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.700]   Well before we are born,
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.360]   while we are still in our mother's womb,
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.500]   God gives us minds which have the power
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.900]   to evaluate all of our sensory experiences
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.580]   according to a systematic logic,
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.940]   which has already been structured
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.500]   and programmed into our minds by God.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   This natural logic is thus an inborn faculty
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.460]   for reasoned judgment and inference.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.620]   But like any other native faculty,
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.300]   its capacity may be developed through use,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.940]   its power strengthened through training,
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.340]   and its precision fine-tuned through testing.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.700]   As infants, when we began to learn the language,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.500]   we assigned meanings to words
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.780]   according to our logical analysis
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.500]   of how we observed those words being used in sentences.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.080]   So let us talk about words and sentences for a moment.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.340]   Standing all by themselves, words have meaning.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.660]   For example, here is a word, horse.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.940]   It has more meaning within a sentence.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.500]   Here is that word used in sentences.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.660]   I would love to ride a Palomino horse.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.220]   I enjoy watching a Clydesdale horse work.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.540]   However, when words are illogically combined in a sentence,
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.860]   they become meaningless.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.260]   For example, consider this sentence.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.060]   Draw a square circle.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.180]   The sentence is grammatically correct.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.260]   Standing by themselves,
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.620]   the two words square and circle make sense.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.620]   But when these two words are combined
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.460]   as they are in this sentence, they make no sense.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.200]   The sentence is nonsense.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.820]   By definition, something circular cannot also be square.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.200]   We call this an oxymoron or a contradiction in terms.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.940]   Sometimes we are confronted by a contradiction in terms,
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.500]   but we do not recognize it.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.020]   For example, someone might ask,
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.360]   "Can God make a stone too heavy for himself to lift?"
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.100]   The idea is absurd.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.180]   We might as well ask God
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.100]   to make a God greater than himself,
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.300]   such that he must bow before that God which he had made.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.820]   It is not possible in the very nature of things.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.620]   Yet we are surrounded by attempts
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.380]   to impose such absurdities upon us.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.100]   Feminism, homosexuality, multiculturalism,
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.180]   such ideas are logical absurdities,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.720]   contradictions in terms,
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.020]   which we are expected to absorb into our thinking.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.480]   Feminism, making women to be men would be masculinism.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.660]   Homosexual, sex means they're different, not the same.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.860]   Multiculturalism, many cultures may be in contact
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.620]   with each other and affect each other,
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.220]   but they cannot inhabit the same population.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.980]   Something must give.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.060]   Such ideas cloud our minds in order to corrupt our thinking
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.900]   and to lead us into a whole world of absurdities.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.860]   Our culture is being filled
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.740]   with these absurdities of language.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.460]   For example, consider the man who thought he could fly.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.280]   So he jumped off of the top of the Sears Tower.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.300]   Sure enough, he was flying.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.220]   As he passed each story on his way down,
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.260]   he cried to those who were looking through the windows,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.200]   "So far, so good, so far, so good."
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.540]   Everything seemed to be going just fine.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   He was even gaining speed as he flew.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.580]   He had proven that he could fly.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.020]   But as he approached the pavement below,
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.320]   he suddenly realized that he had overlooked the question
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.260]   of whether he could land.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.860]   What was the man's problem?
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.220]   He knew the meaning of fly,
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.560]   and he knew the meaning of man,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.360]   but he made a connection between them,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.100]   which was contrary to the nature of things.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.320]   But that was not nearly so bad
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.680]   as when he tried to put this connection into practice.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.120]   The law of gravity seemed to play on his side for a while.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.040]   But once he encountered the pavement below,
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.600]   the law of mass inertia was enforced.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.520]   He suddenly had a concrete understanding of the matter.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.140]   Feminism, homosexuality, multiculturalism, ad nauseum
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.080]   may seem to fly, so far, so good.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.840]   And some things may seem to play on their side,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.320]   but eventually they will be arrested by the laws of nature
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.900]   and of nature's God, the creator,
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.480]   to whom they must inevitably give an account.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.040]   They are absurdities,
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.460]   which contradict the logic of reality.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.000]   So words may have meaning,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.360]   but truth is not in the meaning of words.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.400]   Truth is in the meaning of sentences.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.360]   A logician would say it this way.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.440]   Truth is not in terms, truth is in propositions.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.320]   A word or a term by itself is neither true nor false.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.560]   For example, the word broccoli has meaning,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.840]   but by itself it is neither true nor false.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.040]   However, a sentence or a proposition about broccoli,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   such as broccoli is edible, is either true or false.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.580]   We each have our own opinion
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.760]   about that proposition, don't we?
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.480]   Truth is not in words or terms,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.800]   but in sentences or propositions,
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.540]   which say something about those terms.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.040]   Why is it important to study logic?
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   Let us consider the most basic law of logic,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.520]   called the law of contradiction.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   Some prefer to call it the law of non-contradiction.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.960]   Aristotle expressed it in this manner.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.540]   The same attribute cannot at the same time
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.880]   both belong and not belong to the same subject
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.600]   and in the same respect.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.800]   Philosophers always speak in such plain language,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.780]   don't they?
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.320]   Perhaps we can make it more plain
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.440]   with a simple illustration.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.140]   A candle may be both lit and not lit,
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.720]   but not at the same time, nor in the same respect.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   It may be lit in the nighttime,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.600]   but not lit in the daytime.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.680]   Or it may be lit on one end,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.500]   but not lit on the other end.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.120]   Or it may be lit on both ends,
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.880]   but not lit in the middle.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.340]   But wherever it may be lit or not lit,
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.600]   it cannot be both lit and not lit
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.180]   on the same end at the same time,
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.580]   because that would be a what?
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.560]   A contradiction.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.300]   A dove cannot have all white feathers
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.780]   and all black feathers at the same time.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.380]   A person cannot be both completely dead
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.740]   and totally alive at the same time,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.060]   or at least not in the same respect.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.100]   Without this law of non-contradiction,
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.560]   words or terms would no longer have specific meaning.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.740]   If an attribute may at the same time
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.320]   both belong and not belong to the same word
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.200]   and in the same respect,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.500]   then that word may be twisted to mean anything.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.440]   We may trust politicians to supply us
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.160]   with ample examples of this phenomena.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   For example, a budget surplus
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.120]   is really a reduction of the rate of deficit spending.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.900]   If we disregard this basic rule of logic,
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.080]   that a word cannot have contradictory meanings
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.240]   at the same time,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.980]   then the distinctions between black and white,
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.480]   right and wrong, good and evil,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.800]   is and is not will slowly grow fuzzy
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.100]   and may eventually dissolve completely.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.400]   Where there is no logic,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.980]   there can be no absolute standards,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.840]   but only relative personal values.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.480]   If truth becomes relative in our thinking,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.880]   then it follows that morality
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.140]   must also become relative in our thinking.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.960]   Dropping down a bit.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.400]   In our culture, we have now arrived
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.860]   at the philosophy of polylogism, many logics.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.820]   We are told that there is no such thing as absolute truth.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.740]   All truth is relative.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.300]   There is no single logic.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.620]   There are many different logics
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.100]   and all of them are equally valid.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.100]   This of course means that no logic is actually valid.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.180]   Apparent contradictions among the different logics
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.100]   must be resolved, so they say,
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.620]   by some force other than reason,
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.020]   because reason itself is the cause of the contradictions.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.500]   We shall all be like gods,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.760]   deciding for ourselves individually or collectively
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.800]   what is good and what is evil.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.660]   Later.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.140]   This polylogism is the kind of absurd nonsense
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.700]   which is being taught in government schools today.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.580]   Though this was once largely confined to the university,
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.180]   now elementary schools are being filled with this nonsense.
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.940]   Polylogism forms the foundation of modern thinking.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.820]   With polylogism, absolute truth is absolutely ruled out.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.520]   The only way to establish any truth is to decree it.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.240]   Truth is whatever we decide it to be.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   What we want to be true is our standard for what is true.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.500]   If it fits with our preferences,
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.900]   then we say, let it be so, and it is so.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.080]   Dropping down, we have a section,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.120]   what is logic useful for?
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.100]   Logic is useful to understand the sciences.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.180]   Every science, whether it be chemistry,
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.340]   physics, geography, history, or theology,
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.820]   is, or at least it should be,
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.860]   the application of the science of logic
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.780]   to observations made in that particular field of knowledge.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.220]   Hence, the study of the exact science of logic
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.820]   is foundational to the study of every other subject.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.620]   The ancients called logic the organon,
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.460]   the instrument presupposed by every other science.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.660]   The formal study of logic should therefore be considered
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.940]   a foundational and indispensable part
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.180]   of every educational curriculum,
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.100]   and in the past, it was.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.820]   Logic is useful to discern the truth.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.440]   In the past, logic was the first course required
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.980]   of all college freshmen.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.980]   Why?
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.200]   Because logic is the means for getting at the truth
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.220]   of propositions, the soundness of arguments,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.800]   and the possibility or plausibility of assertions.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.780]   Later, logic is useful
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.540]   in the proper development of the brain.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.100]   Our brain can be compared to a muscle in this respect.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.660]   No pain, no gain.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.020]   A certain radio commentator
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.060]   likes to describe school-age children's brains
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.940]   as skulls full of mush.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.980]   We presume he is pointing
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.620]   to their lack of intellectual development
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.260]   due to their improper diet, input of knowledge,
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.220]   lack of exercise, processing of understanding,
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.020]   and extracurricular activity, output of wisdom.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.320]   Of course, the mind must have something good to chew on,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.900]   and it must have a reason to be chewing.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.900]   But right now, we're only talking about the chewing itself,
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.220]   the logic.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.100]   Whenever we interrupt
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.120]   the natural trivium progression of learning,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.740]   leaving out one of the steps,
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.100]   we create a learning dysfunction.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.740]   This is the age of learning dysfunctions.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.940]   This is the age of interruptions.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.580]   For example, when we omit teaching
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.960]   the basic principles of phonics,
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.480]   then we interrupt the natural development
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.180]   of written phonetic language learning,
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.500]   and we thereby create the learning dysfunction,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.860]   which we call dyslexia, the inability to read.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.560]   Well, if we omit teaching the basic principles of logic,
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.020]   then we will create the dysfunction,
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.100]   which we might call dyslogia, the inability to think.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.020]   Put dyslexia and dyslogia together,
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.640]   and what do you have?
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.940]   Disaster.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.100]   Logic is thoroughly dispensed with in modern curricula,
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.700]   except as a tool for manipulation.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.780]   Nebulous social skills are considered more important
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.060]   than precise thinking skills.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.140]   Feeling is valued more than discernment.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.460]   And where some kind of thinking is taught,
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.180]   it is a programmed thinking,
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.900]   not a genuine critical thinking.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.260]   The child is trained to think with the herd, like an animal,
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.340]   then socialized to run with the animals in the herd.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.380]   Beware of stampedes, known today as group consensus.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.100]   Thou shalt not follow a mindless multitude to do evil.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.220]   Exodus 23.2.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.860]   The child is programmed not to question certain concepts,
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.580]   precisely because they are not provable.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.180]   They have been handed down from the politically correct gods
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.860]   by infallible revelation,
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.260]   and none may dare to deeply explore their reasoning.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.460]   It is through some form of logical study
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.220]   that we become skilled to discern between truth and error,
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.140]   and therefore between good and evil, and right and wrong.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.380]   Now the authors go on to give a discussion
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.980]   of what is logic, defining and describing it,
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.780]   discussing the various forms of logic,
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.300]   how to study logic, et cetera.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.420]   But if you're interested in that,
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.980]   you can search out those resources.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.500]   Obviously, the authors are providing
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.420]   quite a biting social commentary.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.420]   That book was written, I think, 20 years ago.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.900]   And what's interesting is if we trace back the last 20 years,
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.860]   I think the authors are proven more right than less right.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.860]   Copyright 2001, so 22 years ago.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.660]   And I used to read those books when I was younger,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.900]   and I'd say, "Ah, you're going too far.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.980]   "You're just a whadduckle old religious fundamentalist,
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.380]   "and what's wrong with you?"
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.460]   But tell you what,
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.100]   a lot of those old religious fundamentalists
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.740]   have been proven to be much more right than wrong
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.140]   in many of the arguments that they made.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.820]   And to me, what is most important
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.260]   is that last little commentary,
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.380]   that we need to teach our children to think critically,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.740]   actually to think critically,
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.540]   and not to be trained to think with the herd.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.180]   And this is exceedingly important
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.740]   in order that our children can obtain for themselves
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.820]   unusual benefits in life.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.380]   One of the, years ago,
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.540]   I made a study of John Taylor Gatto's works.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.780]   He of the well-known
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.420]   "Underground History of American Education,"
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.940]   probably his best-known book, was dumbing us down.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.940]   And my personal summary of his lifetimes of work
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.180]   is quite simply that school was developed
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.460]   for two basic purposes.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.420]   To create a homogenous society for easy governance
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.060]   by the powers that be,
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.340]   and for easy selling to by the corporate powers that be.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.940]   If you have a homogenous population,
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.460]   then it's easy to govern those people.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.380]   And if you have a homogenous population,
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.500]   it's easy to market and sell to those people
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.780]   to use propaganda.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.300]   I personally intend that
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.460]   during my children's schooling curriculum,
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.020]   they'll study the use of propaganda.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.260]   We'll start with Edward Bernays' book,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.860]   "Propaganda," kind of the father of modern propaganda,
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.900]   and look at it deeply.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.900]   Because when you understand logic,
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.100]   and you understand propaganda,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.420]   and you understand how people have been conditioned
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.420]   through social conditioning to go along with everyone else,
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.220]   it's remarkable.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.380]   And all of us are affected by it.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.700]   All of us are.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.300]   I have, at various times in my adult life,
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.300]   been scandalized at how much I personally
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.500]   am affected by going along with the herd
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.580]   in many various ways.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.900]   And I pride myself on doing my best
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.980]   to be a critical thinker,
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.420]   trying to be willing to follow my understanding
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.900]   of the world, regardless of anyone goes with me or not.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.900]   And yet constantly, I've been conditioned
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.820]   to fit in with the herd.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.620]   And this is to our detriment.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.620]   Left unchecked, this leads to horrific error in populations.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.020]   And we can look throughout history,
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.980]   and we can find example after example after example,
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.020]   showing that to be true.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.460]   So how do we combat that?
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.740]   Well, we study logic, and we study philosophy,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.740]   and all of their basic practices.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.020]   We exercise our skills of reason,
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.860]   discernment, and critical thinking.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.540]   And we do that through the study of logic and philosophy.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.820]   That's my answer.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.660]   And we teach through the use of logic and philosophy.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.940]   We teach people to disassociate from an idea,
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.060]   and examine the idea on its own merits.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.860]   And that is a skill that is greatly lacking
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.060]   among our friends.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.180]   We desperately need more of that in our society.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.980]   By teaching your children logic and philosophy,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.140]   by teaching them about propaganda,
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.260]   about emotional manipulation,
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260]   they will have a defense mechanism
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.140]   that they can use when somebody tries to market
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.540]   a product to them that is not a good fit for them.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.780]   When somebody tries to market a lifestyle to them
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.260]   that is not of their choosing,
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.500]   they'll have a tool set that they can use
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.100]   to examine their own decisions,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.660]   and the outcomes of all of their own decisions.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.620]   And that's why it's desperately important
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.100]   that we teach our children logic.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:13.940]   How do we do that?
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.860]   Well, we begin with a class, a textbook,
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.300]   some books to start with.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.020]   I think there are a couple of books.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.220]   I am not yet at the point
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.260]   where I'm formally teaching logic,
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.700]   but the books are some books that I intend to use
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.020]   when I get to that point.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.860]   A couple of popular level books
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.620]   that I think are worth considering.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.220]   There's a book called "The Fallacy Detective"
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.780]   by Nathaniel Bluedorn and Hans Bluedorn.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.900]   These are the sons of the authors of this book,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.100]   "Teaching the Trivium" that I've just read to you from.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.300]   I think that's a good start.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.020]   I've become a big fan of "The Life of Fred" books
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.900]   by Stanley Schmidt.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.220]   I have ordered his book on logic,
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.460]   and I expect to like it as much as I've liked
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.220]   all of his other math books.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.780]   But I haven't gotten it in yet,
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.340]   so I look forward to using that one.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.540]   I think those are good.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.060]   Those two books are probably good entry-level books
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.940]   to begin with.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.820]   And then I intend to supplement that
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.220]   with a scholarly-level textbook
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.740]   to make sure we have a good grounding
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.980]   in the academic approach as well.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.980]   But I think those two books are good resources
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.620]   for people to begin with.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.780]   Now let's turn our attention to a related field,
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.460]   and that is the field of philosophy.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.620]   And the text that I've chosen
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.260]   to introduce a few of these comments
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:26.580]   comes from the excellent book, "How to Read a Book."
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.700]   The title is "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.780]   Mortimer Adler, longtime scholar,
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.260]   publisher of the great books series
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.900]   for the Encyclopedia Britannica, et cetera.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.620]   Amazing scholar, very, very useful guy.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.100]   And his book that he's most well-known for, of course,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.700]   is this book called "How to Read a Book."
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.260]   And when I read this years ago,
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.220]   his chapter on philosophy struck me on a very deep level.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.580]   And because it made philosophy make sense
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.680]   and it ignited in me a desire to study philosophy.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.700]   And so I want to share a few pages with you.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.900]   "How to Read Philosophy."
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.060]   "Children ask magnificent questions.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.820]   'Why are people?'
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.740]   'What makes the cat tick?'
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.820]   'What's the world's first name?'
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.860]   'Did God have a reason for creating the earth?'
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.620]   Out of the mouths of babes comes, if not wisdom,
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.940]   at least the search for it."
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.220]   Philosophy, according to Aristotle, begins in wonder.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.140]   It certainly begins in childhood,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.700]   even if for most of us, it stops there too.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.540]   The child is a natural questioner.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.660]   It is not the number of questions he asks,
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.740]   but their character that distinguishes him from the adult.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.020]   Adults do not lose the curiosity
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.580]   that seems to be a native human trait,
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.960]   but their curiosity deteriorates in quality.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.460]   They want to know whether something is so, not why.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.180]   But children's questions are not limited
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.300]   to the sort that can be answered by an encyclopedia.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.500]   What happens between the nursery and college
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.900]   to turn the flow of questions off?
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.660]   Or rather, to turn it into the duller channels
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.660]   of adult curiosity about matters of fact?
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.140]   A mind not agitated by good questions
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.720]   cannot appreciate the significance
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.620]   of even the best answers.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.020]   It is easy enough to learn the answers,
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.920]   but to develop actively inquisitive minds,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.460]   alive with real questions, profound questions,
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.840]   that is another story.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.420]   Why should we have to try to develop such minds
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.860]   when children are born with them?
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.140]   Somewhere along the line, adults must fail somehow
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.100]   to sustain the infant's curiosity at its original depth.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.800]   School itself perhaps dulls the mind
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.680]   by the dead weight of rote learning,
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.880]   much of which may be necessary.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.740]   The failure is probably even more the parent's fault.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.180]   We so often tell a child there is no answer,
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.080]   even when one is available,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.440]   or demand that he ask no more questions.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.700]   We thinly conceal our irritation
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.060]   when baffled by the apparently unanswerable query.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.260]   All this discourages the child.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.300]   He may get the impression
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.940]   that it is impolite to be too inquisitive.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.620]   Human inquisitiveness is never killed,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.500]   but it is soon debased to the sort of questions
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.580]   asked by most college students,
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.140]   who, like the adults they are soon to become,
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.860]   ask only for information.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.860]   We have no solution for this problem.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.300]   We are certainly not so brash
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.160]   as to think we can tell you how to answer
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.940]   the profound and wondrous questions that children put.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.560]   But we do want you to recognize
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.980]   that one of the most remarkable things
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.260]   about the great philosophical books
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.540]   is that they ask the same sort of profound questions
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.060]   that children ask.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.020]   The ability to retain the child's view of the world
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.460]   with, at the same time, a mature understanding
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.980]   of what it means to retain it is extremely rare.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.860]   And a person who has these qualities
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.260]   is likely to be able to contribute
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.580]   something really important to our thinking.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.740]   We are not required to think as children
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.980]   in order to understand existence.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.220]   Children certainly do not and cannot understand it,
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.000]   if indeed anyone can.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.580]   But we must be able to see as children see,
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.920]   to wonder as they wonder, to ask as they ask.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.480]   The complexities of adult life get in the way of the truth.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.500]   The great philosophers have always been able
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.540]   to clear away the complexities and see simple distinctions,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.620]   simple once they are stated, vastly difficult before.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.740]   If we are to follow them,
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.380]   we too must be childishly simple in our questions
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.360]   and maturely wise in our replies.

[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.460]   The questions philosophers ask.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.900]   What are these childishly simple questions
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.500]   that philosophers ask?
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.120]   When we write them down, they do not seem simple
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.500]   because to answer them is so difficult.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.540]   Nevertheless, they are initially simple
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.980]   in the sense of being basic or fundamental.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.300]   Take the following questions about being or existence,
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.640]   for example.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   What is the difference between existing and not existing?
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.660]   What is common to all the things that do exist?
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.140]   And what are the properties of everything
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.420]   that does exist?
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.900]   Are there different ways in which things can exist?
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.320]   Different modes of being or existence?
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.580]   Do some things exist only in the mind or for the mind,
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.380]   whereas others exist outside the mind
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.660]   and whether or not they are known to us
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.740]   or even knowable by us?
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.980]   Does everything that exists, exist physically?
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.860]   Or are there some things that exist
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.580]   apart from material embodiment?
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.220]   Do all things change?
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.180]   Or is there anything that is immutable?
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.700]   Does anything exist necessarily?
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.100]   Or must we say that everything that does exist
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.500]   might not have existed?
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.720]   Is the realm of possible existence larger
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.860]   than the realm of what actually does exist?
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.760]   These are typically the kind of questions
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.420]   that a philosopher asks when he is concerned
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.020]   to explore the nature of being itself
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.100]   and the realms of being.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.580]   As questions, they are not difficult to state or understand,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.500]   but they are enormously difficult to answer.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.740]   So difficult in fact, that there are philosophers,
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.380]   especially in recent times,
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.220]   who have held that they cannot be answered
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.620]   in any satisfactory manner.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.780]   Another set of philosophical questions concerns
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.100]   change or becoming rather than being.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.480]   Of the things in our experience
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.680]   to which we would unhesitatingly attribute existence,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.000]   we would also say that all of them are subject to change.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.620]   They come into being and pass away.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.500]   While in being, most of them move
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.860]   from one place to another,
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.180]   and many of them change in quantity or in quality.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.780]   They become larger or smaller, heavier or lighter,
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.600]   or like the ripening apple and the aging beefsteak,
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.780]   they change in color.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.260]   What is involved in any change?
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.660]   In every process of change,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.340]   is there something that endures unchanged
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.520]   as well as some respect or aspect
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.300]   of that enduring thing which undergoes change?
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.640]   When you learn something that you did not know before,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.540]   you have certainly changed with respect
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.140]   to the knowledge you have acquired,
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.300]   but you are also the same individual that you were before.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.400]   If that were not the case,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.260]   you could not be said to have changed through learning.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.940]   Is this true of all change?
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.280]   For example, is it true of such remarkable changes
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.700]   as birth and death,
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.500]   of coming to be and passing away,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.540]   or only of less fundamental changes,
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.140]   such as local motion, growth, or alteration in quality?
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.780]   How many different kinds of change are there?
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.940]   Do the same fundamental elements or conditions
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.220]   enter into all processes of change,
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.480]   and are the same causes operative in all?
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.220]   What do we mean by a cause of change?
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.640]   Are there different types of causes
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.160]   responsible for a change?
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.660]   Are the causes of change, of becoming,
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.640]   the same as the causes of being or existence?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.540]   Such questions are asked by the philosopher
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.900]   who turns his attention from being to becoming,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.820]   and also tries to relate becoming to being.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.600]   Once again, they are not difficult questions
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.940]   to state or understand,
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.500]   though they are extremely difficult
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.900]   to answer clearly and well.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.720]   In any case, you can see how they begin
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.640]   with a childishly simple attitude toward the world
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.260]   and our experience of it.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.960]   Unfortunately, we do not have space
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.500]   to go into the whole range of questions more deeply.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.140]   We can only list some other questions
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.740]   that philosophers ask and try to answer.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.860]   There are questions not only about being
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.900]   and becoming, but also about necessity and contingency,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.540]   about the material and the immaterial,
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.740]   about the physical and the non-physical,
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.460]   about freedom and indeterminacy,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.380]   about the powers of the human mind,
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.660]   about the nature and extent of human knowledge,
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.900]   about the freedom of the will.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.660]   All these questions are speculative or theoretical
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.540]   in the sense of those terms that we have employed
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.340]   in distinguishing between the theoretical
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.040]   and practical realms.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.740]   But philosophy, as you know,
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.060]   is not restricted to theoretical questions only.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.540]   Take good and evil, for instance.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.240]   Children are much concerned with the difference
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.260]   between good and bad.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.660]   Their behinds are likely to suffer
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.240]   if they make mistakes about it.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.420]   But we do not stop wondering about the difference
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.700]   when we grow up.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.300]   Is there a universally valid distinction
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.620]   between good and evil?
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.180]   Are there certain things that are always good,
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.500]   others that are always bad, whatever the circumstances?
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.660]   Or was Hamlet right when, echoing Montaigne,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.220]   he said, "There is nothing either good or bad,
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.100]   "but thinking makes it so."
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.340]   Good and evil, of course,
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.940]   are not the same as right and wrong.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.140]   The two pairs of terms seem to refer
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.180]   to different classes of things.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.580]   In particular, even if we feel
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.700]   that whatever is right is good,
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.500]   we probably do not feel that whatever is wrong is evil.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.540]   But how do we make this distinction precise?
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.140]   Good is an important philosophical word,
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.600]   but it is an important word
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.780]   in our everyday vocabulary too.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.260]   Trying to say what it means is a heady exercise.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.620]   It will involve you very deeply in philosophy
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.100]   before you know it.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.880]   There are many things that are good,
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.340]   or as we would prefer to say, there are many goods.
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.700]   Is it possible to order the goods?
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.380]   Are some more important than others?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.380]   Do some depend on others?
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.820]   Are there circumstances in which goods conflict
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.460]   so that you have to choose one good
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.880]   at the expense of foregoing another?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.020]   Again, we do not have space
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.320]   to go more extensively into these questions.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.440]   We can only list some other questions in the practical realm.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.680]   There are questions not only about good and evil,
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.720]   right and wrong, and the order of goods,
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.940]   but also about duties and obligations,
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.900]   about virtues and vices, about happiness,
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.080]   life's purpose or goal, about justice and rights
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.920]   in the sphere of human relations and social interaction,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.680]   about the state and its relation to the individual,
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.640]   about the good society, the just polity,
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.520]   and the just economy, about war and peace.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.440]   The two groups of questions that we have discussed
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.080]   determine or identify two main divisions of philosophy.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.680]   The questions in the first group,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.140]   the questions about being and becoming,
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.920]   have to do with what is or happens in the world.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.340]   Such questions belong to the division of philosophy
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.960]   that is called theoretical or speculative.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.480]   The questions in the second group,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.520]   the questions concerning good and evil,
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.800]   or right and wrong, have to do with
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.120]   what ought to be done or sought,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.960]   and they belong to the division of philosophy
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.000]   that is sometimes called practical,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.600]   and is more accurately called normative.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.720]   Books that tell you how to make something,
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.320]   such as a cookbook, or how to do something,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.160]   such as a driver's manual, need not try to argue
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.320]   that you ought to become a good cook
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.240]   or learn to drive a car well.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.520]   They can assume that you want to make or do something
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.200]   and merely tell you how to succeed in your efforts.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.480]   In contrast, books of normative philosophy
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.720]   concern themselves primarily with the goals
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   all men ought to seek, goals such as leading a good life
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.800]   or instituting a good society.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.000]   And unlike cookbooks and driving manuals,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.680]   they go no further than prescribing
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.300]   in the most universal terms,
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.340]   the means that ought to be employed
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.600]   in order to achieve these goals.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.120]   The questions that philosophers ask
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.640]   also serve to distinguish subordinate branches
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.940]   of the two main divisions of philosophy.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.140]   A work of speculative or theoretical philosophy
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.880]   is metaphysical if it is mainly concerned
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.100]   with questions about being or existence.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.360]   It is a work in the philosophy of nature
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.560]   if it is concerned with becoming,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.880]   with the nature and kinds of changes,
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.760]   their conditions and causes.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.160]   If its primary concern is with knowledge,
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.920]   with questions about what is involved
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.160]   in our knowing anything, with the causes,
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   extent, and limits of human knowledge,
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.480]   and with its certainties and uncertainties,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.040]   then it is a work in epistemology,
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.880]   which is just another name for theory of knowledge.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.980]   Turning from theoretical to normative philosophy,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.800]   the main distinction is between questions
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.580]   about the good life and what is right or wrong
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.320]   in the conduct of the individual,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.980]   all of which fall within the sphere of ethics
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.820]   and questions about the good society
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.420]   and the conduct of the individual
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.000]   in relation to the community,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.040]   the sphere of politics or political philosophy.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.840]   Modern philosophy and the great tradition.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.580]   For the sake of brevity in what follows,
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.800]   let us call questions about what is and happens in the world
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.600]   or about what men ought to do
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.200]   or seek first order questions.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.680]   We should recognize then
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.920]   that there are also second order questions
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.220]   that can be asked,
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.120]   questions about our first order knowledge,
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.420]   questions about the content of our thinking
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.840]   when we try to answer first order questions,
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.160]   questions about the ways
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.360]   in which we express such thoughts in language.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.520]   This distinction between first order
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.720]   and second order questions is useful
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.020]   because it helps to explain
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.960]   what has happened to philosophy in recent years.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.780]   The majority of professional philosophers
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.820]   at the present day,
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.000]   and by the way, this was 1950s, I think,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.780]   the majority of professional philosophers
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.420]   at the present day no longer believe
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.900]   that first order questions can be answered by philosophers.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.740]   Most professional philosophers today
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.300]   devote their attention exclusively
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.860]   to second order questions,
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.260]   very often to questions having to do with the language
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.120]   in which thought is expressed.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.180]   That is all to the good
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.260]   for it is never harmful to be critical.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.940]   The trouble is the wholesale giving up
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.220]   of first order philosophical questions,
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.060]   which are the ones that are most likely
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.460]   to interest lay readers.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.780]   In fact, philosophy today,
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.740]   like contemporary science or mathematics
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.500]   is no longer being written for lay readers.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.260]   Second order questions are almost by definition,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.260]   ones of narrow appeal.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.940]   And professional philosophers like scientists
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.700]   are not interested in the views of anyone,
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.460]   but other experts.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.860]   This makes modern philosophy very hard to read
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.340]   for non philosophers.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.820]   As difficult indeed as science for non scientists.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.140]   We cannot in this book give you any advice
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.740]   about how to read modern philosophy
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.660]   as long as it is concerned exclusively
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.380]   with second order questions.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.580]   However, there are philosophical books that you can read
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.100]   and that we believe you should read.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.060]   These books ask the kinds of questions
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.400]   that we have called first order ones.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.460]   It is not accidental that they were also written primarily
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.820]   for a lay audience rather than exclusively
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.700]   for other philosophers.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.060]   Up to about 1930, or perhaps even a little later,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.920]   philosophical books were written for the general reader.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.260]   Philosophers hoped to be read by their peers,
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.380]   but they also wanted to be read by ordinary,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.380]   intelligent men and women.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.920]   Since the questions that they asked and tried to answer
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.640]   were of concern to everyone,
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.620]   they thought that everyone should know what they thought.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.100]   All of the great classical works in philosophy
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.360]   from Plato onward were written from this point of view.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.620]   These books are accessible to the lay reader.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.500]   You can succeed in reading them if you wish to.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.620]   Everything that we have to say in this chapter
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.320]   is intended to help you do that.

[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.800]   On philosophical method.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.280]   It is important to understand
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   what philosophical method consists in,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.680]   at least insofar as philosophy is conceived as asking
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.600]   and trying to answer first order questions.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.920]   Suppose that you are a philosopher who is troubled
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.960]   by one of the childishly simple questions we have mentioned.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.120]   The question, for instance,
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.280]   about the properties of everything that exists
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.220]   or the question about the nature and causes of change.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.920]   How do you proceed?
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.560]   If your question were scientific,
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.160]   you would know that to answer it,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.040]   you would have to perform some kind of special research,
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.840]   either by way of developing an experiment
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.120]   to test your answer
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.120]   or by way of observing a wide range of phenomena.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.560]   If your question were historical,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.080]   you would know that you would also have to perform research,
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.680]   although of a different kind.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.840]   But there is no experiment that will tell you
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.480]   what all existing things have in common,
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.320]   precisely in respect to having existence.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.000]   There are no special kinds of phenomena that you can observe,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.300]   no documents that you can seek out and read
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.680]   in order to find out what change is or why things change.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.000]   All you can do is reflect upon the question.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.740]   There is, in short, nothing to do but think.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.440]   You are not thinking in a total vacuum, of course.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.760]   Philosophy, when it is good, is not pure speculation.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.840]   Thinking divorced from experience.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.560]   Ideas cannot be put together just any way.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.060]   There are stringent tests of the validity of answers
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.640]   to philosophical questions,
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.040]   but such tests are based on common experience alone,
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.920]   on the experience that you already have
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.640]   because you are a human being, not a philosopher.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.980]   You are as well acquainted through common experience
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.960]   with this phenomena of change as anybody else.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.520]   Everything in the world about you manifests mutability.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.640]   As far as the mere experience of change goes,
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.680]   you are in as good a position to think about its nature
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.960]   and causes as the greatest philosophers.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.600]   What distinguishes them
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.180]   is that they thought about it extremely well.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.400]   They formulated the most penetrating questions
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.720]   that could be asked about it,
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.680]   and they undertook to develop carefully
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.880]   and clearly worked out answers.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.240]   By what means?
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.880]   Not by investigation, not by having or trying
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.460]   to get more experience than the rest of us have.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.560]   Rather, by thinking more profoundly about the experience
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.680]   than the rest of us have.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.320]   Understanding this is not enough.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.760]   We must also realize that not all of the questions
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.680]   that philosophers have asked and tried to answer
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.980]   are truly philosophical.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.960]   They themselves were not always aware of this,
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.020]   and their ignorance or mistake in this crucial respect
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.240]   can cause unperceptive readers considerable difficulty.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.920]   To avoid such difficulties,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.960]   it is necessary to be able to distinguish
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.240]   the truly philosophical questions
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.020]   from the other questions that a philosopher may deal with,
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.540]   but that he should have waived
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.820]   and left for later scientific investigation to answer.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.160]   The philosopher was misled by failing to see
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.940]   that such questions can be answered
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.820]   by scientific investigation,
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.440]   though he probably could not have known this
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.240]   at the time of his writing.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.820]   An example of this is the question
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.040]   that ancient philosophers asked about the difference
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.740]   between the matter of terrestrial and celestial bodies.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.520]   To their observation, unaided by telescopes,
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.560]   it appeared to be the case
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.400]   that the heavenly bodies changed only in place.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.840]   They did not appear to come into being or to pass away
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.320]   like plants and animals,
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.520]   nor did they appear to change in size or quality.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.720]   Because celestial bodies were subject
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.880]   to one kind of change only, local motion,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.520]   whereas all terrestrial bodies
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.680]   change in other respects as well,
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.960]   the ancients concluded that they had to be composed
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.800]   of a different kind of matter.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.120]   They did not surmise,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.240]   nor could they probably have surmised,
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.320]   that with the invention of the telescope,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.080]   the heavenly bodies would give us knowledge
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.200]   of their mutability beyond anything we can know
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.760]   through common experience.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.560]   Hence, they took as a question
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.720]   that they thought it proper for philosophers to answer,
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.360]   one that should have been reserved
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.760]   for later scientific investigation.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.040]   Such investigation began with Galileo's use of the telescope
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.220]   and his discovery of the moons of Jupiter.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.700]   This led to the revolutionary assertion by Kepler
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.460]   that the matter of the heavenly bodies
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.280]   is exactly the same as the matter of bodies on Earth.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.000]   And this in turn laid the groundwork
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.720]   for Newton's formulation of a celestial mechanics
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.680]   in which the same laws of motion apply
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.000]   without qualification to all bodies,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.560]   wherever they are in the physical universe.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.680]   On the whole, apart from the confusions that may result,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.040]   the misinformation or lack of information
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.300]   about scientific matters that mars the work
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.340]   of the classical philosophers is irrelevant.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.280]   The reason is that it is philosophical questions,
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.620]   not scientific or historical ones,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.940]   that we are interested in when we read a philosophical work.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.720]   And at the risk of repeating ourselves,
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   we must emphasize that there is no other way
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.140]   than thinking to answer such questions.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.200]   If we could build a telescope or microscope
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.440]   to examine the properties of existence,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.020]   we should do so of course,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.360]   but no such instruments are possible.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.820]   We do not want to give the impression
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:42.800]   that it is only philosophers who make mistakes
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.520]   of the sort we are discussing here.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.720]   Suppose a scientist becomes troubled by the question
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.080]   about the kind of life a man ought to lead.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.640]   This is a question in normative philosophy.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.700]   And the only way to answer it is by thinking about it.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.540]   But the scientist may not realize that
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.220]   and instead suppose that some kind of experiment
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.060]   or research will give him an answer.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.500]   He may decide to ask 1000 persons
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.180]   what kind of life they would like to lead
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.260]   and base his answer to the question on their answers.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.340]   But it should be obvious that his answer in that case
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.060]   would be as irrelevant as Aristotle's speculations
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.960]   about the matter of the celestial bodies.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.580]   Now the chapter goes on and of course you should,
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.140]   if you haven't read the book, you should read it.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.180]   But what has stuck with me for years
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:31.180]   is that quote about how to reflect upon
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.460]   how to come to philosophical knowledge.
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.700]   Listen very carefully, I want to reread this.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.740]   "There is no experiment that will tell you
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.680]   what all existing things have in common,
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.040]   precisely in respect to having existence.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.620]   There are no special kinds of phenomena
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.460]   that you can observe,
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.300]   no documents that you can seek out and read
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.340]   in order to find out what change is
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.700]   or why things change.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.740]   All you can do is reflect upon the question.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.540]   There is in short nothing to do but think."
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.380]   Later, "As far as the mere experience of change goes,
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.580]   you are in as good a position to think about its nature
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.660]   and causes as the greatest philosophers.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.180]   What distinguishes them is that they thought about it
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.860]   extremely well.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.860]   They formulated the most penetrating questions
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.100]   that could be asked about it
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.380]   and they undertook to develop carefully
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.260]   and clearly worked out answers."
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.380]   By what means?
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.780]   Not by investigation,
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.060]   not by having or trying to get more experience
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.540]   than the rest of us have,
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.660]   rather by thinking more profoundly about the experience
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.540]   than the rest of us have.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:40.440]   This to me is what I think is at the core of philosophy,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.940]   is thinking.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.620]   And if you are going to engage your brain
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.180]   or your children's brains,
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.020]   the brain's function is thinking.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.020]   That's what it is for.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.100]   We are thinking creatures.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:59.260]   That is what differentiates us from other creatures.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:00.180]   And so,
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:07.280]   if logic is the base of all good scientific inquiry,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.780]   philosophy is the base of good thinking.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.940]   Earlier in the series,
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.060]   we talked about writing as a way to enhance thinking.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.180]   Philosophy is the purest form of thinking,
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.100]   simply considering a question,
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.620]   formulating it and thinking about it.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.020]   And it's been my experience that the practice of that
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:34.180]   lends to an interest and a wonder of the world
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.720]   that few other things do.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.900]   It also lends to a clarity of thought
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.740]   and just a sense of satisfaction
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.060]   when you catch a glimmer of the truth
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:49.980]   that is out there for us to conceive of with our minds.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.260]   And so I think that a study of philosophy,
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.860]   at the very least in a rudimentary way,
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:00.060]   is necessary for all youth.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:05.060]   Now, at what age is this an appropriate pursuit?
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:08.580]   This would seem to me one of those things
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.660]   that's appropriate for adolescents.
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.120]   And when we think about philosophy,
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.260]   that's the classic,
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.380]   it's part of the classic maturation process.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.700]   But friend, your child is probably not being taught
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.300]   any kind of reasonable approach to philosophy.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.300]   And so unless you can enroll him in a school
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.140]   where there is a solid philosophy curriculum,
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.540]   that's something you're going to have to do yourself.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.140]   The process of making up your mind
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.140]   as a young man or young woman
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.540]   about the great questions of life
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.300]   is natural and inevitable.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.940]   Children go through this.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.460]   What alarms me, however, in our modern age
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.560]   is that many young men and women
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.380]   are making up their mind without any appreciation
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.180]   or even knowledge of the tremendous progress
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.460]   that we as a human species have made
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.780]   on some of the big questions of life.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.340]   And so instead of standing on the shoulders of giants
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.580]   that have come before
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:12.260]   and have dedicated immense amounts of time and effort
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.860]   to thinking through and reasoning through these questions,
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.580]   and instead of positioning themselves
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.460]   to build upon that in their own lives
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.820]   as young men and women,
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:25.740]   I fear that our young men and women
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.340]   approach the subject as infants
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.060]   without any instruction, any exposure,
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.340]   and they somehow think that they've come up
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.220]   with the greatest thoughts in the world
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.820]   because their only estimation
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.860]   is their own thinking ability.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.420]   And I think that is a major flaw.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.220]   Let me close with a section later in,
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.700]   let me close my discussion of philosophy here
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.300]   with a section later in the same chapter
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.300]   on making up your own mind.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.100]   A good theoretical work in philosophy
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.940]   is as free from oratory and propaganda
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.940]   as a good scientific treatise.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.180]   You do not have to be concerned
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.340]   about the personality of the author
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   or investigate his social and economic background.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.580]   There is utility, however,
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.600]   in reading the works of other great philosophers
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.660]   who have dealt with the same problems as your author.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.300]   The philosophers have carried on a long conversation
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.360]   with each other in the history of thought.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.640]   You had better listen in on it
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.780]   before you make up your mind about what any of them says.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.620]   The fact that philosophers disagree
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.940]   should not trouble you for two reasons.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.060]   First, the fact of disagreement, if it is persistent,
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.780]   may point to a great unsolved
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.100]   and perhaps insoluble problem.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.500]   It is good to know where the true mysteries are.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.360]   Second, the disagreements of others
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.340]   are relatively unimportant.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.820]   Your responsibility is only to make up your own mind.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.760]   In the presence of the long conversation
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.220]   that the philosophers have carried on through their books,
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.680]   you must judge what is true and what is false.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.920]   When you have read a philosophical book well,
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.500]   and that means reading other philosophers
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.960]   on the same subject too,
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.700]   you are in a position to judge.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.960]   It is indeed the most distinctive mark
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.220]   of philosophical questions
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.960]   that everyone must answer them for himself.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.660]   Taking the opinion of others is not solving them,
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.880]   but evading them.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.280]   And your answers must be solidly grounded
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.200]   with arguments to back them up.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.320]   This means above all that you cannot depend
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.940]   on the testimony of experts,
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.640]   as you may have to do in the case of science.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.260]   The reason is that the questions philosophers ask
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.620]   are simply more important
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:24.180]   than the questions asked by anyone else, except children.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.520]   I myself do not yet know to what extent
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.560]   the study of philosophy should be carried out.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.200]   Certainly, there's a difference between,
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.140]   or there's a major range between zero knowledge
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.680]   of philosophy and philosophical categories
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.640]   versus PhD level philosophy studies.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.840]   I don't know where that right range is.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.480]   At the very least, our children should have some exposure
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.240]   to the great questions of life,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.820]   some of the answers of life,
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:56.820]   and should have exposure to the great range of thinking,
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.880]   so that they can be well-equipped to advance that.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.960]   And then of course, out of philosophy comes
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.000]   many of the practical sciences, social science,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.720]   politics, et cetera.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.240]   But at its foundation, we should make sure
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.320]   that our children are versed at least
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.360]   in the basics of philosophical thought,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.200]   and are at least aware of the great thinking
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.120]   that is out there, so that if they are interested
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   at a later date in going out and pursuing specialized study
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.160]   in one area or another, that they are equipped to do that.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.780]   In conclusion on today's show,
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.800]   I want you to teach your children logic and philosophy
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.120]   and how to use these tools.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:38.680]   For logic, I think the practical way to do this
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.480]   is to require your children to articulate the logic
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.880]   of their own ideas and those of others.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.480]   The study of formalized logic, fallacies, et cetera,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.760]   has a goal of helping to train good thinking,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.040]   but then that good thinking needs to be applied
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.600]   to specific subjects, to specific topics,
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.920]   to specific decisions.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   And so one way you can do this is by engaging
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.880]   in your children about the topics of the day,
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.760]   and most importantly, the topics of their life,
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.800]   and requiring them to defend to you
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.400]   the reasons for their decisions.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:21.600]   Young people who are consistently required
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:25.060]   to engage in logical analysis of their own thinking,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.400]   of their own actions, will be better equipped
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.680]   to make better decisions, and those better decisions
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.380]   will drive their life outcome.
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:41.260]   The decisions that we make in life drive the outcomes
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.600]   that we experience.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.160]   Obviously, there's action in between,
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.160]   but decision precedes action.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.920]   Excuse me, decision precedes action.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.320]   So at its starting point, decisions are the most important
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.800]   foundations to build, and so you can drill your children
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.160]   consistently by simply asking them what they're thinking
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.680]   about and why they're thinking about doing them,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.060]   doing those things, and require them to defend
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.280]   the logic of their own ideas to you.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.880]   This is something that I think my own father
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.520]   did extraordinarily well in my life
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.980]   and in the lives of my siblings.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.960]   When I was an adolescent, I enjoyed a much higher degree
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.920]   of freedom than many other people,
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.160]   because my dad's philosophy was to be a very strong,
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.360]   controlling parent in the early years,
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.920]   and then to back off massively and move into the role
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.040]   of a coach and mentor during the period of adolescence.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.920]   And so of course, there were still times
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.820]   when he had to step in and exercise control,
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.280]   but he exercised much less control than many other people.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.520]   But what he always did very effectively in my life
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.000]   was require me to articulate what I wanted to do,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.680]   why I wanted to do it, why a certain decision
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.720]   was a good decision, what would happen
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.400]   if a good decision weren't the case,
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.260]   or what it would happen if I made a bad decision,
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.880]   what I would do if I wound up making a mistake, et cetera.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.720]   And this constant questioning built within me a habit
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.680]   that prevails to this day of questioning my own thinking.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.000]   And this has helped me constantly to be able
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   to defend my ideas with greater clarity to myself,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.180]   primarily, but also to others, and also to be able
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.840]   to coach myself with more effectiveness,
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.160]   because I can observe where I'm behaving emotionally,
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.920]   I can observe where I'm behaving rationally,
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.720]   and I can consider the logical outcome of my actions.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.520]   And so the practical tool is teach your children
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.360]   tools of logic, but also require them just consistently
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.500]   to articulate the logic of their own ideas
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.640]   and their own plans, their own desires.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.600]   Also then require them to articulate the logic of others.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.360]   We are living in a society that seems bereft
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.360]   in some many parts of foundational logic.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.680]   People are living their lives based upon
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.640]   the fickleness of emotion only.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.240]   And when they make logical defense,
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.400]   it's important to listen and understand,
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.520]   but it's important to think about the logical train of being
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.560]   because in the same way that that example of the guy
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.320]   flying off the top of a skyscraper,
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   sometimes the logical idea,
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.360]   the logical outcome of an idea is very clear
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.160]   long before the results are seen.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.600]   It's interesting, you go back and you read history,
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.000]   and you read historians that with hindsight,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.880]   they look back and they say,
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.560]   "Well, World War I was inevitable because of these things."
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.560]   And then because of the way that World War I concluded,
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.960]   World War II was inevitable.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.600]   Or you think about geopolitics,
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.520]   a geopolitical strategist says,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.600]   "The success of this country or the orientation
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.080]   of this country in this direction is inevitable."
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.680]   And it's because of the logical outcome of certain facts,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.440]   certain things, and wise analysts can indeed
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.680]   see those things in advance.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.960]   The timing is often hard to get right.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.680]   No one would have said that World War I had to occur
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:10.240]   in 1914 or 1940 for World War II,
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.360]   or whatever the specific thing is.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.160]   The timing is hard to predict,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.920]   but the logical outcome is inevitable.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   And it's important to identify
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.800]   the logical outcome of ideas.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.040]   And especially as you move into adulthood,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.840]   this is one of the biggest things that for me,
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.160]   I've gained confidence in.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.680]   When I was younger, I thought,
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.080]   "Well, if so-and-so continues to live that way,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.560]   they're gonna wind up having this certain result."
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.160]   But I didn't have enough living under my belt
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.680]   to be confident in my analysis.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.040]   Today, with a bit more living,
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.280]   I have increasing levels of confidence.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.680]   If a guy overeats by 500 calories a week,
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.400]   he's going to wind up obese.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.040]   That obesity is going to wind up
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.520]   with medical complications.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.360]   He's going to wind up with all kinds of issues
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.240]   because of the fact that he is observably
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.720]   overeating by 500 calories a week.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.040]   Unless there is change, the outcomes are inevitable.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.320]   You can't predict it with precision,
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.160]   but you can predict it with good,
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:10.120]   with appropriate levels of accuracy.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.560]   You see this in relationships.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.200]   You watch a relationship between a husband and a wife,
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.360]   and you identify certain major red flags.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.200]   And regardless of the good face
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.040]   that the husband and wife put on today,
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.320]   their marriage is doomed unless they change.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.880]   Similarly, you see positive signs,
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.360]   and things are good, right?
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.680]   Relationship between a father and a child, et cetera.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.240]   You can see a good relationship,
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.000]   you know that things will eventually work out.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.840]   And so life is very logical.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.840]   We live in an orderly cause and effect universe.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.360]   We live in an orderly sowing and reaping universe.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.640]   And where there are causes, there are effects.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   Where there is sowing, there is reaping.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.760]   And so by discussing the logic of ideas,
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.640]   we can help our children to make wise decisions for them,
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.720]   for their families, and to be defended against those
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.120]   who would manipulate them.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.640]   And then on the topic of philosophy,
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   I think the importance of philosophy is to build empathy
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.920]   and to be able to disassociate ideas from people.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   A major issue that I observe in our modern era
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.560]   is that many people have a very hard time
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.240]   disassociating their ideas from one another.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.800]   Perhaps a political example would be a better example.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.560]   Today, many people have associate
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.880]   and draw their political ideology
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.160]   from a certain leaning or interest,
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.440]   from a sense of association, a political bent,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.320]   a political party, et cetera,
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.200]   rather than considering ideas
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.520]   in a logically, philosophically detached way.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.200]   And I myself find this very frustrating.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.640]   Maybe people are happier if they just say,
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.440]   I'm a partisan follower of this particular party
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.880]   and life is good.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.440]   But this doesn't lead to effective, productive outcomes.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.120]   And as an observer of politics and such, it drives me crazy.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.120]   Why don't people, why can't we make progress?
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.720]   Why can't we create political function instead of dysfunction
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.040]   by separating ideas and analyzing them on their merits?
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.320]   And I think that if we did more of that,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.400]   we could bring people together.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   We could create more peace and harmony in relationships.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.360]   But the starting point is to teach people
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.280]   to consider ideas, not people.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.720]   And not to say, well, I'm gonna reject that person's ideas
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.120]   'cause I don't like that person.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.880]   And so philosophy builds empathy
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.640]   and it helps people to be better thinkers.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.840]   I hope that you'll take these tools.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.560]   I hope that you'll teach them to your children.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.440]   And I hope that you will help your children
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.800]   to exercise their brains so that they can become smarter,
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.640]   both in a physical sense, as well as in a practical sense,
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.920]   and that they will learn through the rigorous application
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   of good logic and good philosophy to apply their ideas
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.560]   and to share their ideas in a way that as humans,
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.720]   we can advance and move on towards a better
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.520]   and better future.
