[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.000]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.360]   Today's podcast episode is about jet lag, shift work,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.560]   and we are going to discuss protocols
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.260]   that are backed by science
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.440]   that can support particular tools that you can use
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.680]   to combat things like jet lag,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.080]   offset some of the negative effects of shift work,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.160]   and make life easier for the new parent,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.740]   as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent,
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.640]   anyone that wants to sleep better,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.320]   feel better when they're awake, et cetera.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.700]   Let's just take a step back for a moment
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.240]   and remind everybody what we're talking about.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.560]   The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour rhythm
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.000]   in all sorts of functions.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.460]   The most prominent one is a rhythm
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.680]   in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.920]   You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.860]   that correlates with that.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.320]   We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.320]   getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.840]   when our temperature is increasing.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.820]   We have a clock over the roof of our mouth,
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.000]   a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.840]   That clock generates a 24-hour rhythm,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.600]   and that clock is entrained,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.760]   meaning it is matched to the external light-dark cycle,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.960]   which is, no surprise, 24 hours.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.360]   Spinning the earth takes 24 hours.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   So our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.540]   but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood,
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.420]   all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.860]   And if we are living our life in a perfect way
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100]   where we wake up in the morning
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.460]   and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.180]   and then by evening we catch a little sunlight,
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.820]   and then at night we're in complete darkness,
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.060]   we will be more or less perfectly matched
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.680]   to the external or ambient light-dark cycle.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.620]   Very few of us do that
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.580]   because of these things that we call artificial lights
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.920]   and this other thing that we call life demands.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.020]   So today we're going to talk about
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.320]   when we get pulled away from that rhythm.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.500]   So what is the perfect day?
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.560]   What does that look like
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.500]   from a circadian sleep wakefulness standpoint?
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.600]   You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.020]   but as much light into your eyes
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.280]   during the period of each 24-hour cycle
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.540]   when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.500]   And you want to get as little light into your eyes
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.240]   at the times of that 24-hour cycle
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.740]   when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.920]   How much is enough?
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.340]   Well, a good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.740]   is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.740]   before 9 a.m., 10 a.m. maybe, but before 9 a.m.,
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.820]   assuming you're waking up sometime between 5 and 8 a.m.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.820]   The mechanism of circadian clock setting
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.280]   involves these neurons in your eye
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.740]   that send electrical signals
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.160]   to this clock above the roof of your mouth.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.020]   And that system sums, meaning it adds photons.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.860]   It's a very slow system.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.060]   So here we're talking about trying to get
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.820]   that at least 100,000 photons, but not all at once.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.660]   So what do you do?
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.480]   You go outside.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.880]   Going outside, even on a cloudy day,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.980]   could be 7,000, 10,000 lux.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.540]   It's really remarkable how bright it is,
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.460]   meaning how much photon energy is coming through.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.340]   So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9 a.m.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.440]   Now, if you can't do that
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.300]   because you live in an area of the world
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.880]   where it's just not bright enough.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.340]   Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.460]   It's just not bright enough in winter.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.340]   Then, sure, you can resort to using artificial lights
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.860]   in order to get enough photons.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.300]   And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.380]   to get each day before 9 a.m.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.660]   You can, in theory, get it all from artificial lights,
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.740]   but there are some special qualities about sunlight
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.020]   that make sunlight the better stimulus.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.660]   Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.220]   that you look at sunlight
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.500]   sometime around the time when the sun is setting.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.820]   And the reason for that, of course,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.740]   is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.260]   because here's the diabolical thing.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.420]   While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.580]   to wake up our system and set our circadian clock
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.180]   and prepare us for a good night's sleep
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.220]   14 to 16 hours later,
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.580]   it takes very little photon energy
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.700]   to reset and shift our clock after 8 p.m.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.500]   And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.700]   avoid bright light and even not so bright light
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.660]   between the hours of 10 or 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.140]   So let's talk about shifting clocks,
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.060]   because for the jet lag person,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.340]   this ability to shift the clock
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.780]   with light temperature exercise and food
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.340]   is vitally important
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.540]   for getting onto the new local schedule.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.540]   And there's so much out there about jet lag today.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.500]   I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.820]   that all of you can figure out
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.560]   without any technology or devices
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.380]   or anytime you're jet lagged.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.980]   And I want to absolutely emphasize
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.380]   that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.300]   Many of you are jet lagged.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.920]   You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.860]   in the middle of the night.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.020]   You're jet lagged because you're waking up
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.900]   at different times of day.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.380]   You're jet lagged because your exercise
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.660]   is on a chaotic regime.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.860]   Some days at this time, some days at that time,
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.100]   but there are some simple things that you can do.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.080]   So that's where we're headed.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.900]   Let's talk about what jet lag is.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.980]   There are quality peer-reviewed papers
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.020]   showing that jet lag will shorten your life.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.700]   Jet lag is a serious thing.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.760]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.460]   Traveling westward on the globe
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.460]   is always easier than traveling eastward, okay?
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.100]   It's interesting because the effects of jet lag
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.660]   on longevity have shown that traveling east
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.320]   takes more years off your life than traveling west.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.060]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.540]   When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.760]   or this idea that it can shorten our lives,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.580]   we have to ask ourselves why, why is that?
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.160]   And it turns out there's a pretty simple
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.320]   explanation for this.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.520]   We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.720]   this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.160]   that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.940]   Turns out that human beings and probably most species
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.600]   are better able to activate and stay alert
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   than they are to shut down their nervous system
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.000]   and go to sleep on demand.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.080]   So if you really have to push
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.820]   and you really have to stay awake, you can do it.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.540]   You can stay up later,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.240]   but falling asleep earlier is harder.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.840]   And that's why traveling east
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.040]   has a number of different features associated with it
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.160]   that because you're traveling east,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.680]   you're trying to go to bed earlier.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.840]   You know, as a Californian, if I go to New York city,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.420]   I've got to get to bed three hours early
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.640]   and wake up three hours earlier,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.060]   much harder than coming back to California
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.040]   and just staying up a few more hours.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.800]   where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.760]   and go or forage for food or fight
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.120]   or do any number of different things
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.320]   that we can push ourselves
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.080]   through the release of adrenaline and epinephrine
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.960]   to stay awake.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.180]   Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.160]   is actually much harder to do.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.380]   So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.800]   that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.100]   All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.680]   Let's say you're not going eastward or westward,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.760]   but you're going north or south.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.280]   So if you go from, for instance, Washington DC
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.240]   to Santiago, Chile, you're just going north and south.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.680]   You're not really moving into a different time zone.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   You're not shifting.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.880]   So you will experience travel fatigue.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.800]   And it turns out that jet lag has two elements,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.840]   travel fatigue and time zone jet lag.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.540]   Time zone jet lag is simply the inability
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.020]   of local sunlight and local darkness
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.500]   to match to your internal rhythm,
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.260]   this endogenous rhythm that you have.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.220]   So before we get too complicated
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.700]   and too down in the weeds about this,
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.020]   I want to just throw out a couple important things.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.860]   First of all, some people suffer from jet lag a lot,
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.900]   other people, not so much.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.140]   Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.780]   There are reasons for that because early in life,
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.640]   patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.720]   and very high actually in children.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.400]   Then it becomes cyclic during puberty,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.300]   meaning it comes on once every 24 hours
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.760]   and turns off once every 24 hours.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.040]   And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.880]   and we become more vulnerable to even small changes
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.140]   in schedule, et cetera, meal times, right?
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.280]   So jet lag gets worse as we age.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.620]   or at least as easy and as simple
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.660]   as one could possibly make it, I believe.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.900]   What I want to talk about is perhaps
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.700]   one of the most important things to know
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.240]   about your body and brain,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.260]   which is called your temperature minimum.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.800]   Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24-hour cycle
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.400]   when your temperature is lowest.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.860]   Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer?
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.240]   It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.420]   before your average waking time.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.600]   Temperature actually is the signal
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.560]   by which this clock above the roof of your mouth
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.080]   entrains or collectively pushes all the cells
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.400]   and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.240]   Temperature is the effector.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.280]   And once you hear that, there should be an immediate,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.520]   oh, of course, because how else would you get
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.920]   all these different diverse cell types
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.680]   to follow one pattern, right?
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.900]   A pancreatic cell does something very different
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.640]   than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.000]   They're all doing different things at different rates.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.560]   So the temperature signal can go out
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.400]   and then each one of those
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.760]   can interpret the temperature signal
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.440]   as one unified and consistent theme of their environment.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   Here's the deal.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.380]   If you expose your eyes to bright light
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.640]   in the four hours after your temperature minimum,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.940]   your circadian clock will shift
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.320]   so that you will tend to get up earlier
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.340]   and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay?
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.420]   It's what's called a phase advance,
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.340]   if you'd like to read up on this further.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.240]   You advance your clock.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.840]   However, if you view bright light
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.560]   in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.960]   you will tend to phase delay your clock.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.480]   You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.160]   I tend to wake up at about 6 a.m.,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.920]   sometimes 6.30, sometimes 7.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.040]   It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.500]   as I'm guessing it does for you.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.480]   But that means that my temperature minimum
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   is probably somewhere right around 4.30 a.m.,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.960]   which means that if I wake up at 4.30 a.m.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.240]   and I were to view bright light at 4.35 a.m.,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.700]   I'm going to advance my clock.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.400]   I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.640]   and wake up earlier the subsequent morning.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.340]   And as I shift my wake-up time,
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.400]   my temperature minimum shifts too, right?
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.120]   If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.240]   before 4.30 a.m., guess what?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.600]   The next night I'm going to want to stay up later
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.640]   and I'm going to want to wake up later
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.760]   the subsequent morning.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.000]   Your temperature minimum is a reference point,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.120]   not a temperature reading.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.700]   Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.900]   and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever,
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.860]   96 point whatever, that's fine.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.420]   You can do that, but that information won't help you.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.140]   What you need to know is what time
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.420]   your body temperature is lowest
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.060]   and understand that in the four hours or so
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.460]   just after that time,
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.940]   viewing light will advance your clock
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.740]   to make you want to get up earlier.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.180]   So now you can start to see and understand
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.540]   the logic of this system.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.460]   You can now start to shift that temperature
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.700]   according to your travel needs.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.140]   Here's one way in which you might do that.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.260]   Let's say I am going to travel to Europe,
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.380]   which is nine hours ahead, typically, from California.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.940]   I would want to determine my temperature minimum,
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.040]   which for me is about 4.30 a.m., maybe 5.00 a.m.,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   and I would want to start getting up at about 5.30 a.m.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.580]   and getting some bright light exposure,
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.060]   presumably from artificial sources,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.660]   because the sunlight isn't going to be out at that time,
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.100]   maybe even exercising as well,
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.780]   maybe even eating a meal at that time.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.260]   You would want to start doing that
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.900]   two or three days before travel,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.660]   because once you land in, or I land in Europe,
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.300]   chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in Europe
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.060]   is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.220]   Some people say get sunlight in your eyes when you land,
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.380]   but that's not going to work,
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.660]   because one of two things is likely to happen.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.080]   With a nine-hour shift like that,
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.000]   either I'm going to view sunlight
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.720]   at a time that corresponds to the circadian dead zone,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.140]   the time in which my circadian clock can't be shifted,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.580]   or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.300]   at a time that corresponds to the four- to six-hour window
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   before my temperature minimum.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.140]   So it's going to shift me
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.820]   in exactly the opposite direction that I want to go.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.460]   So it can be very, very challenging
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.580]   for people to adjust to jet lag.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.860]   So you need to ask, am I traveling east,
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.760]   or am I traveling west?
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.580]   Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock?
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.420]   Remember, viewing light, exercise, and eating
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.740]   in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.760]   will delay your clock.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.880]   Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.920]   you don't have to do all three,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.580]   but some combination of those in the four to six hours
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.700]   after your temperature minimum will advance your clock.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.320]   And this is a powerful mechanism
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   by which you can shift your clock anywhere
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.780]   from one to three hours per day, which is remarkable.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.860]   That means your temperature minimum is going to shift out
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.060]   as much as three hours,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.500]   which can make it such that you can travel
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.440]   all the way to Europe.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.580]   And as long as you've prepared for a day or so
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.460]   by doing what I described back home,
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.800]   and then doing it when you arrive,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.060]   you can potentially accomplish the entire shift
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.500]   within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.640]   And so a lot of people are landing in Europe,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.580]   getting sunlight in their eyes,
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.180]   and throwing their clock out of whack,
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.460]   or not shifting their clock at all.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.720]   This brings me to the other thing that's highly recommended,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.760]   and I've mentioned this before,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.140]   but you want to eat on the local meal schedule.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.580]   If it's in your practice to fast, fast, that's fine.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.840]   But when you eat,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.900]   you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.060]   Okay, I talked about traveling eastward,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.340]   but we haven't talked about traveling westward.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.660]   Let's say you're traveling from New York to California,
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.780]   or from Europe to California.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.220]   The challenge there tends to be,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.200]   how can you stay up late enough?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.260]   Now, some people are able to do this,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.660]   because as I mentioned earlier,
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.780]   the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired,
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.020]   such that it's easier to stay up late,
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.180]   later than we would naturally want to,
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.680]   than it is to go to sleep earlier.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.820]   So let's say you land, and it's 4 p.m.,
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.380]   and you're just dying.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.980]   You're in California, you came from Europe,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.500]   it's 4 p.m., and you really, really want to go to sleep.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.920]   That's where the use of things like caffeine, exercise,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.400]   and sunlight can shift you, right?
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.720]   If it's after your temperature peak,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.660]   then viewing sunlight around 6 p.m. or 8 p.m.,
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.140]   or artificial light, if there isn't sunlight,
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.500]   will help shift you later, right?
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.100]   It's going to delay your clock,
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.260]   and you're going to be able to stay up later.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.120]   The worst thing you can do is take a nap
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.100]   that was intended to last 20 minutes or an hour.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.060]   I do this routinely, and then wake up four hours later,
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.260]   or you wake up, and it's midnight,
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.460]   and you can't fall back asleep.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.180]   You really want to avoid doing that.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.220]   So provided it's not excessive amounts,
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.100]   stimulants like caffeine and coffee or tea
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.300]   can really help you push past that afternoon barrier
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.420]   and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.700]   and eating on the local schedule as well.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.820]   A number of people have asked
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.000]   about the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.260]   Melatonin is this hormone
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.820]   that's released from the pineal gland.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.220]   Melatonin induces sleepiness.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.180]   Melatonin during development is also responsible
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.860]   for timing the secretion of certain hormones
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.780]   that are vitally important for puberty.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.460]   Does melatonin control the onset of puberty?
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.060]   Not directly, but indirectly.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.900]   Melatonin inhibits something
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.740]   called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.900]   which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus,
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.660]   also roughly above the roof of your mouth and your brain.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.500]   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.900]   'cause it stimulates the release of another hormone
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.360]   called luteinizing hormone,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.120]   which in females causes estrogen
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.100]   to be released within the ovaries.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.820]   It's involved in reproductive cycles,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.900]   and in males stimulates testosterone
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.960]   from the sertoli cells of the testes.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.180]   Melatonin is inhibitory to GNRH,
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.460]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.180]   and therefore is inhibitory to LH, luteinizing hormone,
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.140]   and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and estrogen.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.300]   There's just no two ways about it.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.940]   So melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.100]   when you want to fall asleep
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.500]   in the new location that you've arrived, right?
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.340]   You can't fall asleep.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.720]   You take melatonin, it helps you fall asleep.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.140]   It does not help you stay asleep.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.740]   In addition to that,
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.980]   melatonin has been kind of touted
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.700]   as the best way to shift your circadian clock.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.380]   I'm happy to go on record saying,
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.220]   "Look, if you need melatonin
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.620]   and you can work with a doctor
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.300]   or somebody who really understands circadian
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.160]   and sleep biology, go for it, if that's your thing."
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.660]   But I, as always on this podcast and elsewhere,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.900]   I have a bias toward behavioral things
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.200]   that you can titrate and control,
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.100]   like exposure to light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.900]   that have much bigger margins for safety
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.900]   and certainly don't have these other endocrine effects
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.620]   that we've been thinking about and talking about.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.940]   So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.020]   in order to fall asleep or in the evening,
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.080]   be my guest, that's up to you.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.940]   Again, you're responsible for your health, not me.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.860]   But for many people,
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.500]   melatonin is not going to be the best solution.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.380]   The best solution is going to be to use light
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.140]   and temperature and exercise
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.420]   on either side of the temperature minimum
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.260]   to shift your clock both before your trip
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.000]   and when you land in your new location
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.540]   and your clock starts to shift.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.820]   Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.860]   Feel free to filter them through your own opinions
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.220]   and experiences with melatonin.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.780]   And now you also understand what your temperature minimum is
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.460]   and how it represents an important landmark,
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.860]   either side of which you can use light temperature
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.380]   and exercise to shift your clock.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.000]   Just to remind you a little bit about temperature,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.960]   if you want to shift your clock,
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.060]   you can take a hot shower
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.120]   and then that will have a cooling effect
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.480]   after the hot shower.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.780]   And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath,
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.160]   if you have access to one,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.460]   afterward, there's going to be a thermogenic effect
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.660]   of your body increasing temperature.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.960]   So you can start to play these games
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.060]   with timing and hot and cold,
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.580]   with meals, whether or not you eat or you don't eat,
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.780]   and with light exposure,
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.260]   whether or not you view light or you don't view light.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.260]   So now you can start to see why understanding
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.320]   the core mechanics of a system
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.100]   can really give you the most flexibility.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.980]   And that really underscores the most important thing
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.420]   is that when you understand mechanism,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.140]   it's not about being neurotically attached
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.340]   to a specific protocol, it's the opposite.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.020]   It can give you great confidence and flexibility
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.100]   in being able to shift your body rhythms however you want.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.060]   And when things get out of whack,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.240]   you can tuck them right back into place.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.060]   One thing that's common
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.060]   is that people need to do a quick trip.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.820]   It's not always that you're going to go to,
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.180]   you know, on vacation for two weeks
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.980]   or, you know, work someplace else for weeks on end.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.300]   If your trip is 48 hours or less,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.740]   stay on your home schedule.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.160]   72, that's when you start running into trouble.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.480]   The transit time is also important,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.900]   but I would say if it's three days or less,
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.140]   stay on your home schedule as much as you can.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.460]   So let's talk a little bit about a different form of jet lag
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.240]   that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.720]   and that's shift work.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.480]   Shift work is becoming increasingly common.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.360]   Many of us are shift working even though we don't have to.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.220]   We're doing work in the middle of the night.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.500]   We are, you know, working on our computers at odd hours,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.580]   sleeping during the day.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.260]   Here's the deal with shift work.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.140]   If there's one rule of thumb for shift work,
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.960]   it's that if at all possible,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.920]   you want to stay on the same schedule for at least 14 days,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.740]   including weekends.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.020]   Now that should immediately cue the non-shift workers
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.720]   to the importance of not getting too far off track
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.460]   on the weekend, even if you're not a shift worker.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.020]   So sleeping in on Sunday is not a good idea.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.760]   The most important thing about shift work
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.500]   is to stay consistent with your schedule.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.180]   If you're going to work a shift where,
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.180]   let's say you start at 4 p.m. and you end at 2 a.m.,
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.280]   excuse me, then there's some important questions that arise.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.700]   For instance, should you see light during your shift?
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.020]   Well, this is a matter of personal choice,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.700]   but ideally you want to view as much light as possible
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.660]   and as safely possible when you need to be alert.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.540]   So that would mean from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.600]   And then you would want to sleep.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.340]   So using light as a correlate of alertness
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.340]   and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness,
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.900]   what this means is see as much light as you safely can
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.300]   during the phase of your day when you want to be awake.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.260]   So let's say you go to sleep at,
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.720]   you get home after this 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift,
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.620]   you maybe eat something, you go to sleep,
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   and you wake up and it's noon or 1 p.m.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.820]   Should you get light in your eyes?
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.920]   You guessed it, you need to know your temperature minimum.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.620]   You need to know whether or not
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.460]   your temperature is increasing or decreasing.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.540]   And now we can make this whole thing even simpler
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.380]   and just say, if your temperature is decreasing,
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.220]   avoid light.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.260]   If your temperature is increasing, get light.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.420]   It's that simple.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.300]   I'm going to pause there,
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.700]   and then I want to talk about kids and the elderly.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.300]   In other words, how do we control sleep
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.440]   and circadian rhythms and wakefulness in babies,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.220]   adolescents, teens, and aged folks?
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.720]   All right, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.540]   melatonin is not cyclic, it's not cycling in babies.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.700]   It's more phasic.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.820]   It's being released at a kind of a constant level.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.760]   And babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.580]   And so those concentrations of melatonin are very high.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.500]   As a baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.940]   are going to go down.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.080]   Babies are not born with a typical sleep-wake cycle,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.620]   and now all the parents are saying,
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.460]   "Tell me something I didn't know."
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.580]   Perhaps the most important thing,
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.820]   if you're having to map to a baby's schedule
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.080]   in order to make sure that they're getting changings
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.640]   and nursing, et cetera, at the appropriate times,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   is to try and maintain, if you can't sleep,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.140]   or you can't sleep continuously,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.340]   to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.620]   in a place where you're not going into heightened states
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.380]   of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.200]   Now, I realize that this could be translated
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.180]   to try and stay calm while you're sleep-deprived,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.300]   which is very hard for people to do.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.260]   But this is where the non-sleep-deep rest protocols
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.420]   surface again, and can potentially be very beneficial
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.220]   for people to be able to recover, not necessarily sleep,
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.640]   but for them to maintain a certain amount
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.260]   of autonomic regulation.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.220]   Last night, I woke up, I went to bed about 10.30.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.140]   I woke up at three in the morning.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.380]   I knew I wasn't feeling rested.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.220]   I did a NSDR protocol.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.300]   I fell back asleep.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.500]   I woke up at 6.30.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.420]   You need to teach your brain and your nervous system
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.660]   how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.300]   And ideally, you do that without medication,
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.700]   unless there's a real need.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.340]   You do that through these behavioral protocols.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.660]   They work because they involve using the body
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.560]   to shift the mind, not trying to just turn off
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.940]   your thoughts in the middle of the night.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.100]   Similar circumstances can arise if you're taking care
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.700]   of a very sick loved one, you're up all night.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.300]   Try and stay calm using NSDR protocols.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.480]   I know it's harder to do than to say,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.780]   but those protocols are there, they're free.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.500]   There's research to support them.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.500]   Try and get sleep whenever you can,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.780]   but also try to get morning sunlight
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.040]   and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.780]   And if you can't get that, use artificial light, okay?
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.580]   Once again, I've thrown a tremendous amount
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.660]   of information at you.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.220]   I hope you will figure out your temperature minimum
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.620]   and start working with that to access
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.860]   the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want to access.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.180]   I hope that you'll explore NSDR.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.200]   You have now access to a lot of mechanism
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.540]   about sleep and wakefulness.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.340]   I really believe that as we drill deeper and deeper
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.560]   into these mechanisms and you start hearing
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.700]   some of the same themes again and again,
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.220]   you're going to start to develop an intuition
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.560]   and an understanding of how these systems work in you
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.220]   and your particular life circumstances.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.300]   So know your temperature minimum.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.420]   Understand light in the early part of the day is valuable.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.540]   Light when you want to be awake,
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.200]   provided it's not so bright, it's damaging.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.900]   It's great for you whether or not it comes from screens
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.900]   or sunlight, but sunlight's better.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.760]   Avoid light in the four to six hours
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.120]   before your temperature minimum,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.560]   or else you're going to delay your clock
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.420]   unless you're traveling and that's what you want to do, okay?
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.340]   Use temperature, increase temperature to shift your clock.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.620]   Decrease temperature to delay your clock.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.220]   Thanks so much for your time and attention.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.600]   I really appreciate it.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.400]   See you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.260]   And as always, thanks for your interest in science.
