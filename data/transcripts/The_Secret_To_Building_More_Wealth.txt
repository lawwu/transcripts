[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   Hello, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about the importance
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.720]   of working smarter, not harder, for financial independence.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.660]   So one of the guest posts that I had recently published was called "My Secret to Retiring
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.000]   Early with Only 4 Million Net Worth and 2 Kids."
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.760]   So there are two trigger words here, "secret" and the word "only."
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.000]   And this has been complained about in the comments section multiple times.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.360]   And I wanted to address this because yes, the word "secret" is a trigger word and "only"
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.440]   obviously is going to piss a lot of people off who don't have $4 million.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.760]   But this is one man's perspective on how he was able to retire at 41 with about $4 million
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.680]   in net worth, a wife and two kids ages 5 and 8.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.320]   And if you read the post, you'll discover that his "secret" was being able to marry
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.760]   well and to work with a partner who had the same ideals as him in terms of saving and
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.560]   investing and planning for the future.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.600]   And she is going to continue to work, she's going to make at least $350,000 if not more
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.360]   once she becomes a partner at a law firm.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.400]   And he is going to take a step back and spend more time with his children and relax.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.960]   Now if you were to look at Juna, the guest poster, his financial situation, he was able
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.680]   to amass a net worth of $2.5 million.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.560]   So can you retire early off $2.5 million at age 41?
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.880]   I would say you definitely can.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.760]   They are technically not married.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.880]   So he amassed $2.5 million, she has amassed $1.5 million which equals $4 million.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.480]   But she's also two years younger than he is.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.960]   And sooner or later, she's going to build an even greater net worth.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.040]   So one of the main complaints is, why is Juna considered early retired when women who take
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.880]   off work to raise kids are considered stay at home mothers?
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.040]   That's a great point and that's a point that I've been bringing up in the past as well.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.260]   Why are there some men in the personal finance sphere who just say they are early retirees
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.080]   when their wives continue to work, bring home the bacon, provide health care insurance,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.320]   and that's security?
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.440]   Well, the reason why a lot of men say they are early retired is due to ego.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.640]   Men have fragile egos.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.680]   You can't tell, we all want to be puff puff the providers and we want to say we left on
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.120]   our terms and we are retired and we don't have to do anything.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.600]   When in reality, taking care of kids is much harder than any day job that I've ever had
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.280]   and I worked in banking.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.440]   We're talking for at least my family crying every day.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.840]   You got to reason, you have to have patience, you have to have just so much concentration
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.200]   when taking care of young children because one look away could mean a disaster.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.120]   So ego is the main reason why a lot of men say they are early retired even though they
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320]   are full time stay at home fathers.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.720]   Now let's turn the situation around.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.760]   Why can't women say they are early retirees as well?
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.320]   I say women absolutely can if they want to.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.760]   It's equality.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440]   Women can say they gave up their careers to be full time mothers and that's a great and
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.240]   important career.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   If you're a child, you obviously want to have more time with your parents than less.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.640]   And so if someone can give up their career, especially if it's at the pinnacle of their
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.280]   career, Juna became a partner and he was a partner for three years until he said, "You
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   know what?
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.520]   I've seen the pinnacle.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400]   I know what it's like to be a partner.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.240]   I'm going to leave now and not have regrets because more money is not going to make me
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.560]   happier and more money is not going to make our family happier."
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.820]   So I was pleased that some commenters were able to recognize how difficult it was to
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.640]   walk away from a lucrative career and a prestigious career.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   You know, three years in as partner, maybe in 10 years, Juna will be making over a million
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.760]   dollars a year.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.840]   And Juna had the courage and the foresight to plan ahead to walk away for the betterment
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   of his family.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.680]   And I think that should be respected.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.840]   Everybody's got a different situation, but I think that's a very respectable move.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.240]   We have been talking for a long time on Financial Samurai about how to balance the income, the
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.680]   net worth and happiness.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.500]   At the end of the day, we want to be happy and we want to use money to make us happy
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.020]   and live the experiences that we want.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.480]   So for Juna and his family, he thought $4 million combined, good enough.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   You know, I believe thanks to inflation, $3 plus million is the new millionaire threshold
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.360]   for living like a millionaire from 30 years ago.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.400]   And in probably 10 years, $5 million is probably going to be the new $1 million.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.840]   It's just what inflation does.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.720]   It makes the cost of living more and more expensive.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.600]   And we all know this in the year 2022 with the print at over 8.5%.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   Don't forget those I-bonds going to pay over 9%.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.040]   That's something to check just FYI.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.160]   But a $4 million net worth is broken down into about $1.2 million for the primary residence
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.280]   and $2.8 million in investable assets.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.500]   Those investable assets, according to the Post, generates about $60,000 to occasionally
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.740]   up to $120,000.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.600]   And they have a lifestyle that requires $160,000 a year for their ideal lifestyle.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.160]   So $160,000 a year means you got to make about $200,000 a year gross.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.400]   Therefore, only one of them can retire early.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   And the fact of the matter is his wife doesn't want to retire early because she wants to
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.680]   see what it's like to become a partner as well.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.880]   And then maybe after two, three years, she might think, "Oh, I know what being a partner
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.040]   is like, making more money is like, the prestige is like the status."
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.360]   And maybe she'll join Juna in early retirement.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.560]   But she's not going to quit before she gets to that pinnacle.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.760]   Otherwise, she's going to have that regret.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.120]   So in my circumstance, I tried to become a managing director.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.400]   But after one year, I decided, "I tried.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   I'm out of here."
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.440]   At least I tried.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.220]   But if I didn't even try, if I wasn't even up for promotion to managing director after
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.840]   three years of director, then I would always be wondering, "Okay, what if I did try and
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.120]   I could have got to MD and then my life would have been better?"
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.200]   I don't think it would have been.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.880]   I would have had more stress and more responsibility, albeit having a bigger bonus at the end of
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.320]   the year.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   But at least I tried.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.680]   And I think this is what everybody has to contend with.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.520]   If you don't try to get to the top of your career or whatever it is you're doing, will
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.120]   you regret it?
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.920]   And for me, the answer was yes, I would regret it.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.640]   For Juna, the answer is no because he achieved it.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.160]   And for his wife, it probably is yes, she'll regret it if she left early.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.200]   And besides, they've got two young kids and they're just staggering their early retirement.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.940]   Now I want to focus on the word secret, his secret to retiring early.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:14.040]   A lot of us were focused on saving, investing, making right choices, and then going from
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   there.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.560]   We have like this heroistic individualism.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.200]   I don't know what you say, what it's called, but we just focus on ourselves.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.400]   In America, it's like independence, individualism.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.560]   But what I think this message is saying, this post is saying, is the secret is to actually
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.640]   find someone who shares your same ideals.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.400]   Life is so much easier when you have someone who believes in what you believe and has the
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.060]   same goals.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.000]   So maybe instead of spending so much time reading and listening about personal finance,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.260]   how to invest, how to get richer, asset allocation, and so forth, we should spend more time developing
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:01.340]   relationships, really key relationships, obviously, with our significant other, but also with
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.860]   those in our network, building a strong network that can pull us ahead when we fall or when
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.040]   we want more opportunity.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.020]   One commenter said, "The secret in this case wasn't some money investment management insight
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.660]   that I think a lot of us hoped for.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.820]   The secret was partnering with a rich person who was cool with you working but making no
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.820]   income."
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.480]   Now, if you read the post, you will have learned that Juna and his wife met in law school when
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.700]   they were both broke and in debt.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.820]   So back then, they didn't know what their future held.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.200]   Maybe they could have dropped law altogether like many, many lawyers do after 5, 10 years.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.100]   Maybe they could have just changed professions and become social workers.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.680]   You just don't know.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   But you got to make an investment.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   And the good thing about relationships is that you can nurture your relationship to
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   improve it.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.680]   You can whisper sweet nothings during pillow talk or you can encourage them to do better
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.900]   or you can pick them up when they're down.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.800]   You can do a lot of things to improve a relationship.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.640]   Whereas if you're a passive investor in a stock, you're just going to hope that management
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.480]   has their head on straight and they do the right thing.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:17.320]   I have a feeling a lot of us, if we use percentages, are around, let's say, 80% focused on how
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:23.620]   to optimize our finances and maybe 20% on how to improve our relationships with our
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.640]   significant others and other people in our network.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.520]   I think that percentage change or difference is too much.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:38.600]   I think we should probably move in more towards 50/50 or 60% money, 40% relationships.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.040]   And if you don't have someone, if you're single, you should probably spend more than
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.360]   50% of your time trying to find someone to partner with.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.640]   Because again, partnering with someone who you love just makes life so much better and
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.880]   so much easier.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.040]   And just think about the simple situation of, let's say, splitting rent costs.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.640]   There's a $1,500 one bedroom or two bedroom.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.760]   It's $1,500 if it's just you, but it's $750 if you split it equally and you like to share
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   that space with someone.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.640]   It's just that much easier.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.160]   So in conclusion, please try to nurture your relationships, your existing relationships,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.840]   and your future relationships.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   I think they'll do a lot to help you build wealth and happiness over time.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.340]   Thanks so much everyone for listening.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.980]   If you liked this episode, I'd love a positive review and share it around.
