[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   The following is a conversation with John Donaher,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.000]   widely acknowledged as one of the greatest coaches
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   and minds in the martial arts world,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.320]   having coached many champions in jiu-jitsu,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.520]   submission grappling, and MMA,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.000]   including Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Nick Rodriguez,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Chris Weidman, and George St. Pierre.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.960]   Onnit, Simply Safe, Indeed, and Linode.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.280]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.200]   As a side note, let me say that John is a scholar
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.160]   of not just jiu-jitsu, but judo, wrestling,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.720]   Muay Thai, boxing, MMA, and outside of that,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.040]   topics of history, psychology, philosophy,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.200]   and even artificial intelligence,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.640]   as you will hear in this conversation.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.520]   After this chat, I started to entertain the possibility
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.160]   of returning back to competition as a black belt,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.320]   maybe even training with John and his team for a few weeks,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200]   leading up to the competition.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.840]   For a recreational practitioner, such as myself,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.320]   the value of training and competing in jiu-jitsu
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.600]   is that it is one of the best ways to get humbled.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600]   To me, keeping the ego in check is essential
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.360]   for a productive and happy life.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.000]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.560]   and here is my conversation with John Donaher.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.760]   Are you afraid of death?
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.200]   - I start with an easy question.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400]   - There's no warmup, that's it?
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.640]   - No warmup. - We're straight up,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.720]   no jumping jacks?
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.120]   - Let's break that down into two questions.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.640]   I'm a human being, and like any human being,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.400]   I'm biologically programmed to be terrified of death.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360]   Every physical element in our bodies
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.200]   is designed to keep us away from death.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.840]   I'm no different from anyone else in that regard.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.280]   If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.200]   I'm gonna scream all the way down to the concrete.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.720]   If you wave a loaded firearm in my face,
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.400]   I'm gonna flinch away in horror
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.080]   the same way anyone else would.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.320]   So in that first sense of, are you afraid of death,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.720]   my body is terrified of injury leading to death
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.680]   the same way any other human being would.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.360]   - So when death is imminent, there's a terror that--
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.560]   - Yeah, I go through the same adrenaline dumps
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.860]   that you would go through.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.960]   But on the other hand,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.680]   you're also asking a much deeper question,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.560]   which is presumably, are you afraid of non-existence?
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.520]   What comes after your physical death?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   And that's the more interesting question.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   No, I should start right by saying from the start,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.400]   I'm a materialist.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.200]   I don't believe that we have an immortal soul.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.160]   I don't believe there's a life after our physical death.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.240]   In this sense, from someone who starts
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.400]   from that point of view,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   you have to understand that everyone has two deaths.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.040]   We always talk about our death as though there was only one,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.780]   but we all have two deaths.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.780]   There was a time before you were born when you were dead.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.680]   You weren't afraid of that period of non-existence.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.080]   You don't even think about it.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.760]   So why would you be afraid
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.440]   of your second period of non-existence?
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.040]   You came from non-existence.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.560]   You're gonna go back into it.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.320]   You weren't afraid of the first.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.700]   Why are you somehow afraid of the second?
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.920]   So it doesn't really make sense to me
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.000]   as to why people would be afraid of non-existence.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.240]   You dealt with it fine the first time.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.720]   Deal with it the second time.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   - But your mind didn't exist for the first death.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.400]   - And it won't exist after you die either.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.240]   - But it does exist now enough to comprehend
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.280]   that there's this thing that you know nothing about
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.240]   that's coming, which is non-existence.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.400]   - Actually, you do know about it
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.560]   because you know what it was like before you were born.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.160]   It was just nothing.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.280]   Every time you go to sleep at night,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.880]   you get a sneak preview of death.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.840]   It's just this kind of nothing happens.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.280]   You wake up in the morning, you're alive again.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.520]   - But it's not about the sleeping.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.640]   It's about the falling asleep.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.560]   And every night when you fall asleep,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.760]   you assume you're going to wake up.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   Here you know you're not waking up.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.600]   And the knowledge of that--
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.200]   - But there's a whole step from that
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.920]   to the idea of fearing it.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.400]   I'm fully aware that there's gonna be a time
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.480]   I don't wake up.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.800]   But are you gonna be afraid of it?
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.680]   Is there some mortal terror you have of this?
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.080]   No, you didn't have it before.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.120]   You don't have it when you sleep.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   Going from the fact that you know you won't wake up
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.080]   to terror is two different things.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.480]   That's an extra step.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.960]   And at that point, you're making a choice at that point.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.040]   - What about what some people in this context
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.800]   we might call the third death,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   which is when everybody forgets,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   the entirety of consciousness in the universe
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.720]   forgets that you've ever existed,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.760]   that John Donahuer ever existed.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.880]   - It's almost like a cosmic death.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.400]   It's like everything goes.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.560]   - Not just, I would say it's like knowledge.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.800]   The history books forget about who you are
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.000]   because the history books--
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.280]   - This is inevitable, by the way.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.840]   We're all very, very small players in a very big game.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.680]   And inevitably, we're all going to go at some point.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.640]   - Yeah, but doesn't, to your--
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.240]   - It's disappointing, of course.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.800]   (Lex laughing)
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.320]   But it's not even, it would be arrogant to say
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.560]   I'm disappointed in the idea that I will disappear.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.160]   But there's far greater things than me that will disappear.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   I mean, it's crushing to think that there's gonna come
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.840]   a time where no one will ever hear
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.920]   Beethoven's symphonies again,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.880]   that the mysteries of the pharaohs will be lost
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.960]   and no one will even comprehend that they once existed.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.440]   Humanity has come up with so many amazing things
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.680]   over its existence.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.560]   And to think that one day this is just all happening
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.280]   on a tiny speck in a distant corner of a very small galaxy
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.240]   and among millions of galaxies,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.040]   that this is all for nothing.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.080]   Okay, I can understand.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.320]   There's a kind of dread that comes with this.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.800]   But there's also a sense in which the moment you're born
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.480]   and the moment you can think about these things,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.840]   you know this is your inevitable fate.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.000]   - Is it so inevitable?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.280]   So if we look at, we're in Austin
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   and there's a guy named Elon Musk.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.160]   And he's hoping, in fact, that is the drive
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.800]   behind many of his passions,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.720]   is the human beings becoming multi-planetary species
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.200]   and expanding out, exploring and colonizing
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.680]   the solar system, the galaxy,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.880]   and maybe the rest of the universe.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.200]   Is that something that fills you with excitement?
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.220]   - As a project, it's very exciting.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.800]   The whole, I mean, we all grew up with science fiction,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   the idea of exploration the same way human beings
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.120]   in earlier centuries were thrilled
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.760]   with the idea of discovering a new world,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.920]   you know, America or some other part of the world
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.560]   that they sail to and come back.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.280]   But now instead of sailing oceans,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   you're sailing solar systems and ultimately even further.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.900]   So of course that's exciting.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.080]   But as far as relieving us from non-existence,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.960]   it's just playing a delaying game
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.040]   because ultimately, even the universe itself,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.940]   if the laws of thermodynamics are correct,
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.320]   will ultimately die.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.560]   - Of course, we might not understand most of the physics
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   and how the universe functions.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.080]   You said laws of thermodynamics,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.960]   but maybe that's just a tiny little fraction
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   of what the universe actually is.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.320]   Maybe there's multiple dimensions.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.920]   Maybe there's multiple universes.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.480]   Maybe the entirety of this experience,
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.360]   you know, there's guys like Donald Hoffman
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.380]   that think that all of this is just an illusion,
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.700]   that we don't, like human cognition and perception
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.560]   constructs a whole, it's like a video game
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.040]   that we construct that's very distant
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.580]   from the actual reality.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.640]   And maybe one day we'll understand that reality.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.720]   Maybe it'll be like the matrix kind of thing.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.080]   So there's a lot of different possibilities here.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.840]   And there's also a philosopher named Ernest Becker.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   I don't know if you know who that is.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.920]   He wrote "Denial of Death" and his idea,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.960]   he disagrees with you, but he's dead now,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.880]   is that he thinks that the terror of death,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.380]   the terror of the knowledge that we're going to die
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.040]   is within all of us and is in fact the driver
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.480]   behind most of the creativity that we do.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.600]   Exploring out into the universe,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.840]   but also you becoming one of the great scholars
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.560]   of the martial arts, the philosophers of fighting
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.480]   is because you're actually terrified of death.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   And you want to somehow permeate like your knowledge,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.520]   your ideas, your essence to permeate human civilization
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.600]   so that even when your body dies, you live on.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.160]   - I would agree with him insofar as death
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.080]   is the single greatest motivator for action.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.120]   But going beyond that and saying that it's somehow terrifying
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.200]   that's an extra step on his part.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.560]   And not everyone's gonna follow him on that step.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   I do believe that death is the single most important element
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.280]   in life that gives value to our days.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.920]   If you think for example of a situation
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.340]   where a God came to you and gave you immortality,
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.360]   life would be very, very different for you.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.020]   You're a talented research scientist,
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.720]   you work to a schedule, why?
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.260]   Because ultimately you know your life is finite
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.140]   and actually very finite.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.800]   And could be even more so if fate plays its hand
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.960]   and you die an early death or what have you,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.120]   we never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:18.160]   As such, we get work done as soon as we can.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.340]   The moment you gain immortality,
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.960]   you can always put every project off.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   You can always say, I don't need to do this today
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.120]   because I can do it four centuries from now.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.320]   And as you extend artificially a human life,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.120]   the motivation to get things done here and now
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.320]   and work industriously and excel fades away
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.720]   because you can always come back to the idea
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.120]   that you can do this in the future.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.960]   And so what gives value to our days is ultimately death.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   And value, it's not the only reason behind value,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.520]   but a huge part of what we consider value is scarcity.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.120]   And death gives us scarcity of days.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.660]   And is probably the single greatest motivator
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.240]   for almost every action we partake in.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.280]   - It's kind of tragic and beautiful
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   that what makes things amazing is that they end.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:22.480]   - Yeah, I think it would actually be a terrible burden
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.640]   to be immortal.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.120]   Life would be in many ways very hollow
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.880]   and meaningless, I think.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.160]   People talk about death taking away the meaning of life,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.440]   but I think immortality would have a very similar effect
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.720]   in a different direction.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.360]   - So given this short life,
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   we can think about jiu-jitsu,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.320]   we can think about any kind of pursuit.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.280]   What do you think makes a great life?
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.120]   Is it the highest peak of achievement?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   You think about like an Olympic gold medal,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.200]   the highest level of performance,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.560]   or is it the longevity of performance
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.240]   of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time?
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.400]   I think the latter is kind of what we talk about
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.640]   in at least American society.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   We want people to be healthy, balanced,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.360]   perform well for a long time.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic,
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.800]   which is the highest peak is what defines--
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.440]   - You asked an initial question,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   which what makes a great life?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   But then pointed towards two options,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   one of longevity versus degree of difficulty.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.740]   There's gotta be a lot more than that, surely.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.960]   I mean, think about, first of all,
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.360]   we have to understand from the start
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.080]   that there's never gonna be an agreed upon set of criteria
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.680]   for this is a great life from all perspective.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.720]   If you look from the perspective of say Machiavelli,
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.880]   then Stalin lived a great life.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.000]   He was highly successful at what he did.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.360]   He started from nothing.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.480]   So the degree of difficulty in what he did
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.400]   was extraordinarily high.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.800]   He had massive impact upon world history.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.240]   He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.640]   He lived to old age and died of natural causes.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.920]   So from Machiavelli's point of view, he had a great life.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.000]   If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.080]   whether he lived a great life,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.680]   you get a very different answer.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.400]   So everything's gonna come from what perspective
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.760]   you begin with this.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.080]   You're going to look out at the world
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   with a given point of view
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.240]   and you're gonna make your judgments.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.940]   Was this a great life or was this a terrible life?
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.000]   Going back to your point, you were actually, I think,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.360]   focusing the question on more in terms of
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.320]   great single performances versus longevity performances.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.520]   - Yes.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.920]   - Presumably this isn't really a question about
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.360]   what makes a great life then
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.920]   because there's so much more than that to a great life.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.760]   - I don't know.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.840]   I'm gonna push back on that.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.440]   So I think the parallels are very much closer
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.080]   in that you're making them seem.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.920]   I think, let's compare Stalin.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.440]   Stalin is an example of somebody who held power,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.080]   considered by many to be one of the most powerful men ever.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.140]   He held power for 30 years.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.120]   So that's what I'm referring to, longevity.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.920]   And then there's a few people,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.140]   I wish my knowledge of history was better,
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.880]   but people who fought a few great battles
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.840]   and they did not maintain power.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.680]   - Let's contrast here, for example, Alexander the Great
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.640]   who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   Had around four to five truly defining battles in his life
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:58.880]   which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.520]   and burned very bright, but didn't burn long.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.360]   Stalin on the other hand started from nothing
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.560]   and quietly methodically worked his way
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.960]   through the revolutionary phase
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.420]   and gained increasing amounts of power.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.920]   And as you said, went all the way
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.280]   to the end of his career.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.160]   Yeah, there's definitely something to be said for longevity.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.880]   But as to which one is greater than the other,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   you can't give a definition or a set of criteria
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.560]   which will definitively say this is better than that.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   But when you look, ultimately we look at Alexander is great,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.840]   but in a different way.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.020]   When we look at Stalin, I don't think many people
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.220]   would say Stalin was a great person,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.320]   but from the Machiavellian point of view,
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.340]   say he was great also.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.380]   - But when you think about beautiful creations
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.700]   done by human beings in the space of say martial arts,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.260]   in the space of sport, what inspires you?
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.900]   The peak of performance?
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.460]   - I see where you're coming from, Lex.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.180]   It's a great question.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.960]   For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.100]   But things are difficult in different ways.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.320]   A single flawless performance in youth
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.260]   is still that wins a gold medal.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.020]   Let's say for example, Nadia Comaneci won the Olympic
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.240]   gold medal in gymnastics,
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.160]   the first person ever to get a perfect score.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.420]   If she had disappeared after that,
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.100]   we would still remember that as an incredible moment.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.300]   And the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.000]   in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.240]   And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.060]   and got four silver medals.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.940]   I mean, they're both incredible achievements.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.100]   They're just different.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.380]   The attributes that lead to longevity
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.780]   typically tend to conflict with the attributes
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.260]   that bring a powerful single performance.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.560]   One is all about focus on a particular event.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   The other is on spreading your resources over time.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.100]   Both present tremendous difficulties.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.440]   There's no need to say one is better than the other.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.700]   - There's also just, for me personally,
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.700]   the stories of somebody who truly struggled
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.100]   are the most powerful.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.420]   I know a bunch of people don't necessarily agree
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.620]   'cause you said perfection.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.140]   Perfection is kind of the antithesis of struggle.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.500]   But I look at somebody, okay, in my own life,
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.840]   somebody I'm a fan of, I'm a huge fan of yours.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.000]   I'm trying not to be nervous here.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.100]   But somebody I'm a fan of in the Judo world
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.040]   is Travis Stevens.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.000]   - He's a remarkable fellow, by the way.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.480]   - Remarkable human being.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.880]   Insane in the best kinds of ways.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.560]   I think I started Judo.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.000]   I really started martial arts.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.960]   I wrestled, if you consider those martial arts.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.480]   That's been in my blood.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.760]   I'm Russian, so.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.820]   But beyond that, the whole pajama thing we wear, the gi,
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.740]   I started by watching Travis in 2008 Olympics.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.260]   - Was that accidental?
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.060]   Did you know Travis prior to watching him?
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.900]   - No, no, no.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.740]   I just tuned in.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.380]   - Now, that's an unusual choice.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.220]   It was just random?
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.300]   You just tuned in and you saw Travis Stevens?
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.820]   - I tuned into the Olympics
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.180]   and I was wondering what Judo is.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.060]   And then I started watching.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.740]   We're all proud of our countries and so on.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.740]   So I started watching.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   He was, I think, the only American in the Olympics for Judo.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.620]   Maybe the, so this Kayla Harrison was 2012.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.020]   And Rhonda was there too.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.360]   So I watched Rhonda and Travis.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.500]   But obviously, sort of, I was focused on somebody
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.060]   who also weighed the same as I did.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.560]   So there was a kind of, I think, 81 kilograms.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.780]   So there's a connection,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.660]   but also there's an intensity to him.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.660]   Like, he would get angry at his own failures
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.860]   and he would just refuse to quit.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.580]   It's that kind of Dan Gable mentality.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.100]   I just, that was inspiring to me, that he's the underdog.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.620]   And the way people talk about him, the commentators,
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.400]   that it was an unlikely person to do well, right?
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   And I, the FU attitude behind that,
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.260]   saying, "No, I'm gonna still win gold."
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260]   Obviously, he didn't do well in 2008,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.380]   but that was somehow inspiring.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.460]   And I just remember he pulled me in,
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.500]   but then I started to see this sport,
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.820]   I guess you can call it,
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:47.140]   of effortlessly dominating your opponent in, like, throwing.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.240]   'Cause to me, wrestling was like a grind.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.920]   You kind of control, you slowly just break your opponent.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.380]   The idea that you could, with like a foot sweep,
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.900]   was fascinating to me.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.100]   That just because of timing,
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.500]   you can take these like monsters, giant people,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.660]   like incredible athletes, and just smash them.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.180]   It just doesn't, there was no struggle to it.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.980]   It was always like a look of surprise.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.580]   Judo, dominance in judo has a look of,
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.340]   like the other person's like, "What just happened?"
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.180]   - Yes.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.560]   - This is very different from wrestling.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.640]   - It's built into the rule structure, too.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.040]   The whole idea of an Ippon,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.280]   of a match being over in an instant.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.020]   And that creates a thrilling spectator sport.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.080]   Because you can, as you say,
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.980]   with Ashiwaza, the foot sweeps,
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.720]   you can take someone out who's heavily favored.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.420]   And if you're not, judo is the most unforgiving
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.480]   of all the grappling sports.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.380]   If you have a lapse of concentration for half a second,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.220]   it's done, it's over.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.160]   If those guys get a grip on each other,
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.660]   any one of them can throw the other.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:11.060]   When you see someone like Nomura,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.220]   who won three Olympic gold medals,
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.500]   to win across three Olympics,
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.460]   and that's an incredible achievement,
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.520]   given how many ways there are to lose
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.900]   in the standing position in judo,
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.660]   and how unforgiving it is as a sport,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.700]   it shows an incredible level of dominance.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.700]   - And I think when I was also introduced at that time
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.420]   to the idea, just like in judo,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.180]   I think in jiu-jitsu is the same,
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.660]   a lot of sports is probably the same,
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.160]   is there's ways to win that include kind of,
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.140]   if I were to use a bad term, stalling.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.320]   Which is like, use strategy to slow down,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.640]   to destroy all the weapons your opponent has,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.280]   and just to wait it out.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.460]   To sort of break your opponent by,
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.200]   yeah, shutting down all their weapons,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.880]   but not using any of your own.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.720]   - Yes.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.520]   - And now, Travis was always going for,
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.020]   he's of course really good at gripping,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.320]   and can do that whole game,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.920]   but he was going for the big throws.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.560]   And he was almost getting frustrated
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.720]   by a lot of the opponents.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.680]   I remember Ola Bischoff, I think.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.640]   - Yes, from Germany.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.480]   - From Germany.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.320]   - Very talented.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.340]   - Very incredible.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.600]   I know he's very good at doing big throws,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.840]   and he's incredible jidoka,
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.760]   but he was also incredible at just frustrating his opponents
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.080]   with gripping and strategy and so on.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.680]   And I just remember feeling the pain of this person,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.120]   like Travis, who went through,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.400]   just, he broke like every part of his body.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.520]   He went through so many injuries.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.040]   Just this person who dedicated his entire life
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   to this moment in 2008, and then 2012, and 2016,
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   just gave everything.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.660]   You could see it in his face,
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:04.520]   that his weapons are being shut down,
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.120]   and he's still pushing forward.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   He's still with that, both the frustration and the power.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.620]   I mean, the kind of throw he does,
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.720]   is his main one, I think, is the standing.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.920]   It's called Seinagi.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.760]   - Ippon Seinagi.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.600]   - Ippon Seinagi.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.240]   But that was the other thing,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   is like the techniques he used was these big throws,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.080]   that there's something to me about the Seinagi.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.180]   I fell in love with that throw.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.480]   That's become my main throw, standing Seinagi.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.440]   That is like-
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.280]   - Why do you favor the standing variation?
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.520]   Because of the amplitude?
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.920]   You get a more powerful wind up.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.400]   - Yeah, power.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.240]   It's like-
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.400]   - Are you a fan of Koga?
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.240]   - Yes.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.200]   So Koga and Travis opened up my-
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.640]   - Travis uses the same gripping patterns
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.840]   for Seinagi as Koga does.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.640]   - All the same, and the way he uses his hips and turns.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.960]   And I remember going to my judo club,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.120]   and other judo clubs, and they were all saying,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.160]   "This is the wrong way to do it.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.960]   "The way Travis does it is the wrong way to do it."
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.800]   And I remember-
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.240]   - I've always been amazed by this, by the way.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.520]   I don't mean to cut you off,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   but I could literally feel 20 hours of reproductions
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.200]   of people who will tell me that either my students
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.280]   or other great world champions are doing things wrong.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:35.040]   And I'm looking at them, and I'm like,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.320]   "Who would I rather trust here in their judgment?"
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.320]   Koga, who was one of the greatest throwers of all time,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.480]   or you, a recreational guy who couldn't throw my grandmother.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.440]   - Yes.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.760]   - I'm supposed to take your word over his.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.640]   Well, don't listen to what people say.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.520]   I'm gonna give you a piece of advice here.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.040]   Watch what the best people do, okay?
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.240]   That's how you get superior athletic performance.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.160]   I'm gonna say that again.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.040]   Don't listen to what people say.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.280]   Watch what they do, particularly under the stress
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.440]   of high-level competition,
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.560]   because that's when you see their real game,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.280]   what they really do under pressure.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.200]   Okay, and if you can emulate that,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.000]   you're gonna be very successful.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.720]   - I guess what I was frustrated with, to your point,
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.920]   is that the argument against Koga is,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.040]   he has a very specific body type,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.560]   and he figured out something that worked for him.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:45.840]   The statement is, that might not be applicable to you,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.440]   or to the general public of judo players
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.200]   that wanna succeed.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.720]   That, by the way, at the shallow level, might be true.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.240]   Might be true.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   The point is, there might be a body of knowledge
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.040]   that's yet to be discovered and explored
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.440]   that Koga opened up,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.160]   that I wanted to understand why his technique worked.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.640]   It made no sense to me, that with a single foot,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.400]   like the way you turn the hip,
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.680]   the single foot that steps in, why does that work?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   Because it was actually very difficult to make work,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.360]   for me, as a white belt, in the very beginning.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.720]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.240]   Like, people just, they don't get loaded up onto your hip.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.920]   Anyway, for people who don't watch Koga highlights,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.840]   watch Travis Stevens highlights,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.880]   but the details of the technique don't make sense,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.320]   but when mastered, it feels like
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.360]   there's something fundamental there
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.080]   that hasn't been explored yet.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.520]   It's like Koga and Travis made me think
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.440]   that we don't know most of the body mechanics
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.800]   involved in dominance in judo.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.040]   Like, we just kind of found a few pockets
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.000]   that work really well.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.320]   The uchimata, there's these different throws,
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.120]   osoto gari, I wonder if there's like totally cool new things
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.160]   that we haven't discovered,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.960]   and that's saying I gave a little peek,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   because there's very few people that I'm aware of
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.840]   that do it the way Travis and Koga did.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.320]   - May I ask you a question?
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.160]   - Yes.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.520]   - The choice of standing seoi nage,
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.600]   I should say this for your listeners,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.440]   they're probably thinking,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.800]   what the hell are these two guys talking about?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.160]   Seoi nage is one of the more high percentage throws
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.600]   in the Olympic sport of judo.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.280]   Probably uchimata is probably number one,
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.120]   and variations of seoi nage would be
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.640]   in the top five for sure.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.680]   The basic choice you have in modern competition
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.880]   is the more difficult standing seoi nage,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.960]   where you literally are up on your feet
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.320]   and you perform a shoulder throw
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.640]   that takes your opponent over
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.680]   from a full standing position.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.240]   The most popular form of seoi nage
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.080]   in modern competition by a landslide
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.440]   is not the standing version.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.480]   It's a drop seoi nage where you go down to your knees.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.480]   This means you have a much easier time
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.440]   getting underneath your opponent's central gravity.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.480]   The defining feature of any seoi nage
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.760]   is getting underneath your opponent's central gravity
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.600]   and lifting them.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.440]   The seoi literally means to lift and carry.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.520]   Why did you choose the more difficult version?
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.720]   What was your motivation?
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.880]   You know, you're a smart kid,
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.680]   you know right from the start
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.320]   that for every standing seoi nage,
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.640]   there's 20 drop seoi nage in modern competition.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.840]   One is obviously more high percentage.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.320]   One obviously works for a wider variety of body types.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.280]   The number of people who are successful
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.840]   with standing seoi nage is dramatically lower.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.600]   And it appears to be a move which is completely absent
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.160]   in the heavyweight divisions
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.320]   and rarely seen in the lightweight divisions.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.880]   Why, what was the motivation?
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.080]   Why did you willingly adopt the less high percentage
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.960]   over the more high percentage? - This would be
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.360]   very interesting.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.480]   I would love you to break it apart
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.280]   because I apply the same kind of thinking
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.400]   to basically everything.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.480]   I mentioned to you offline,
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.960]   there's these Boston Dynamics spot robots.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.240]   When I first met Spot, I fell in love.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.600]   I don't understand what exactly,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.720]   but there's magic there.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.600]   And I just got excited by it.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.440]   And that fire burns.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.680]   I wanna work with these robots.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.640]   I wanna work with robots.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.600]   I want to, I felt like there's something special there
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.480]   that I could build something interesting with,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.120]   create something interesting with.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.280]   In the same way with the standing seoi nage
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.080]   from Koga and Travis, I just fell in love
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.920]   with that technique.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.160]   Just even watching, I didn't even know
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.800]   what the hell to do with it.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.560]   - Was it aesthetic?
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.960]   The standing seoi nage is more beautiful in execution.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.880]   There's no question.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   - In my own, we're talking about love here, right?
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   In my own definition of aesthetic,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.400]   yes, it's not just beauty 'cause you could argue
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.520]   there's more elegance, sort of uchimata
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.320]   is very beautiful and effortless.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.800]   I love something about the dominance of it.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   I love the idea in sport of two people
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.840]   that are the best in the world
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.120]   and one of them dominating the other.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.960]   And to me, the standing seoi nage,
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.880]   you're lifted off your feet.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.800]   And especially when it's done perfectly
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:37.240]   and with really strong resistance from the other person,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.160]   it results in a big slam.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.880]   And that was like beautiful to me.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.600]   That's the Alexander Kurelin, like big pickups.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.720]   I love that.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.480]   - It's interesting, you're correct.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.240]   Insofar as you're not just going with aesthetic
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.840]   and the sense of beauty, but also,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.240]   but you are making, as it were, value judgments
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.160]   about the throw.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.880]   And that's fascinating to me
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:09.160]   because there's two elements to any grappling sport.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.680]   I'm always insistent upon the idea
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.880]   that jiu-jitsu is both an art and a science.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.520]   Okay, it has scientific elements
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.080]   insofar as it works according to the laws of physics
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.280]   and lever and fulcrum, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:28.000]   But it also has an aesthetic element
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.200]   insofar as you're making choices with technique.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.680]   You're expressing who you are as a person.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   You have 10,000 different variations of moves you could use,
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.760]   but you're specifically choosing these.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.760]   That's an element of choice and self-expression on your part.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.160]   And insofar as that is true,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.920]   combat sports are not just a science,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.320]   but they're also an art.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.800]   So most combat sports have this sense
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.160]   which they have the features of both an art and a science.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   And it's not just about high percentage in your case.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.240]   I mean, me personally, I'm obsessed with percentages.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.400]   What are the ways to make you win?
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.360]   - That's the science part.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.400]   - Yeah, but that's also, choice is involved.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   Yeah, but there is an undeniably aesthetic element
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.520]   to martial arts where you, as it were,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.640]   express who you are as a person
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.240]   in terms of the techniques you're ultimately going to choose.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.720]   - Does that get in the way?
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   Do you allow yourself to enjoy
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.600]   the aesthetic beauty of a technique?
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.520]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.940]   When martial arts are done well,
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.200]   it's the most beautiful sport in the world.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.440]   Okay, when it's done poorly, it's the ugliest.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   But a beautifully applied submission hold,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.320]   a perfect throw, a superbly set up takedown
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.480]   are among the most difficult techniques
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.860]   they execute in all of sports.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.860]   And when they're done well, they're magic to observe.
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.460]   - But do you prefer certain techniques over others
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.880]   because of their, like for example, I'll tell you,
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.760]   for me, chokes of all sorts, with the gi, without the gi,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   probably with the gi is the most beautiful to me personally.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.080]   - I value them above all others.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.720]   People mostly associate myself and my students
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.640]   with leg locking.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.320]   They're usually rather surprised to learn
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.040]   that I actually value strangleholds far above leg locks.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.520]   But not for aesthetic reasons, for effectiveness.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.660]   We can talk about that later if you wish.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.100]   - Well, let's step back.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.400]   - Sorry, we drifted awfully far off topic then.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.800]   - I think this is beautiful.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.320]   - We drifted along the river of life and martial arts.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.280]   Can you explain the fundamentals of jiu-jitsu?
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.960]   - Yes, if I couldn't, I wouldn't be much of a coach.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:55.240]   Jiu-jitsu is an art and science
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.320]   which looks to use a combination
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.260]   of tactical and mechanical advantage
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.120]   to focus a very high percentage of my strength
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.280]   against a very low percentage of my opponent's strength
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.720]   at a critical point on their body
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.960]   such that if I were to exert my strength
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.440]   upon that critical point,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   they could no longer continue to fight.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:26.640]   - Well, that's about weapons and defenses.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.880]   But then, is there something more to be said
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.960]   about the set of tools that we're talking about?
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.280]   - That's where the art comes in
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.040]   because ultimately, you have a set of choices
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.560]   and those choices that you make
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.280]   will be an act of self-expression on your part.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.140]   Some will prefer this, some will prefer that.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.360]   That's where you come in as an individual.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.560]   - That's an overall definition of jiu-jitsu,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   of being a set of choices
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:35:00.480]   that where you're using the things you're powerful in
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.560]   versus the things your opponent is weak in.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.720]   - No, I was only talking about percentages of body strength.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.040]   If I have, for example, let's say we have two athletes,
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.920]   athlete A and athlete B.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.000]   Athlete A has 100 units of strength,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.900]   however we define that overall.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.920]   Athlete B has 50.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.400]   Okay, so ostensibly, athlete A is twice as strong
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.380]   as athlete B.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.400]   But athlete B can maneuver his body
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.360]   into a set of positions focused around a critical point,
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.000]   this opponent's body,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.840]   where he can apply 40 units of strength
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.280]   out of his total of 50.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.740]   His opponent can only defend with 20 units of strength
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.960]   out of his total of 100.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.680]   You have now completely reversed the strength discrepancy.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.660]   Originally, athlete A was twice as strong as B.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.840]   Now, on that one localized point,
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.080]   the knee, the elbow, the neck,
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.060]   B is now twice as strong as A.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.580]   Under those circumstances, B should win.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.560]   - I guess what I'm trying to get at,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.500]   by the way, that's really beautifully said,
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   is what you just said could be applied to other games,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.060]   other battles, could be applied to the game of chess.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.380]   It could be applied to war, most obviously in war.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.340]   I think about, for example,
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.380]   the American strategic bombing campaign in World War II.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.200]   The Eighth Army Air Force was tasked
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.500]   with the idea of destroying German industry.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.340]   Did they attack all of German industry?
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.980]   Of course not, that would be stupid.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.300]   They attacked the ball bearing industry.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.580]   Why?
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.980]   Because almost all of modern machines
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.780]   require ball bearings in order to operate.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.620]   In order for the mechanical interfaces
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.620]   of machines to operate, you have to reduce friction.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.940]   It's done through ball bearings.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.940]   If you knocked out one tiny component of German industry,
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.920]   the ball bearing industry, the rest of it couldn't operate.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.520]   So too with the human body.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.260]   I didn't have to fight your whole body.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.760]   I just have to fight your left knee.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.960]   If I can break your left knee,
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.640]   the rest of your body is irrelevant to me.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.680]   - But then isn't the art of jiu-jitsu
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.400]   discovering the left knee,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.000]   discovering the weak points--
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.860]   - Yeah, a huge part of jiu-jitsu
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.900]   is understanding the strengths and weaknesses
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.200]   of the human body.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.760]   There's parts of the human body that are shockingly robust
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.480]   and there are other parts that are shockingly vulnerable.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.200]   The major joints and of course the most vulnerable of all,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.560]   the unprotected neck.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.680]   - So if we take the something I'm not familiar with
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.920]   but I was incredibly impressed by is the body lock
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.080]   that I saw--
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.400]   - Nick Rodriguez.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.000]   - Nick Rodriguez used last time a few weeks ago.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.840]   But then I also got to hang out with Craig Jones
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.680]   who showed that--
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.640]   - Also has a very good body lock.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.240]   - So that was, I don't know if this body lock
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.440]   applies to all positions,
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.440]   but I was seeing it from when Craig is on top
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:22.360]   of your opponent and trying to pass in the guard,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.840]   use the body lock as a controlling position.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.520]   The principle behind it is that it shuts down,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.120]   as you've spoken about,
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   it shuts down the weapons of a very strong opponent.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.240]   - That's absolutely correct.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.960]   In the case of guard position,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.600]   what makes guard position dangerous,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.200]   what makes someone a powerful guard player
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.800]   is the movement of their hips,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.660]   forward and backward and side to side.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:56.020]   Body locking is designed to shut down that movement
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.780]   and does a very fine job of it.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.780]   You'll see all of my students excel at it.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.500]   Gordon Ryan is probably the single best
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.220]   body lock guard passer I've ever seen.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.980]   Nicky Ryan is outstanding with it.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.620]   Nick Rodriguez is very good.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.140]   Craig Jones is outstanding.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.820]   All of my students use this for a very simple reason.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.280]   Understand what is the central problem
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.880]   of shutting down a dangerous guard player.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.940]   It's his hips.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.420]   That's what makes him a dangerous leg locker.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.060]   You go up against a dangerous leg locker,
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.060]   body lock guard pass,
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.560]   single best way to shut down most of his entries.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.420]   We're all strong in leg locks.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.740]   So in our gym,
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.940]   you gotta control the hips as soon as possible.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.360]   Otherwise it's gonna be a very difficult thing
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.260]   to avoid leg entanglements as you go to pass.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.860]   And across the board,
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.420]   my students excel in body lock guard passing.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.800]   They understand what's the most dangerous feature
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.640]   their opponent has,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.320]   the lateral movement of their hips.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.420]   What's the single best way to stop that?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.260]   Body lock.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.840]   And then work from there.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.160]   - So if this asymmetry of power is fundamental to jiu jitsu,
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.300]   how do you discover that?
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.120]   How did you discover the body lock
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.240]   that as one of many methodologies
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.320]   of achieving this asymmetry?
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.740]   - It would be an overstatement to say
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.280]   we discovered the body lock.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.820]   Body lock passing has been around
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.960]   longer than we've been around.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.300]   But what I would say is that
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.360]   in a room full of dangerous leg lockers,
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.080]   you've gotta have a way to shut down the hips.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.500]   And so once we started using body locks,
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.300]   we saw that was one excellent way
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.240]   to get around that problem.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.140]   As with all development,
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.320]   it comes from trial and error.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.800]   You will often see people teach the technique
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.780]   to a certain level and you see the teaching,
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.780]   you're like, there's a lot of inadequacies there.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.880]   And that doesn't cover a lot of the problems
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.120]   that we're encountering.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.240]   And so trial and error is the single most important part
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.920]   of the development.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.560]   - Trial and error in?
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.640]   - In the training room amongst ourselves.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.520]   - In hard training or?
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.280]   - No, it never begins with hard training.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.520]   Or everything, techniques are born
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.840]   the same way we're born, weak and in need of nutrition.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.340]   (Luke laughs)
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.880]   You have to build them up organically like children.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.800]   And you start with minimal resistance
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.560]   and you make progress over time.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.640]   When you first go to the gym,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   do you put 500 pounds on the bench press
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.720]   and try to bench press it?
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.000]   No, you'll be killed.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.080]   You start off with the bar, you build over time
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.880]   and then one day, five years from now,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.240]   perhaps you really are lifting 500 pounds.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.140]   But only a fool would attempt that on their first attempt.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:41.840]   - And they're born like children in your mind first?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.760]   Like there's a spark of an idea.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.080]   - Yes, there's always a spark.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.320]   It's like scientific development on a subject matter
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.720]   which is intrinsically simpler.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.560]   There's a sense in which naive
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.440]   and overly simplistic assessments of scientific method
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.080]   may not work well at advanced levels of science,
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.480]   but they work damn well in the training room with jiu-jitsu
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.800]   where the subject matter is inherently simpler
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.840]   than it is in research science.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.320]   And as a result, there'll be a spark.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.760]   You'll see something, there's possibilities there.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.400]   Okay, let's puzzle this out, let's work with this.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.000]   And you run into a lot of failures.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.680]   There's, you know, you've suddenly been,
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.120]   oh man, if I put my hip this way, this works really well.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.320]   Then suddenly you try and spar
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.320]   and you get caught in a simple Loma Plata.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.560]   And you're like, okay, that didn't work as well
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.480]   as I thought.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   And then you look to rectify things.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.040]   If things go in promising research directions,
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.880]   you keep them.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.000]   If not, you discard them.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.280]   - It's funny you say science.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.200]   It feels more like art.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.440]   There's somebody I really admire
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.760]   that talks about this kind of ideas, Johnny I from Apple.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.520]   He's the lead designer.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.120]   He recently left, but he was the designer
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.760]   behind most of the products we know and love from Apple.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.040]   - When you say designer, be more precise.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.620]   What exactly was he working on in Apple?
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.240]   - The iPhone.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   - Which parts of the iPhone did he work on?
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.680]   - Like the entirety of it.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.560]   - Was he a leader of a research team
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.840]   or was he the person personally responsible
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.760]   for the development?
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   - He's kind of, I would say, very similar to your position.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.640]   He wasn't necessarily the last,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.840]   the person executing the manufacture, right?
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.680]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.240]   - But there's the, he's somebody that's very hands-on.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.560]   And it's like, okay, so he worked,
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.000]   obviously extremely closely with Steve Jobs.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.120]   Steve Jobs has this idea.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.880]   We should have a computer that's as thin
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.400]   as a sheet of paper.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.560]   And then you start to play with ideas of like,
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.400]   what does that actually look like?
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.720]   The reason I bring it up is because he talked about,
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.020]   he had these ideas that he would not tell Steve
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.200]   because he talked about in the same exact language
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.840]   as you're saying is there's like a little baby
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.040]   that it's very fragile.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.400]   It needs time to grow.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.240]   - Absolutely.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.640]   - And then Steve Jobs would often roll in.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.560]   - Was too ruthless.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.640]   - Too ruthless.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.260]   This is, he would destroy ideas
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:20.240]   because Johnny Ive and the team didn't have actually
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.480]   good responses to the criticism at first
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.360]   because when they're babies, you can't defend the baby,
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.520]   but you need a time to develop.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.800]   You need to sleep on it.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.880]   You need to rethink it.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   Did you dream things and all those kinds of things?
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.000]   - Yes.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.400]   It's fascinating you say this Lex
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.720]   because this is actually the entire history
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.680]   of scientific development is literally the story
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.480]   of the juxtaposition between the need to protect
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.920]   and nurture new theories versus the need
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.400]   to rigorously test them with harsh testing
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.160]   that either verifies them or falsifies them.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.180]   And learning to find a satisfactory compromise
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.180]   between those two is a very, very difficult thing.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.660]   When you look at the history of science,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.580]   you will see that there's some pretty damn chaotic moments
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.920]   anytime there's major theory change
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   where all kinds of apparently undesirable tricks
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:23.340]   are used to protect certain theories
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.980]   with ad hoc hypotheses, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:30.980]   And ultimately only time and the ability
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   and success over time will justify a theory.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.540]   There's usually a period where when one theory
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.300]   goes in to replace another,
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.940]   there's something of a battle between competing groups
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.980]   of scientists, some of whom advocate theory A,
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.840]   some who advocate theory B.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.160]   They often use seemingly unscrupulous methods
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.420]   to protect or attack another person's theory.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.980]   They dig for proofs.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.100]   And usually some period of time has to go by.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.660]   Sometimes in some cases it simply involved
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.160]   older scientists protecting an initial theory dying off
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   and new scientists just replacing them with numbers.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.820]   And this is a common, common theme.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.300]   And the same applies in jiu-jitsu.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.340]   So many times, especially when I first started working
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.900]   with leg locks, I would show things I had worked on
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:28.660]   to even world champion black belts.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.620]   And they would try it once or twice and fail.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.900]   Be like, ah, it doesn't work.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.740]   And I'd be like, you tried it once on another guy
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.020]   who's also a world champion,
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.420]   who has a strong ability to resist it.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.460]   And that's it, no more, it doesn't work.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.980]   And then five years later they would see my students
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.020]   finishing world champions with it.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.420]   And in some cases, finishing the very people
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.700]   who said that the technique would never work.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:01.420]   I mean, if there was ever a refutation of a statement,
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.920]   that's a pretty clear example.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.860]   And there has to be a sense in which
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.820]   you can't be too forgiving, you have to test hypotheses.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.060]   But on the other hand, you can't be too ruthless either.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.780]   You have to look for promise.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.060]   And my advice is start slow.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.940]   Like again, the analogy of lifting weights,
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.860]   you don't lift the heaviest weights on your first day,
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.820]   you build up, you work progressively over time.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.660]   Now, you also have to have some common sense here.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.180]   You can't be too forgiving to a technique
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.340]   if it's repeatedly failing.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.940]   And good people have tried it,
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.740]   and multiple good people have tried it,
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.820]   and it's just not working out,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.220]   then, okay, it's time to dismiss it.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.420]   But don't be too quick.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:50.900]   - Is this where your idea of training with lower belts
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.620]   quite a bit comes from?
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.260]   I've actually just as a side comment,
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.960]   and maybe you can elaborate.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.900]   The place, the gym, Balance Studios
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.540]   with Phil and Rick McElree's where I got my black belt,
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.620]   where I grew up as a jujitsu person in Philadelphia,
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.660]   they have a huge number of black belts,
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.980]   but they have a huge number of all other ranks.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.100]   And the way they picked sparring partners,
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.860]   people you train with, is very ad hoc, it's very loose.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.980]   It's very, one of those places,
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.380]   one of those gyms where you can just kind of,
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.900]   you can train for like three, four hours.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.740]   - That's great.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.500]   - You could take a break, or you could jump back in.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.500]   - Very informal, yeah.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.620]   - And you can go to war with black belts,
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.780]   but then you can also play around
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.540]   with the purple and the blue belts and so on.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.380]   - Excellent.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.380]   - And that was really beneficial for growth.
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.100]   And you can pick which, 'cause everybody has a style,
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.060]   and you can pick which style
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.900]   you really wanna work on, right?
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   And then I came to Boston, Broadway Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.500]   with John Clark, who I love, he's a good friend.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.160]   But it's a little bit more formal,
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.980]   and I found myself, it's a very interesting journey.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.860]   I would be training with black belts the whole time.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.940]   And it was a very different experience.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.620]   I found myself exploring much less.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.980]   I found myself learning much less.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.260]   I mean, part of that is on me,
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.220]   but part of it was also realizing that,
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.860]   wow, there's a value to training
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.940]   with people that are much worse than you.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.940]   - Yes.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.420]   - Is there a philosophy you could speak to on that?
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.840]   - Yeah, you probably know it already.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.340]   You know from your studies in artificial intelligence
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.580]   that all human beings are naturally risk-averse.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:42.540]   This is a bias which is deeply seated in all of us.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.380]   I'm sure you're well-read on people like Dvorsky
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.980]   and et cetera, who talk about this all the time.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.500]   For your viewers, there are numerous psychological
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.700]   experiments that are showing that most people,
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.860]   to the point of irrationality, fear loss more
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:04.820]   than they are excited at the prospect of an equivalent gain.
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.220]   So for example, if you have $100 in your wallet,
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.780]   you're more worried about the idea of losing
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:14.020]   the $100 that you have now than you would be excited
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.360]   by the prospect of gaining $100
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.660]   that I could potentially offer you.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:24.640]   This comes out whenever you get black belt
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.300]   versus black belt confrontations,
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:30.240]   or any kind of similar skill level.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.300]   Whenever you get similar skill levels,
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.700]   the chances of defeat get very, very high.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.480]   Interestingly, if you're a white belt
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.200]   and you're going against a black belt, you'll take risk.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.340]   Why?
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.000]   Because there's no shame in losing to a black belt
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.840]   when you're a white belt.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.800]   So you'll play more lightheartedly
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.140]   and you'll have a more fun role.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.760]   But when you have very similar skill levels,
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.780]   you're gonna come back to what?
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.820]   The techniques that are most likely to get you a win.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.840]   That number of techniques is usually pretty small.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.220]   And if you're always battling with the same tough opponents
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:11.820]   every day, where if you make even a single error,
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.560]   it will cost you that match in sparring,
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.860]   and you don't like losing,
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:21.560]   you're going to stay with a very small set of moves.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.720]   You might get slightly better at direct execution over time,
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.520]   but you as an individual will not grow.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.580]   Growth, as it does in organic life forms,
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:37.680]   comes from small beginnings and builds over time.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.240]   You can't take an untested, untried move
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.440]   and get it on a world champion black belt.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.460]   It's gonna get crushed.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.840]   So it's not ready for that.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.600]   It's like a lion cub being thrown out
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.600]   into the Serengeti Plains.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.900]   A lion cub is just too small and too ineffective.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.400]   It's a lion, but it's a cub.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.100]   And it's not until it grows into maturity
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:58.940]   that it can be a lion
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.840]   that can dominate the Serengeti Plains.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:06.160]   That's why I always encourage my students
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.680]   to play with a variety of belt types
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.660]   and spend the majority of their time
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.740]   with lesser belts for development purposes.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.500]   When you're getting closer to a competition,
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.900]   you obviously want to change that.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.860]   You want to be getting more
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.660]   a competitive sense of hard work.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.220]   But you must learn to divide up your training cycles
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.820]   into non-competition cycles,
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.140]   where you're presumably working with people
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.220]   who are slightly lower in level than yourself,
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.340]   and in some cases, quite a bit lower than yourself.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.100]   And then competition cycles,
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.020]   where you're working with people
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.820]   much closer to your own skill level.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.260]   - Is there something to be said
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.080]   about the flip side of that,
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.580]   which is when you're training with people
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.500]   at the same skill level, being okay losing to them?
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.340]   - Yes.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.980]   You have to see training for what it is.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.140]   Training is about skill development,
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.780]   not about winning or losing.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.860]   You've got to understand
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:10.780]   that you don't need to win every battle.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.620]   You only need to win the battles that count.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.100]   And the battles that count
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.100]   are in the World Championship finals.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.860]   Okay, that's the one that counts.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.900]   Think about that win.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.900]   Okay, that's the one you're gonna be remembered for.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.980]   You're not gonna be remembered
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.740]   for the battle you lost on Tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:29.860]   in some nameless gym with some guy that no one cares about.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.400]   No one's gonna remember that.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.620]   You're gonna be remembered for your peak performances,
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.500]   not your everyday performances.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.700]   Focus your everyday performances on skill development
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.540]   so that your peak performances, you can focus on winning.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:45.460]   - This is not a therapy session,
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.780]   but if I could just speak.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.620]   - Every session's a therapy session.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:56.660]   - There is still an ape thing in there.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.620]   - Of course, you think I don't feel it?
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.180]   You think everyone in the room doesn't feel it?
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.280]   Because, for example, you haven't ever seen me roll.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.540]   When there's people, I've seen the look in people's eyes
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.500]   when they see me train and I could see,
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.220]   maybe it's me projecting, but they think,
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.860]   I thought you were supposed to be good.
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.020]   I thought you were supposed to be a black belt.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.580]   That look, they're like--
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.860]   - I'm gonna give you some therapy.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.900]   - Okay. (laughs)
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.380]   - Do you know how many people
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.580]   have come up to me over the years
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:39.140]   who have visited the training halls that I work in
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:39.980]   and they come up to me and they go,
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.820]   man, I rolled with Gary Tonin.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:48.500]   I did really well with him, like really well.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.900]   I'm like, oh, that's very good, very impressive.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.140]   And then I see them talking to their friends,
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:57.220]   I'm like, man, I tapped out Gary Tonin.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.020]   And I'm sitting there going, yeah.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.980]   And you can see that they're just like,
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:10.020]   whoa, dude, I'm way better than I thought I was.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.060]   Gary Tonin, all of my students,
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:19.220]   I push them in the direction of giving up bad positions
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.580]   so that they practice working,
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.140]   getting out of critical situations.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.220]   It's a huge part of our training program.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.300]   But Gary Tonin takes that to a level
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.340]   that just no one else even gets close.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.420]   It's just amazing.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.460]   Like he will put himself in impossible situations
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:38.420]   where it's a fully locked strangle,
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.260]   a hundred percent on with both his arms behind his back.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.820]   And he'll try to work out from there.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.580]   And seven times out of 10, he does.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.700]   But three times out of 10, he gets caught.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:55.860]   I'm a huge advocate of handicap training
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.660]   where you handicap yourself to work on skills.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:02.860]   He's took that to heart to a level
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.660]   that few people, I believe, can match.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.980]   - I just wonder what his psychology is like because there's--
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.420]   - It goes back to what we talked about before, Lex.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.620]   You have to understand it's skill development.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.260]   Don't take it personally.
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.060]   I understand.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.380]   I hear where you're coming from.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.900]   We've all got what you call the ape reflex
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.700]   where we wanna be dominant, okay?
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.740]   We all do.
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.700]   - 'Cause there's thousands of white belts out there
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.780]   that have tapped Gary Tonin.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.620]   - Yes.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.460]   - And they're walking around and they're posting online.
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.820]   - They're saying, "Dude, I tapped Gary Tonin."
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.420]   Like Gary Tonin's like one of the best in the world.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.380]   So I'm one of the best in the world.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.220]   And does Gary get upset about this?
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.100]   No, of course not.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.420]   'Cause Gary knows that when it counts on stage,
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.260]   he's gonna be going a hundred percent
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.580]   with a set of skills that very few people can match.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:52.340]   He can go into an EBI overtime
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.620]   at the 205 pound weight division
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.380]   against an 80 CC champion,
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.580]   starting in a full arm lock position
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:04.700]   and effortlessly get out with no problems in seconds.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.940]   Because he's been in that situation 25,000 times
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:12.780]   with varying degrees of skill opponents.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.140]   And there's just no panic, no fear.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:20.260]   He's just doing what he's done so many thousands of times.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.220]   And that's a fine, fine example of a guy
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.740]   who didn't give a damn what happened in the training room.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:30.580]   But when it counted on the stage in front of the cameras,
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.140]   it kicked in.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:35.380]   - Yeah, he's an incredible inspiration actually.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.380]   He's a practitioner of something you've recently
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.380]   talked quite a bit about,
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:43.180]   which is the power of escaping sort of bad positions.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.340]   I think you've talked about it,
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.900]   which is really interesting framing,
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.900]   is escaping bad positions is one of the best ways,
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.740]   if not the best way to demonstrate dominance
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:01.340]   psychologically over your opponent.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.020]   That anything they throw at you,
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:07.380]   like their weapons are useless against you.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.260]   - There's a little bit of Lex Friedman
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.740]   kicking through on this question.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:16.740]   Your obsession with dominance is skewing you.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.060]   - It's a therapy session.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.380]   It's a therapy session.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.420]   I'm coming from a wrestling perspective.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.980]   I think it's not just Lex Friedman.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.020]   I think it's Dan Gable.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.860]   I think it's dominant.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.740]   The Gary Tonin ethic,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.300]   it just goes against everything wrestling is about.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.580]   You never put yourself in a bad position.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.980]   And the fact, it's a,
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.740]   philosophically, I don't know what to do with it.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:45.700]   It's a total reframing of showing dominance
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:49.060]   by escaping any bad position.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.140]   - Yeah, let's talk about the idea of
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.540]   what is the value of escape?
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.820]   Why do I put this in as the first skill
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.820]   that every Jiu-Jitsu student must master?
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.380]   Believe it or not,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.380]   when I talked about how it
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:11.380]   pertains to dominance, that's its smallest value.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:14.980]   Its greatest value has nothing to do with dominance.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.500]   It has to do with confidence.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:22.540]   You can train someone and teach them technique
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:24.260]   until you're blue in the face.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:29.340]   But at some point, the athlete in question
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.900]   has to go out there on the stage
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.740]   and pull the trigger when the time is right.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:40.220]   What's gonna give you that ability
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:44.620]   to go from the physical skills that you've learned
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.420]   to execution under pressure is confidence.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.580]   (inhales)
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:56.820]   I always talk about skill development,
[00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:59.980]   and yes, skill development is the absolute bedrock
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.380]   of my training programs.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:07.740]   But you can't finish at that level.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.020]   There has to be something more than that.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.460]   And you have to go from the physical element of skill
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.460]   into the psychological element of confidence.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.100]   I can teach you an armbar all day.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.980]   You can get to a point where you can flawlessly execute
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.980]   armbars in drilling and even in a certain level
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.900]   of competition.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:32.940]   But if you believe that in attempting an armbar
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.260]   on a dangerous opponent with good guard passing skills,
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.940]   say the armbar is being performed from guard position,
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:45.460]   that if the armbar fails and your opponent uses that failure
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.380]   to set up a strong pass and get into a side pin,
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.020]   possibly into the mount,
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.300]   and you don't have the ability to get out of that side pin
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:58.380]   or mount, you won't pull the trigger on the armbar.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.460]   And so even though you had all the requisite physical skills
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.140]   to perform the technique, when push came to shove
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:09.860]   and the critical moment came, you backed down.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.100]   You didn't pull the trigger.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.740]   Building that confidence is the key
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.900]   to championship performance.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:24.740]   And the single best way to do it is to take away
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:29.540]   the innate fear that we all have of bad outcomes
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:33.340]   that makes us naturally risk averse.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.860]   When you don't believe you can be pinned,
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.260]   when you don't believe your guard can be passed,
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.220]   you'll take risks because there's no downside
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.660]   to your actions.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.140]   An unpinnable person and an unpassable person
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.820]   doesn't have much to fear in a jujitsu match.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.700]   You can come out and fire with all guns blazing
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.340]   because then you know at the end of the day,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.540]   no one's gonna hold you down,
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.460]   no one's gonna pass your guard.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.900]   That's your first two goals in jujitsu.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.500]   They're the most boring goals.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.620]   They're not exciting to learn.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.620]   No one wants to come in and they're first and be told,
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.780]   okay, you're gonna practice escapes
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.140]   for the next year of your life.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.300]   Okay, it's a goal, are you kidding me?
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.900]   But that's what you gotta have.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.420]   That's your first skill.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.140]   And that's what I push upon all of my students.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.220]   You'll see almost all of them
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.700]   are very, very strong in escape skills.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.100]   They know that if things go wrong,
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.780]   they can always get out.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.020]   They can always live to fight another day.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:28.360]   And that is what gives them the ability
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.040]   to attack without fear.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.760]   I think that it's so profound and so rare.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.740]   It's so rare to hear this.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.540]   I think it's because it's the most painful thing to do.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.060]   Always ask yourself,
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:46.660]   when you enter a jujitsu match,
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.260]   you already know ahead of time
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:55.500]   if you're going to lose, how you're going to lose.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.860]   Okay, there's only a certain number of realistic submissions
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.060]   that work in the sport of jujitsu.
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:03.220]   The number is very small.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:06.460]   So ahead of time, you already know
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.780]   the most likely methods of submission loss in jujitsu
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.460]   are going to be things like heel hook,
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.660]   armbar, renegade strangle, guillotine, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.420]   Just work backwards from that knowledge.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.500]   So start off learning how to defend all of those things.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   You know what the major losing positions are in jujitsu.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.260]   Someone gets mounted on you, rear mount,
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.620]   side control, knee on belly.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.780]   Those are positions you can only lose from.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.260]   So work backwards from there,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.020]   getting out of those positions.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.780]   And that's how I always start.
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.460]   I always say with my students,
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:40.260]   I teach beginners from the ground up
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.140]   and I teach experts backwards.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.260]   What does that mean?
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.100]   When a young student comes to me with no skills,
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.500]   they learn from the ground up.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.300]   They start on their backs, defending pins.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.220]   Then they start on their backs,
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.740]   working from half guard bottom,
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.460]   then on their backs, working from variations of guard.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.340]   They don't even get the seat top position
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.780]   until they're strong off their backs.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.420]   Then they go onto their knees and they start passing,
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.580]   start standing and passing.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.180]   And then they work their pins and transitions.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.180]   And then ultimately they stand up to their feet
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.660]   and they work standing position on their feet.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.740]   So they work from ground back on the floor
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.620]   to ground knees on the floor,
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.660]   ground standing, and then both athletes standing.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.260]   It's a gradual progression over time
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.940]   where they work from the bottom to the top.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.460]   With regards experts, I teach them in game first.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.380]   They must become very, very strong
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.500]   in what finishes the match, which is submission holds.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.540]   Okay?
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.940]   In chess, we always talk about end game.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.620]   I do the same thing in jiu-jitsu.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.380]   I start experts just looking at the mechanics
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.300]   of breaking people and all the submission holds that I teach.
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.980]   You should know that I teach only
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:57.020]   a very small number of submission holds, around six.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.180]   It's interesting.
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.460]   My students have by far and away the highest submission rate
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.620]   in contemporary jiu-jitsu,
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.460]   but they only learn around six to seven submission holds.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:13.960]   I start them with mechanics where they learn the end game,
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.180]   how to break someone.
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:24.860]   Once they develop in their mind the belief that if,
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.180]   the conditional if, they can get
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.020]   to one of those six positions,
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.560]   there's a very high likelihood they'll win.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:42.580]   If they truly believe then, when it's competition time,
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.260]   they'll fucking find a way to get to those positions.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.860]   - That's confidence.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.420]   - But if you don't believe, let's say you believe,
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.060]   man, if I get to a finishing position,
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.020]   an armbar or a strangle,
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.180]   there's only like a 20% chance I'll finish with it.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.820]   How hard are you gonna fight to get to that position?
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.100]   You're not.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:00.940]   Why?
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.260]   Why would you?
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.920]   But if you believe there's a 98% chance,
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.180]   if you get to that position, you'll finish.
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.740]   You'll find a way to get there.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.100]   - That is so powerful.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.500]   There's certain things,
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.140]   and maybe going back to judo a little bit,
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:20.140]   is there's a clock choke for people who are listening.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:25.260]   It's with the gi, when a person is in a turtle position
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.380]   and a crouching position,
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:30.300]   this is something that's done in judo quite a bit.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.580]   But I have, it doesn't matter what the technique is,
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.300]   I have a belief in my head
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.600]   that there's not a person in the world
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.500]   that I can't choke with that clock choke.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.620]   - That's a good belief to have.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.740]   - And I've done that, and that it was,
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.980]   it built on itself.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.320]   The belief made the technique better and better and better.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.220]   - Now you're onto something.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.780]   - That's exactly the mindset that I'm trying to coach.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.960]   - But that's step one.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.740]   You have to believe that--
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.740]   - But you gotta start somewhere.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.860]   - And then-- - That's step one.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.060]   - But then you have to create a system--
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.960]   - But it's a damn important step.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.980]   So you coach the end game first,
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.700]   and then you fill in the details afterwards.
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.340]   - Yeah, that's a huge confidence builder,
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.940]   but I just, I have to say, to admit,
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.940]   and it makes me sad, but I think I'm not alone.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.100]   I think a majority of Jiu-Jitsu people are like this,
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:27.900]   that I didn't do the beginner step that you talk about,
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.780]   which is focusing on escapes.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:35.740]   I think I learned the wrong lessons from being, from losing.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.460]   I remember in a blue belt competition long ago,
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:44.460]   when I was, I think it was, yeah,
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.720]   it was the finals of Atlanta IBJJF tournament,
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.920]   and there's a person that passed my guard,
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.560]   and he took mount, and he stayed in mount for a long time,
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:04.440]   and I couldn't breathe, and it was like one of those things
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   where I was truly dominated.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.040]   I don't think I've been dominated in a Jiu-Jitsu match
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.560]   quite like that before or after,
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.960]   and the lesson I learned from that is I'm not gonna let,
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.120]   like, as opposed to working on escapes,
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.240]   I'm not gonna let anyone pass my guard.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.480]   - What you learned is don't take risks.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.480]   - Don't take risks. - Yeah.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.640]   Which is ultimately what kills you.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.360]   Ultimately, if you become the best you can,
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.400]   you gotta take risks.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   As they say, nothing risk, nothing gain.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   Failure usually makes us even more risk-averse
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.240]   than we started.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.300]   We're already mentally biased,
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.360]   being human beings in that direction,
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.680]   and failure tends to reinforce that.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.260]   I work hard in my training programs
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.600]   to try and correct that fault.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.280]   - Is it still possible for a person who's a black belt
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.960]   to then just go back to that beginning journey, I guess?
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.800]   - Of course.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.120]   Let me tell you something.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.720]   I'm probably gonna catch a lot of flack for saying this.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.760]   I have a belief.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.000]   I won't say something, I won't call it knowledge
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.600]   'cause it's not known, but I have a fervent belief
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.040]   that human beings in most skill activities,
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.960]   not all skill activities, but I will say combat sports
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.240]   for sure, can reinvent themselves in five-year periods.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.240]   Now, you might be saying five years?
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.840]   What's magical about five years?
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:36.360]   Mike Tyson was 13 years old
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.160]   when he was taken in by custom auto.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.920]   By the age of 18, he was beating
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.600]   world-class boxers in the gym
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.280]   and had already made a strong name for himself
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.640]   in international boxing.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.320]   He was already a known figure.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.360]   It was five years.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:02.840]   Yasuhiro Yamashita, the judo player,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.800]   began judo at 13.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:11.260]   He placed silver in the All Japans at 17.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.260]   I could go on all day with examples of athletes
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:24.060]   who within a five-year timeframe of starting a sport
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.980]   were competing at world championship level.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:30.620]   I'm gonna give you a rough and ready definition
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.660]   of sport mastery, okay?
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:37.660]   I believe that if you can play a competitive match
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.820]   against someone ranked in the top 25 in your sport,
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.240]   and it's a serious international sport,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.480]   I would call you someone who's mastered that sport.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.240]   Okay, you're damn good.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.200]   If you can go with the number 25 wrestler in the world
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.440]   and give them a hard competitive match in the gym,
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.800]   you may not win it, but they had a good workout,
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.200]   you have shown mastery of wrestling
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.120]   or indeed any other combat sport you care to name.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.720]   There are numerous examples of people doing far better
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   than that in five years, winning medals
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.080]   at world championships and even Olympic games
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.320]   in that five-year period.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.160]   This is not an unrealistic goal.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160]   There is a lot of empirical evidence to show
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.760]   that people have done this in the past, a lot of it.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.420]   So if you fully immerse yourself in a sport
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.140]   with a well-worked out, well-planned training program,
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.860]   there is a mountain of evidence to show
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.600]   that in a five-year period, you can go from
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.900]   a complete beginner to a very, very impressive skill level
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:54.360]   to the point where you're competitive
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.420]   with some of the best people on the planet.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.520]   You can reinvent yourself in these five-year periods.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.120]   What happens with most people is they get to a certain level
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.360]   and they get complacent, they get lazy,
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.160]   and they just keep doing the same old thing
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.400]   they've been doing.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.560]   But if you're diligent and you're purposeful,
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.680]   five years, you can accomplish an awful lot.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.040]   And as I said, there's a mountain of evidence to show it.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.640]   - By the way, as a small aside,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.960]   somebody who's mentioned Tversky and Yamashita
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.800]   in the same conversation, you're one of the most
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.160]   impressive people I've ever spoken to.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:32.160]   But as a small aside, so if there's this complete beginner,
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.240]   this is really interesting.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:40.320]   There is empirical evidence that you can achieve
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.680]   incredible things in a short amount of time.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.960]   There's a complete beginner standing before you
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.560]   and that beginner has fire in their eyes
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.700]   and they want to achieve mastery.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:58.120]   Where do you place most of the credit
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.560]   for a journey that does achieve mastery?
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.760]   Is it the set of ideas they have in their mind?
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.360]   Is it the set of drills or the way they practice?
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.600]   Is it genetics and luck?
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.040]   - Those are all good insights.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.040]   All of those factors you've mentioned play a definite role.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.680]   Let's start with luck, okay?
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.960]   We are all subject to fortune,
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.600]   and fortune can be good and fortune can be bad.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.120]   Life is in many ways beautiful, but life is also tragic.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.360]   And I've had students who showed enormous promise
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.720]   and just tragic events occurred in their lives.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.200]   The vicissitudes of fortune can be
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.120]   a wonderful thing in your life
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.760]   and they can be a terrible tragedy.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.400]   I've had students who died for various reasons
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.540]   who could have gone on to become world champions.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:59.360]   I've had students who, on a much lighter note,
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.920]   just fell in love and just wanted to have kids and move away.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.040]   And that's a wonderful thing, but different direction.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.960]   You just never know.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.520]   So luck does play some role.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.920]   Even things like where you're born,
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.760]   the location of your physical location in the world,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.320]   or even the socioeconomic location can play a role,
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.800]   which could be detrimental or favorable.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.720]   So yeah, luck does play some role.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.760]   Thankfully, it's one of the smaller elements.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.320]   And I do believe that a truly resourceful mind
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.080]   can overcome the majority of what fortune throws at us
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.120]   and get to goals, provided you're sufficiently
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.180]   mentally robust.
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:49.240]   Other things you mentioned, genetics.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:53.880]   I do believe in certain sports,
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.480]   genetics really do play a powerful, powerful role.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.800]   For example, in any sport where power output
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.720]   and reaction speed, ability to take physical damage,
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.160]   then there are genetic elements which will help.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.360]   For example, I couldn't imagine a world
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.440]   in which even if I have a crippled leg,
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.080]   so even if I grew up in a world where my leg was normal
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.200]   and I had normal legs and everything was fine with my body,
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   I don't believe that I could win the Olympic gold medal
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.160]   in 100 meter sprinting, for example.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.640]   Okay, I just don't have enough fast twitch muscle fibers.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   But the more a sport involves skill and tactics,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.840]   the less you will see genetics playing a role.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.340]   If you look at the medal podiums in jujitsu, for example,
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:52.320]   you will see that no one body type
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.840]   is definitively superior to another.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.400]   You will see every variation of body type
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.740]   in the medal platforms in jujitsu.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.960]   As skill and tactics become more and more important
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.220]   and things like just power output over time
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.060]   become less and less important,
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:11.480]   then you will see that genetics
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.840]   play less and less of a role.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.560]   I'm happy to say that the sport of jujitsu,
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.200]   the evidence seems pretty clear
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.080]   that there's no one dominant body type
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:19.920]   in the sport of jujitsu.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.880]   Rather, there's just advantages for one type
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.400]   and there's advantages for another.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.200]   You just have to learn to tailor your game to your body.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.640]   With regards to training program,
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.680]   yes, I believe with all my heart and all my soul
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.160]   that your training program does make a difference.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.500]   I've dedicated my life to that.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.860]   Obviously, I'm biased in this regard.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:47.700]   I do believe that all of the students that I taught
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.120]   who became world champions would have been great athletes,
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.800]   whether or not they had met me or not.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.040]   I believe that.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.960]   But I do also believe it would have taken them a lot longer
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.040]   and they may not have gotten to the level that they did.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.860]   I'm sure they would have been impressive,
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:06.060]   but I do believe that the nature of a training program
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.240]   plays an enormous difference.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.920]   I don't mean to say this in an arrogant way.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.200]   I believe that there's, again, a mountain of evidence
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.680]   to suggest this is true
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.860]   because you see it in many different sports.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:21.720]   Let's talk, for example, about your country, Russia,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.080]   and its wrestling program.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.660]   Russia is an enormous country,
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:32.880]   but the location where Russia's wrestling program comes from
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.140]   is actually very small,
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.820]   and the population is actually very small.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.580]   I can't verify this, but I was told once,
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:40.680]   I can't verify this,
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.860]   but the number of people who wrestle in Russia
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.940]   is actually significantly smaller
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.820]   than the number of people who wrestle in the United States.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:51.540]   - It's also not part of the school athletics
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.940]   and it is in the United States.
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.660]   - Yes, that's a different point.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:55.500]   We'll come back to that
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.760]   'cause that's also an important point.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.300]   But if you look at the actual numbers of people there,
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.060]   they're actually pretty small.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.660]   So ostensibly, if it comes down to a numbers game,
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.420]   America should dominate at the Olympics
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.820]   if we have more wrestlers.
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.860]   Now, the story gets more complicated
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.260]   because America has a different style of wrestling,
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.460]   the collegiate style, than the international freestyle.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.300]   That is a complicating factor.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:21.780]   But nonetheless, what you see there
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.260]   is that numbers aren't everything.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:27.660]   Rather, the manner in which people are trained
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.460]   clearly has an impact.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.820]   And we know very little about the,
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.540]   there's very little reliable information
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.540]   about the training program for wrestling
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.340]   in the Russian states.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:43.140]   But one thing is incontestable is the amount of success
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.900]   that they've had at an international world championship
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.560]   and Olympic competition.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:52.140]   They are disproportionately successful
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.780]   despite their relatively small numbers.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.940]   There's nothing genetically special about them.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:01.140]   You can talk about performance enhancing drugs,
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.460]   but those are a worldwide phenomenon.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.100]   They don't have any access to technology
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.060]   that the rest of the world doesn't have.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:11.900]   At some point, you gotta start asking
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.420]   what are they doing differently in the training room?
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:18.100]   And there are many other examples
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.220]   of similar situations.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.660]   My country, New Zealand,
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:27.820]   has an insanely successful rugby program,
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.580]   the sport of rugby,
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:34.580]   which they have dominated for literally generations,
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.700]   despite the fact that our population is very, very small
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.900]   compared with the rest of the country.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.580]   And we don't excel in many other sports.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.900]   New Zealand does fairly well in sports overall,
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.900]   but nothing like they do in rugby.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.700]   And you gotta ask yourself,
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:54.260]   is there a culture there which built this up?
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.900]   And the world is full of examples
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:01.900]   of seemingly small and unpromising areas or locations
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.780]   putting out disproportionately high numbers
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.260]   of successful athletes.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:10.500]   And that points to the idea
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.380]   that different training programs
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.380]   have different success rates.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.660]   And so I truly believe with all my heart and all my soul
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:22.180]   that how you train does make a significant difference.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.900]   I would even go further and say it makes the most difference.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.980]   Is it the only thing?
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.820]   Absolutely not.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.060]   We've already talked about fortune.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.420]   We've talked about genetics.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.740]   If you wanna get nasty,
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.100]   you can even talk about things like performance
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:36.100]   enhancing drugs that obviously plays a role in modern sports.
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:42.140]   But I do believe that the majority
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:46.540]   of what creates success
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.660]   is the interaction between the athlete
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.340]   and the training program.
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.340]   Now the training program is one thing.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.420]   I do believe that's the single most important,
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.280]   but right behind it is the athlete themselves.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   In my own experience,
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.180]   people talk about athletes that I've trained successfully,
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.420]   but they never talk about athletes
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.060]   that I've trained unsuccessfully.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:11.340]   Always remember that for every champion a coach produces,
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:14.300]   there's a hundred people that they coach
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.020]   that no one ever heard of.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.860]   And this is completely normal.
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:24.020]   A coach can never take the lion's share of the credit.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.620]   A coach creates possibilities,
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:31.380]   but it's the athlete who actualizes the possibilities.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:33.260]   And so building that rapport
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.460]   and finding the right people to excel
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.380]   in your training program is also a big part of it.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.300]   - What makes the difference between the successful,
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.580]   your successes and your failures as a coach?
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.020]   - A range of reasons.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.740]   The single most important is persistence.
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:55.340]   People will point to all kinds of virtues amongst athletes.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.500]   This guy's the most courageous,
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.980]   this guy's the strongest, these are all virtues.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:04.980]   But the one indispensable virtue is persistence.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.460]   The ability just to stay in the game long enough
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.380]   to get the results you seek.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:12.660]   - But what does persistence really look like?
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.420]   If we can just break that apart a little bit.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.020]   - It's actually, and this is a great question you're asking,
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:21.220]   because most people see it as a kind of simplistic
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.740]   doggedness where you just show up every day.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:24.760]   That's not it.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.740]   The most important form of persistence
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:30.460]   is persistence of thinking,
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:34.660]   which looks to push you in increasingly efficient,
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:38.060]   more and more efficient methods of training.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.260]   Famously, people talk about the idea
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.700]   that the hardest work of all is hard thinking,
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.460]   and they're absolutely right.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.500]   Okay, coming into the gym and just doing the same thing
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.280]   for a decade isn't going to make you better.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.740]   What's going to make you better
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.820]   is progressive training over time
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.340]   where you identify clear goals marked out
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.900]   in time increments, three months, six months,
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.280]   12 months, five years,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.380]   and build those short-term goals
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.580]   into a program of long-term goals,
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:10.860]   making sure that the training program changes over time
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.560]   so that as your skill level rises,
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.820]   the challenges you face in the gym become higher and higher.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.500]   Don't kill them at the start with challenges
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.720]   that are too hard for them to deal with.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.500]   They get discouraged and leave.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.340]   Build them slowly over time,
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.860]   but make sure they don't just get left in a swamp
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.100]   where they're just doing the same thing
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.820]   they were doing three years ago, and they get bored.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.300]   There's two ways you can leave in a gym.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:36.140]   You can leave from adversity, it was too tough,
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:38.220]   or you can leave from boredom.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.840]   Everyone talks about the first.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.420]   No one talks about the second.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:47.500]   Most people, when they get to black belt, they get bored.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.620]   They know what their game is.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.620]   They know what they're good at.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.220]   They know what they're not good at.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.420]   When they compete, they stick with what they're good at,
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.820]   and they avoid what they're not good at, and they get bored.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.500]   They reach a plateau, and that's it.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.380]   My whole thing is to make sure it's not so tough
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.180]   at the start that they leave because of adversity,
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.420]   and then for the rest of their career,
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.700]   to make sure it's not boring,
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.100]   so they leave because of boredom.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.700]   - Travis Dean has actually said something
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.840]   that changed the way I see training.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.540]   He said it as a side comment,
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.940]   but he said that at the end of a good training session,
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.460]   your mind should be exhausted, not your body.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:29.220]   And I, for most of my life, saw good training sessions
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.300]   where my body was exhausted.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.180]   - Yes, I believe that's the case with most people.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.140]   You should come out of the training session
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.260]   with your mind buzzing with ideas,
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.540]   like possibilities for tomorrow.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.620]   And by the way, on that note, I would go further
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.780]   and say that the training session doesn't finish
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.680]   when your body stops moving.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.180]   It finishes when your mind stops moving,
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.180]   and your mind shouldn't stop moving.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.140]   After that session, there should be analysis.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:55.980]   What did I do well?
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:57.300]   What did I do badly?
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.260]   How could I do better with the things that I did well?
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:03.660]   - Can I ask you about something that I truly enjoy
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.700]   and I think is really powerful,
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.640]   but most people don't seem to believe in that,
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.740]   but is drilling?
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.580]   I don't know.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:15.420]   Maybe people are different, but I love the idea,
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.860]   maybe even outside of Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:19.460]   of doing the same thing over and over.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.700]   It's like Jiro dreams of sushi.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.700]   I love doing the thing that nobody wants to do
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.980]   and doing it 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 times more
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:32.900]   than what nobody wants to do.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:36.900]   So I'm a huge fan of drilling.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.700]   Obviously, I'm not a professional athlete,
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.220]   but I feel like if I actually gave myself,
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.420]   if I wanted to be really good at Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:47.500]   like reach the level of being in the top 25
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.320]   when I was much younger, like really strive,
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   I think I could achieve it by drilling.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.120]   I had this belief untested.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.680]   Can you challenge this idea?
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:03.320]   Or agree with it?
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.400]   - First off, fascinating.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.240]   However, we're going to have to-
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.060]   - Disagree?
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:08.900]   - No, no.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:13.280]   We're just going to have to start to understand
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.580]   what are we talking about when we talk about drilling.
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:17.100]   It's a very vague term.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.640]   Okay, at this moment, many of your listeners
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.000]   are probably having the same thought process,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.880]   which is, oh, drilling, yeah, I know what that is.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.600]   We go into the gym and we pick a move
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.360]   and we practice it for a certain number of repetitions.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.240]   And if I do that, I'm going to get better at the technique.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:44.880]   They're wrong.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   We've got to have a much more in-depth understanding
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.680]   of what the hell we're talking about
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.080]   when we talk about drilling.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:03.440]   Ultimately, any movement in the gym
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:08.720]   that doesn't improve the skills you already have
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.880]   or build new skills is a waste of time,
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.480]   a waste of resources.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.520]   Everything you do should be done with the aim
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.320]   and the understanding that this is going to make me better
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.960]   at the sport I practice.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.620]   If it's not, shouldn't be there.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:28.680]   The majority of what passes for drilling
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.460]   in most training halls will not make you better,
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:35.920]   including some of the most cherished forms of drilling,
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.020]   which is repetition for numbers.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.440]   The moment you say to someone,
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   I want you to do this 100 times,
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.960]   what are they really thinking about?
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.780]   Volume.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:52.240]   They're saying, okay, I'm at repetition 78.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.380]   I'm at 80, 20 more to go.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.220]   All they're talking,
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.680]   their primary thought process is on numbers.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.240]   That's not the point of drilling.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.140]   The point is skill acquisition.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:09.680]   When people drill, don't get them focused on numbers.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.740]   Get them focused on mechanics.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.260]   That's what they have to worry about.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:17.780]   I never have my students drill for numbers ever.
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.060]   This one, two, three, get the fuck out of here.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:21.900]   Are you kidding me?
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.580]   Like, how are you going to get better with that?
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:28.220]   Okay, get them working on the sense of gaining knowledge.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.060]   That's my job.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.620]   I have to give them knowledge.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:34.180]   I have to explain to them what they're trying to do.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.860]   That starts them on the right track.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.280]   But knowledge is one thing, skill is another.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.980]   If jiu-jitsu was just about knowledge,
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:47.980]   then all the 60 and 70 year old red belts
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.200]   would be the world champions.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.460]   They're not.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:53.860]   Jiu-jitsu isn't won by knowledge, it's won by skill.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:58.180]   Knowledge is the first step in building skill.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.980]   So my job as a coach is to transmit knowledge.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.700]   Then I have to create training programs
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:08.460]   where the path from knowledge to polished skill
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.260]   is carried out.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:13.780]   That's the interface between me and my students.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:18.780]   And so I give them drills where the whole emphasis
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:23.700]   is upon getting a sense where they understand
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.580]   what are the problems they're trying to solve
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.580]   and working towards practical solutions.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.820]   They never work with numbers.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.080]   They work with mechanics and feel.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.240]   Then you have to bring in the idea of progression.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.840]   When you drill, there's zero resistance.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.960]   When you fight in competition, there's 100% resistance.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.280]   You can't go from zero to 100.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.000]   There has to be progress over time
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.200]   where I have them work in drills
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   with slightly increasing increments of resistance.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.660]   And just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.880]   who doesn't start with 500 pounds,
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.880]   but who begins with the bar,
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.040]   and then over time builds the skills
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.720]   that one day out there in the future
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.740]   he will lift 500 pounds.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.920]   So too, that Judy Guittami that you're working on today
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.700]   is feeble and pathetic.
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.760]   But five years from now,
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.760]   you'll win a world championship with it.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:28.640]   You can't have this naive idea of drilling
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.360]   as something you just come out,
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:33.120]   you randomly pick a move,
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.800]   and you work for numbers until you've satisfied
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.760]   a certain set of numbers that your coach threw at you,
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.760]   and then you think you're gonna get better.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.640]   There's even dangers with drilling.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:50.120]   There is no performance increase
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:54.480]   that comes once you get to a certain level,
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.240]   and you just keep doing the same damn thing.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:01.660]   Let's say, for example, you come out
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.120]   and you hit 100 repetitions of the arm bar
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.740]   Judy Guittami from guard position,
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.880]   and you're all proud of yourself
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.160]   'cause you hit 100 repetitions,
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.000]   and your body's tired, and you're telling yourself,
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   "Man, I got a good workout."
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.360]   And you come in tomorrow, you do exactly the same thing.
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.600]   You come in the day after that,
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.100]   and a week goes by and you've done the same thing.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.360]   Then a year later, you do the same thing.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:28.820]   Ask yourself, has your Judy Guittami really gotten better?
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:32.520]   No, you've performed literally thousands
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.320]   and thousands of repetitions.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.680]   You have spent an enormous amount of training time
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:43.120]   and energy that could have gone in different directions
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.600]   on something which didn't make you any better.
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:51.880]   Drills have diminishing returns.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.040]   Once you get to a certain skill level,
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.120]   if you just keep hammering on the same thing
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.160]   in the same fashion for the same amount of time,
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.360]   you stop getting better.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.600]   - Can I, partially for fun, partially for dollars,
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.360]   I love it, but partially because I actually believe
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.040]   this to push back on some points.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.080]   Is it possible?
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.640]   So everything you said I think is beautiful and correct.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:19.720]   But the asking yourself the question,
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.400]   am I getting better is a really important one,
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.280]   and you could do that in training.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.160]   Is there a set of techniques,
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.080]   maybe a small subset of all the techniques
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.720]   that are in jiu-jitsu,
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.560]   where you can have significant skill acquisition
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:39.080]   if you put in the numbers or the time, whatever,
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.240]   on a technique against an opponent who's not resisting?
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.120]   Here's, let me elaborate.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.160]   What I've, in my, maybe I'm different.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.800]   - You'll probably have to finish an example.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.620]   - Yes.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:53.000]   Let me first make a general statement,
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.660]   then I can give examples.
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:58.000]   The general statement is I found that through repetitions,
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.840]   and this is high repetitions combined with training,
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:05.120]   but high repetitions against a non-resisting opponent,
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:10.120]   I've gotten to understand the way my body moves,
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.760]   the way I apply pressure on a human.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.520]   'Cause it's not actually zero resistance.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.120]   The opponent's still laying there.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.040]   They're still keeping their legs up.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.620]   They're still doing, they might not be resisting,
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:22.560]   but they're still creating a structure.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.400]   - Yes.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.760]   - A non-dynamic structure.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.080]   - They're presenting a target.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.920]   - Yes, it's not dynamic,
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:32.000]   so you can't master the timing of things,
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.800]   but you can master the, not master,
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.800]   but I felt like I could gain an understanding
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.040]   of how to apply pressure to the human body
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.200]   over thousands of repetitions.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.400]   Now, for example, just to give you an example
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.280]   to know what we're talking about,
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:52.200]   there's a guy named Salo Hubero and Shonji Hubero
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.240]   that have this, I guess, I already forgot,
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.640]   but headquarters position or something like that.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.040]   But putting pressure as you pass guard,
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.500]   like medium passing distance kind of pressure.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.040]   I've did thousands of repetitions of that
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.040]   to understand what putting pressure with my hips feels like,
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.980]   to truly understand that movement.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.640]   I felt like I was getting much better.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.520]   It's like, it's hard to put into words,
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.740]   but that skill acquisition is so subtle.
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.520]   Just the way you turn your little, like hips.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.200]   - But you're already talking about
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.800]   a better form of drilling now.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.520]   You're going beyond the basic numbers
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.480]   and you're getting the sense of feel and mechanics,
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.020]   which is what we want in drilling.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.120]   - But the reason I say numbers,
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.480]   and maybe you can speak to this,
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.800]   but this might be an OCD thing,
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.320]   but it allows you to take a journey
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.320]   that doesn't just last a week or two weeks,
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.000]   but a journey where you stay with the technique
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.760]   for two, three years, and there's a dedication to it,
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.040]   where it's a long-term commitment,
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.000]   to where you're forcing yourself,
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.400]   perhaps there's other mechanisms,
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.280]   but you're forcing yourself to stay with a technique
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.000]   longer than most people around you
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.120]   are staying with whatever they're working on.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.120]   And you're taking that long journey.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.360]   And the numbers somehow enforce that persistence
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.480]   and that dedication.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:18.320]   - First thing, that journey's a wonderful thing.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:22.980]   And if that technique is a crucial part of what you do,
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.720]   then it's time well invested.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.520]   But always understand that it comes at an opportunity cost,
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.360]   that by spending that amount of time on that one technique,
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.680]   you've sacrificed other things
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.980]   that you could have learned that could have won you matches.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:39.980]   So understand that every focus upon one element of the game
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:43.220]   comes at the opportunity cost of other elements.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.600]   Now, as long as you're playing a part of the game
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.720]   where, okay, this is central to what I do, okay, that's fine.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.700]   But just be aware of the danger of opportunity cost.
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.460]   That's something no one talks about in the training room,
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.540]   but it becomes very important.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.300]   Secondly, the other question you have to start asking
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:03.880]   yourself is, okay, that training clearly had benefits
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.820]   for you early on.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.620]   But when the point of diminishing return starts coming,
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.060]   and if you feel you're just doing the same thing,
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.300]   then it's time to switch.
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:15.300]   Now, if you feel you're still getting benefit from it,
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.300]   by all means, continue.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.940]   That will be a call on your part.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.600]   You've been playing this game a long time now,
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.380]   so I would trust your call on that.
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:28.640]   But my job as a coach is to look out and say,
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.740]   okay, this kid's been working cross-ashigurami
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.780]   for six months, and I feel he's gotten
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.280]   to a good skill level.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.100]   If he stays any further on it,
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:43.020]   the opportunity cost becomes greater
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.860]   than the expected benefits of continuing it.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.100]   And that's my job as a coach,
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.540]   is to direct things in that fashion.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.340]   If I can do a good job with that,
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:52.820]   then I can take them to the next level of drilling
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.380]   and start amping it up,
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.780]   and that's how I keep progress over time.
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:01.780]   My biggest fear is to have students run past the point
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:05.340]   of diminishing returns, staying stagnant,
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:07.960]   where opportunity cost comes in,
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.620]   and they're not making the progress they could
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:13.260]   in the time that they've been working.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.740]   - And that was, it was almost a philosophical question
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.100]   for me, that's what I was always on the search on,
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:22.540]   'cause I know my mind likes drilling.
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:26.580]   I don't like relying on other people for improvement.
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:30.660]   And drilling allows me to do something
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.700]   that is 100% me.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.460]   - It's interesting, Lex, you say you don't like relying
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.460]   on other people in drilling, but in drilling,
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.300]   you really do rely a lot on your partner.
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.940]   One of the first things I do when I coach people
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:43.220]   is I teach them how to drill.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:44.900]   That's a skill in itself.
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:49.900]   And drilling is, in a sense, the opposite of sparring.
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:55.780]   Drilling is a cooperative venture
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.460]   where you work as dance partners,
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.260]   complementing each other's movement.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.300]   If I drill with Gordon Ryan and I want him to work armbars,
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.900]   I will move my body in ways
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.560]   which make it an interesting exercise for Gordon.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:15.580]   I'm not just sitting there and he does a repetition
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.740]   and I'm, okay, he does 10.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:20.900]   I can't wait for this to be over so I can do my 10
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:22.260]   and I can't wait for all this to be over
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:25.620]   so we can just spar and get over with all this bullshit.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.500]   That's the sad truth of most drilling in jiu-jitsu.
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:33.380]   There's a sense in which when good people drill,
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:36.940]   it's like watching good people dance.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.820]   They move in unison and complement each other's movement
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.420]   and make each other look better.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.420]   Sparring, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of that.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:46.140]   That's resistance, where you're trying to make
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.260]   the other person look as bad as possible.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:51.020]   And once you understand the different directions
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:52.740]   in which drilling and sparring go,
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.340]   that's when things start getting interesting.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:56.500]   You start getting fast progress.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.980]   - Yeah, just, you're absolutely right.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.180]   I think I was not very eloquent describing what I mean.
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:07.180]   I found myself not able to find in jiu-jitsu
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:08.900]   too many people that are willing
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.700]   to dedicate a huge amount of time
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.300]   to a particular technique.
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.940]   - I can agree with you on that, Lex.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.080]   Now, answer the interesting question, why?
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.980]   Why can't you get people to drill with you?
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:24.100]   - By the way, if I could just shout out,
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:25.660]   the people that did drill with me
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.660]   is usually blue belt women, because they're smaller.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:34.540]   They don't like training because they get their ass kicked
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.100]   because they're much smaller.
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:41.020]   So they're willing to invest a significant amount of effort
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:44.220]   into training.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:47.580]   - That's good, but their motivation for doing so
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.500]   is not good.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.180]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.380]   - And your motivation for drilling
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:52.660]   is 'cause you don't wanna get your ass kicked.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.460]   - No black belt ever.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.060]   I could never find a black belt
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.460]   that I could drill with like this.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.580]   - Now let's go back to that question, why?
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:03.460]   - I don't know if you mean this.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.940]   I am somebody who likes to say nice things about people.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:09.820]   - Let me answer for you.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.900]   Two reasons, because they find it boring.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.900]   And secondly, perhaps more importantly,
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:16.540]   they don't believe it works.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.340]   - Yeah, those are good answers.
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:20.100]   - And now let's go further
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.660]   and ask the truly interesting question,
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:23.940]   why do they believe that?
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:28.820]   - If I were to answer it, in the context
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:32.500]   of Russian wrestling, where drilling is much bigger part
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.620]   is I think culturally, that was knowledge
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:38.260]   that everybody tells each other in jiu-jitsu
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:43.260]   that drilling doesn't work.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:47.540]   - Because they're never taught how to drill.
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:49.100]   No one ever sits you down one day and says,
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.820]   okay, this is how you drill.
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:54.300]   And so the exercise feels futile.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.900]   They don't feel their skill level is going up.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:59.060]   They don't associate drilling with increased skill level.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.740]   They associate sparring with increased skill level,
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:03.780]   but not drilling, which is a tragedy
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:08.060]   because it is a fantastic way to introduce
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:11.380]   and expand the repertoire of a developing student.
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:13.780]   It's an essential part of every workout I teach.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.780]   I always say that game of jiu-jitsu begins with knowledge
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:20.460]   and builds up to skill.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:23.180]   Who wins is the one who has greatest skill
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.900]   and nine times out of 10.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:28.980]   So to me, it's a tragedy that what you're saying
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:31.220]   breaks my heart to hear that you couldn't get a black belt
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.420]   to drill with you, that's shameful.
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:38.300]   But I understand, I sympathize with those black belts too,
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:41.660]   because the way in which most people are told to drill
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:44.940]   does feel ineffective and it is damn boring.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.420]   They'd rather just spar.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:48.500]   They feel like they get more out of the workout.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.780]   And that's, if anything, an indictment
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:54.660]   upon most of the training programs around the nation.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.860]   - Would you say that drilling,
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.540]   if you were to build a black belt world champion,
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:05.780]   would drilling be what percent of their training
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:07.940]   in the entirety of their career would be drilling?
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:09.500]   - Good, great question.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.900]   Let's first put a proviso on it
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.180]   that I don't do the same thing for all athletes.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.220]   Everyone's got a different personality.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:19.580]   And like Nicky Rod, I can only hold his attention
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.900]   for two minutes at a time.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.900]   And Gary Tonin, five minutes.
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.460]   Gordon Ryan, five hours.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:31.700]   George St. Pierre, five hours.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.100]   Travis Stevens, five hours.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.420]   They are just laser focused.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:36.340]   So everyone's different.
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.500]   Let's put that down as our first proviso.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.220]   You probably knew those answers already.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.060]   - Yeah.
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.180]   That's hilarious.
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:49.260]   - But as a general rule,
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:51.920]   if I run a two and a half hour class,
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:56.180]   you can expect an hour and a half of it to be,
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:59.220]   I'm gonna use the word drilling,
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:02.380]   but I'm also gonna say that this is too complex of a story
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:03.940]   to give now with words.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:05.300]   I would need to demonstrate it.
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.620]   But the way in which we drill
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.580]   is not your standard method of drilling.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.980]   And then it's into sparring.
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:12.740]   But if you give me a choice
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:15.460]   between a bad drilling partner and sparring,
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:19.500]   I could make the same choice that most black belts make,
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.220]   which I would go with sparring.
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.820]   - 'Cause you can create drilling
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.940]   within the sparring environment.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.380]   - Like good drilling is a wonderful thing.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.780]   Bad drilling is just a worthless waste of time.
[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:36.060]   - Okay, before I have a million questions for you,
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.220]   but I have to ask,
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:41.020]   can you, we've described the fundamentals of jiu-jitsu.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:44.460]   Can we describe the principles, the fundamentals
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:46.760]   of one of the interesting systems you've developed,
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:49.220]   which is the leg lock system?
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.060]   - Yeah.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:50.940]   Anything in particular?
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:53.260]   Or just like a general understanding
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.860]   of what are some of the major principles of it?
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.100]   - Well, it's like me coming to Miyamoto Musashi
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.580]   and asking, can you describe the principles
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:03.940]   of sword fighting?
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.040]   - You're too generous.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:08.480]   Let's start off with some context.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:13.500]   When I began the sport of jiu-jitsu,
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:18.500]   I was taught a fairly classical approach to jiu-jitsu,
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.220]   which leg locks were a part of it,
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:25.020]   but not an emphasized part of it.
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:30.180]   The overall culture of the time, this is the mid 1990s,
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:34.140]   the overall culture of the time saw leg locks
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:36.340]   as largely ineffective.
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:44.820]   We were told that against good opposition,
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.000]   they just didn't work very well.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.160]   They were low percentage techniques.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.380]   We were also told that they were tactically unsound
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:54.420]   because if you ever attempted them
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:56.480]   and you lost control of the leg lock,
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.660]   your opponent would end up on top of you
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.260]   or in some kind of good position
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.400]   and you'd be in terrible trouble.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.660]   And we were also told that they were unsafe,
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:09.620]   that if they were applied in the gym,
[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.860]   there'd be far too many injuries
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.420]   and people would be badly hurt.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:16.940]   And that was the received wisdom of that time.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:21.180]   And so I didn't even work with them at all.
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:24.360]   And they would be shown occasionally in the gym
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.880]   and you'd learn them, you'd drill them.
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.300]   But in sparring, I showed no interest.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.680]   You probably know that change when I met
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.280]   the great American grappler, Dean Lister,
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:41.520]   who early in his career was using Achilles locks
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:43.000]   with considerable success.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.240]   I met him in the gym, wonderful fellow.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.160]   - Achilles locks is like a straight full lock.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.780]   - Yes, that's correct, yes.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:53.640]   And he went on to become a heel hooker
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.540]   and win 280 CCs later on in his career.
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:59.240]   But we never met again after that.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.240]   And that opened some doors of inquiry.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.240]   - Well, he asked this first principles question
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.400]   is why would you only use half the body in a game
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.760]   that involves the human body.
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.800]   - Perfect sense.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.820]   So that opened doors to inquiry.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:22.700]   And if you looked around the jiu-jitsu world at that time,
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:27.700]   the number of specialized leg lockers was very small.
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:32.960]   And most of them were from outside of conventional jiu-jitsu.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.900]   For example, you could look around and see people
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:39.480]   like Romina Sato had sharp leg locks
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.520]   for that time period in the 1990s.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.160]   So they were out there, they existed.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.320]   And you'd see people like Ken Shamrock
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:50.280]   would use heel hooks in competition
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:52.920]   and he had some good success with them.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:57.720]   When I began experimenting in the gym,
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.960]   fairly soon certain truths started to become evident.
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.800]   And the most important of these
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.160]   can be understood very quickly.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.660]   And they were relatively easy to discover.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.440]   The first was that most people,
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.440]   when they went to understand and study leg locking,
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.000]   and when I talk about leg locking,
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.640]   I'm gonna talk about one specific type,
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.800]   which is the most high percentage type.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.800]   This is leg locks, which are performed
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.000]   with entanglements of your opponent's legs with your legs.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.320]   There are other forms of leg lock,
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.120]   but these are relatively low percentage
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.820]   and don't figure heavily in competition.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.360]   So I'll ignore them.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:45.920]   Most people made no distinction
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.680]   between the mechanism of control
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.760]   versus the mechanism of breaking.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:56.760]   The heel hook is what ultimately breaks the ankle,
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.000]   but the mechanism of control is the entanglement
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.760]   of your legs to your opponent's legs.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.880]   The Japanese term, ashigurami,
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.920]   literally just means like leg entanglement.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:06.920]   It's a generic term.
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:08.880]   It could apply to any form of entanglement.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.360]   There are many options.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:16.120]   My idea was, let's focus on the entanglement first
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.360]   and worry about the breaking mechanism second.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.120]   This was analogous to the idea
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:25.080]   of position before submission,
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.560]   only you couldn't talk about it
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.680]   in terms of conventional positions
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.240]   because ashigurami doesn't really fit
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:33.320]   into the traditional hierarchies,
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.400]   positional hierarchies of jiu-jitsu.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.200]   So the conversation was switched from position
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.520]   to submission to control to submission.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.680]   Now, wrapping two of your legs
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.320]   around one of your opponent's legs
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.520]   gives you many different options.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.600]   You can do it with your feet on the outside,
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.280]   so-called 50/50 variations.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.720]   You can do it with your feet on the inside
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:58.720]   and form what we call inside foot position.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.960]   There's pros and cons to both.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:04.600]   There's also methods of harmonizing the two.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:05.920]   So you have one foot on the inside
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.400]   and one foot on the outside.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.160]   You can do it with a straight leg
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.160]   where you heel hook from the outside
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.000]   or you can bring the leg across your center line
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.560]   and heel hook from the inside.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.640]   You will start to notice
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.000]   as you work through these different variations
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.920]   that some present advantages over others.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:30.880]   All of them come at a price to some degree,
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:33.640]   regardless of which ashigurami option you use.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.120]   There will be some degree of foot exposure
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.800]   on my part to my opponent
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.160]   and some degree of back exposure
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:41.920]   on my part relative to my opponent.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.360]   So that's the downside of it.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.240]   Variations within those different ashigurami
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.420]   enable you to lessen danger in some respects
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.320]   and at the price of gaining dangers in others.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:59.920]   So you get this wide array of choices.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.440]   There's not this kind of simplistic hierarchy
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.480]   that you see in the basic positions of jiu-jitsu,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.400]   but there are hierarchies.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.800]   I do, for example, generally favor inside heel hooks
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.160]   over outside heel hooks.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:18.800]   If I feel my opponent is very good at exposing my back
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:20.240]   while I'm in ashigurami,
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:23.080]   I generally prefer 50/50 situations.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.880]   If I believe my opponent is very good at counter leg locks,
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.400]   I generally prefer my feet on the inside,
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:32.360]   working with variations of inside senkaku, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.160]   So there are broad heuristic rules
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.920]   that we can give to work in these situations.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:43.640]   Once you start to understand
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:48.000]   there's a variety of entanglements you can use,
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.920]   then you start getting to the really interesting ideas
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:55.920]   that as you perform one given attack, one given heel hook,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:01.320]   you can flow through different forms of ashigurami
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:04.760]   where you can create new dangers
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.240]   and avoid possible pitfalls
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.720]   in a very short timeframe
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.520]   as you switch from one ashigurami to another over time
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.800]   so that as your opponent's lines of resistance
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.760]   to an initial attack change,
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.920]   you can accommodate those
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.320]   by switching to another form of ashigurami
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.680]   so that your mechanism of control
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:28.080]   is always pointing in opposite directions of his escape.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:33.840]   And if you focus on this idea of control through the legs,
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:37.640]   you can completely change the nature of leg locking
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.640]   and take it away from what it was in the 1990s,
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.880]   an opportunistic method of attack
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:46.000]   based upon surprise, speed, and power
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.400]   into one based on control.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.720]   If you can do this,
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:55.680]   you can undermine many of the basic criticisms
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:56.920]   of leg locking,
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:01.320]   which were prevalent when I began the sport of jiu-jitsu.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:06.320]   For example, if I can completely control and immobilize you,
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.040]   I can perform the lock very, very safely.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.800]   If my only way of breaking your leg
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:14.840]   is to be faster and more powerful than you,
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:16.440]   nine times out of 10, when I apply it,
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.960]   I'm gonna hurt your leg as much by accident as anything.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:22.040]   But if I can completely immobilize you,
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.040]   and as every attempt you make to escape,
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.960]   I can follow you and immobilize you in new directions,
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:31.520]   then I can apply the lock with as much force
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.920]   or as little force as possible.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.640]   And so you'll see in our training room,
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:40.360]   despite over considerably more than two decades,
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.920]   sorry, a decade and a half now
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.340]   of heel hooking using these methods,
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:50.620]   the number of people severely injured by heel hooks is tiny.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:55.640]   I would say I've seen more people injured by far
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:58.640]   by Kimuras in the time I've been training
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:00.000]   that I have by heel hooks,
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.140]   despite them having a similar twisting dynamic to them.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:09.800]   If you build a culture where people focus on control
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.880]   rather than speed of execution,
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.040]   then the injury rate goes down appreciably.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.860]   The whole idea of positional loss,
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:18.560]   everyone was critical of leg locks.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.240]   Now, if you go for leg locks and they don't work,
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:21.840]   well, now you're in trouble.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.320]   The guy's gonna be on top of you.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:25.560]   They never make that criticism with arm bars.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.720]   Okay, you can be in a mounted position,
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:29.320]   go for an arm bar, end up on bottom,
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.760]   lose the arm bar and lose position,
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:33.120]   but I've never heard anyone criticize arm bars
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.280]   on that account.
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:38.400]   More importantly, I believed from early on
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.140]   that the best place to attack leg locks
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.000]   is not top position, it's bottom position.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.840]   You'll see that over 90% of my athletes
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:47.600]   attack leg locks from underneath people,
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.760]   not on top of people.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.080]   So there is no positional loss.
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.760]   You're already underneath them.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:54.460]   And so that criticism was null and void.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:54:01.200]   And by focusing on this idea of breaking down
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.960]   and distinguishing between the mechanism of control
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.960]   and the mechanism of breaking,
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.720]   that created something new and something interesting.
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.020]   There was also another advantage
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:17.020]   that I had in terms of creating influence with leg locking.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.600]   When you look at the great leg lockers of the past,
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.880]   they were basically iconoclasts.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.000]   They were people who came out of nowhere,
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.460]   who just had this remarkable success with leg locks.
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:35.200]   But they were just seen as unique individuals.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:39.000]   They had their game and they were good at it.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.960]   What was unique about the squad is you had
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.620]   not just one person, but a team of people
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.800]   who came out and did pretty much the same thing.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:50.080]   These people had very different body types
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.440]   and very different personalities.
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.120]   So it wasn't that one kind of body type was good at it.
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.680]   You had tall people like Gordon Ryan.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:00.480]   You had short people like Nicky Ryan.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.520]   You had someone in the middle like Gary Tonin.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.240]   You had fast people like Gary Tonin.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.840]   You had slow people like Gordon.
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:12.520]   There was every kind of body type involved.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.600]   And it was like, people could see this was different
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.760]   because it worked for an entire team.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.840]   As opposed to a unique individual who had unique attributes.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.120]   And that started to foster the belief that
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.520]   if it can work for a team, it can work for anyone.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:31.160]   Which means it can work for me.
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.400]   And I think that had a big effect.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.880]   That's why I owe a lot to those early students.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:44.680]   Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Eddie Cummings, and Nicky Ryan.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.800]   Those four kids came from nowhere.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.720]   Gary had some success in grappling,
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:55.520]   like low level success in grappling
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:00.240]   before becoming a full-time member of the squad.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.760]   But the others were just nobodies who no one had known.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:07.040]   And yet within a five-year timeframe,
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.240]   they were all going up against world championship
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.960]   competition and doing exceedingly well.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:16.600]   Which gives further credence to the idea
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.640]   of the five-year program.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.640]   And I think by operating as a team,
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.440]   those young men did an incredible job
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.440]   of convincing the grappling world
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.400]   that this wasn't just about, well, they're just different.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:35.800]   Or it works for their body type or them as individuals.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.400]   It was like, no, if a team can do it, anyone can do it.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:41.920]   And I think that's what really convinced people
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:44.080]   that this was something worth studying.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.920]   This is something that could be a big part of their lives.
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:49.560]   - But it also convinced you and convinced each other
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.480]   in those early days when you're developing the science.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:54.840]   Essentially what was missing is an entire science
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.760]   and system of leg locks.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.280]   Because it's not like you knew for sure
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.760]   that there's a lot here to be discovered
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.720]   in terms of control.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.800]   You perhaps had, just like you said, an initial intuition.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.480]   But you have to have enough,
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.400]   there's perseverance required to take,
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.600]   it's a Johnny Ive thing to take from the initial idea
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.800]   to an entire system.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:22.800]   Is there a sense you have about how complicated
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:28.000]   and how big this world of control in leg locks is?
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.880]   How complicated is it?
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.520]   You've achieved a lot of success.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.240]   You have a lot of powerful ideas in terms of inside,
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.560]   outside, what's high percentage, what's not,
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.840]   what's high reward, what's low risk,
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.280]   all those kinds of things.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.640]   And then you also mentioned kind of transitions,
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:49.400]   not transitions, but how you move with your opponent
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.560]   to resist their escape through control.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.960]   How much do you understand about this world?
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.760]   - This is a fascinating question.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:04.600]   As a general rule, the most powerful developments
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:09.720]   are always at the onset of a project.
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.200]   Let's give an example.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:18.600]   The jet engine was, I believe, first conceived
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:23.120]   in the late 1930s, just around the time of World War II.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:28.120]   It was developed with great pace because of World War II.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.960]   Obviously, military research was a huge thing back then.
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:36.960]   And first fielded, I believe, by the Germans in around 1943.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:44.080]   Jet aircraft didn't play a big role in World War II.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:45.320]   They were there at the end,
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.680]   and they did play a significant role,
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.240]   but in terms of numbers, they just weren't there.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:57.240]   So by around 1945, you had the onset of the jet age,
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:00.840]   and the jet engine began to replace the piston engine
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:01.720]   in most aircraft.
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:04.480]   It was the new way of doing things.
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:10.480]   If you look at the pace of development
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.480]   of jet engine aircraft technology from 1945 to 1960,
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:20.140]   it is unbelievable.
[01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:25.040]   There was a solid decade where they were gaining
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.440]   almost 100 miles an hour per year for a decade.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.620]   That's a form of growth that,
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:35.000]   I mean, in the world of engineering,
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.200]   that's the only time you see growth like that
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.100]   is in things like Bitcoin, and that's about it.
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:45.580]   Let's put things in perspective.
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:51.160]   In World War II, the standard US aircraft bomber
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:55.480]   was the B-17, which was a mid-sized bomber
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:57.760]   with a fairly limited load capacity,
[01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:02.760]   and I think top speed well below 300 miles an hour.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:08.200]   Just 10 years later, you had the B-52,
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.200]   which could fly across continents
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.400]   and deliver nuclear weapons and carry bomb loads
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:15.420]   of up to 70,000 pounds.
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:19.080]   In a decade, that happened.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:24.160]   If you took a B-17 pilot in 1943
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:27.400]   and put them inside a B-52 a decade later,
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:30.280]   he would literally think he was on a UFO,
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.800]   a ship from another planet.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:36.040]   That was the speed of development.
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:39.940]   Now, contrast that with the speed of modern development.
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:42.520]   If I took you in a time machine
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:48.120]   and I put you in a civil airliner in 1972,
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.720]   let's say a Boeing 737,
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:55.040]   it's not that different from what you fly in today.
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:55.880]   - That's right.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:59.120]   - It flies at the same speed, has the same range,
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.120]   flies at the same altitude.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.920]   It's not that different.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.120]   The amount of progress between 1973 and 2020
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.540]   isn't very impressive,
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:14.800]   but the amount of progress from 1945 to 1955,
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.520]   or even better, 1960, was staggering.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:23.160]   And so the initial progress tends to be meteoric,
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:25.680]   but after that, it tends to be incremental.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.160]   - That said- - You see that with leg-longs.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:30.480]   - There's a guy named Elon Musk
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.560]   who's been almost no development
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.560]   in terms of space rocket propulsion
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:43.680]   and rocket launches and going out into orbit
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.560]   or going out into deep space.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.780]   And one guy comes along,
[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:50.280]   one John Donahy type character,
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.040]   and says, "It doesn't make sense
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.840]   "why we don't use reusable rockets,
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.340]   "why we don't make them much cheaper,
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:58.360]   "why we don't launch every week
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:00.800]   "as opposed to every few years.
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:01.980]   "It doesn't make any sense
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:05.040]   "why we don't go to the moon again over and over and over.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:05.960]   "It doesn't make any sense
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:09.360]   "why we don't go to Mars and colonize Mars."
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:14.360]   It feels like it's not just a single jump to a B-52,
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:18.400]   it's a series of these kinds of jumps.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:21.720]   So the question is, is there another leap
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:24.080]   within the leg-locking system?
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:25.240]   - Time will tell.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.320]   I do believe that we're in a phase now
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:33.920]   where the really big jumps have already been made
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.520]   and we're in the incremental phase at this point.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:39.480]   What I do believe is that you will start
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:42.460]   to see new directions start to emerge,
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:44.040]   where you start to see the interface
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:46.560]   between leg-locking and wrestling, for example,
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.440]   the interface between leg-locking and back attacks.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:52.640]   And that will provide new avenues of direction
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.540]   which will create new spurts of growth.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:00.880]   But in terms of breaking people's legs,
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:03.140]   this is the simple act of breaking legs,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:04.880]   I believe we're in the incremental phase now
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.880]   rather than the meteoric phase.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:08.360]   - Let me ask you a ridiculous question.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.960]   How hard is it to actually break a leg?
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.160]   Is this something you think about?
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:15.920]   I remember, 'cause I'm a big fan of the straight foot lock.
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:19.720]   Not, again, we're talking about to the standing say, Nagi,
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:22.120]   maybe it's my Russian roots with Samba
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:22.960]   or something like that.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:26.760]   Maybe it's the Dean Lister, Achilles lock,
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:30.320]   but I love, maybe it's my body, something like that.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.000]   I just love the squeeze of it, the control
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.200]   and the power of a straight foot lock.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:42.780]   And I remember trying to,
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.480]   there's a few people in competition
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.920]   that didn't wanna tap.
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.060]   - Absolutely.
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:51.600]   - And I remember in particular, there was one person,
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.040]   it was again, a finals match, purple belt.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:56.720]   I remember it was a straight foot lock, it was perfect.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.440]   Everything just perfect.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:03.400]   And I remember going all in and there was a pop, pop, pop,
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.400]   and I couldn't do anything more.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:06.960]   It wasn't breaking.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.320]   It was just bending and bending and bending
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.140]   and there's damage to it of some kind,
[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:15.040]   but I wanted to like, you know,
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:16.240]   I wanted to see, first of all,
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:17.980]   it was very difficult psychologically
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:20.760]   because it's like, can I be violent here?
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.780]   That was in the whole nother thing.
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:25.200]   With adrenaline, you can't really think that fast,
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.940]   but I also thought like, where else is there to go?
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:29.580]   Like, is it the shin going to break?
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.060]   What is supposed to break?
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:31.900]   So I wondered that.
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.440]   - Yeah, in the case of the Achilles lock,
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.600]   it's going to be the anterior tibialis tendon.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:36.440]   - What's that?
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.140]   - It's the, it runs down, there's two of them.
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.020]   It'll be the minor one that runs on the outside
[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:42.780]   of the front of the ankle.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.300]   It's not going to be the Achilles tendon.
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:47.940]   A lot of people promulgate this absurdity.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.260]   The Achilles tendon can rupture, but not from pressure.
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:53.820]   - Is it the tendon or the bone that's going to break?
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.140]   - The bone won't break.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:59.260]   I have seen on one occasion a shin bone break
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.120]   from an Achilles lock,
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:04.520]   but there was an enormous size and strength disparity.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.560]   And there may have been other complicating factors too.
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:11.460]   But in the vast majority of cases,
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:15.020]   the Achilles lock doesn't really do tremendous damage.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:17.100]   It can do significant damage.
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.220]   You'll definitely feel it the next day,
[02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:20.820]   but it's of all the major locks,
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:23.400]   it's the one where it is most likely
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.140]   a psychologically strong opponent
[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.900]   will be able to absorb damage and go on to win a match.
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:30.460]   In answer to your first question,
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:32.340]   how difficult is it to break a leg?
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.460]   Not very difficult.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:37.700]   It will come down to what is the skill level
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:38.840]   of my opponent's resistance?
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:40.140]   If your opponent is not resisting
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.260]   and you have an inside heel hook,
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:44.100]   it is absurdly easy to break a man's leg.
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:45.260]   Not a challenge at all.
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:50.260]   You can be a 105 pound woman could easily snap
[02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:56.500]   the relevant knee ligaments in a 240 pound man's leg
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:58.580]   if he doesn't know how to defend himself.
[02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:02.060]   That's an easy thing, very easy to accomplish.
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:06.200]   So the basic answer is yes, it's very easy.
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:08.100]   If your opponent does know how to defend
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.500]   and they can position their foot,
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.980]   play tricks of lever and fulcrum,
[02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:14.620]   it becomes significantly more difficult.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:17.600]   It becomes still more difficult under match conditions
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:21.260]   where they're actively looking to position their body
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:23.660]   and work their way out of the lock,
[02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:26.040]   then it can become very difficult indeed.
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:32.180]   Always bear in mind that there have been some cases
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:34.940]   in our history as a team where people
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:38.020]   have literally just let their knees snap
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:41.880]   and continue fighting.
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:45.760]   Always remember that submission is a choice
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:47.700]   when it comes to the joint locks.
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:51.500]   And we've had some people who just made the choice
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:54.100]   that I'm willing to let my knee break
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.860]   so that I can continue in this match.
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:59.820]   That's a tough decision to make and I admire their bravery.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:02.160]   Is there something about that,
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:04.940]   just to speak to that, that you admire?
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:07.420]   Yes, it's mental toughness.
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:09.080]   Would I agree with it, would I advocate it?
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:12.820]   No, but that doesn't mean I can't admire aspects of it.
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:17.320]   Who is the greatest grappler ever?
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:23.220]   You were very astute in the way you asked that question.
[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:26.720]   You didn't say the greatest jujitsu player of all time,
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:28.160]   you specified grappler.
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.920]   What's the bigger category?
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:31.600]   Jujitsu is the bigger category.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:33.960]   Jujitsu has four faces.
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:37.740]   There is Gi competition, there is no Gi competition,
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:40.160]   there is mixed martial arts competition,
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.840]   and there is self-defense.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.680]   So jujitsu has four aspects.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:49.600]   Grappling typically refers only to the no Gi
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:53.080]   aspect of jujitsu, so it's one out of four possibilities.
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:56.520]   So who's the greatest jujitsu practitioner ever
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.960]   and then who is the greatest grappler ever?
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:02.920]   I believe that the greatest jujitsu player,
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:05.720]   certainly that I ever met and I believe of all time,
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:08.720]   I don't wanna sound arrogant on that
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:10.980]   because really you can only go with your own experiences
[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:13.320]   and there are some great athletes that other people
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:15.080]   mentioned that I just never met.
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:19.480]   But in my estimation, the greatest jujitsu player
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:20.620]   is Hodger Gracie.
[02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:26.520]   My reasoning for that is out of the four faces of jujitsu,
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:31.480]   he excelled in three.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:34.160]   And in two of them in particular,
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.880]   he was the best of his generation by a landslide.
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:42.000]   In Gi grappling, no Gi grappling,
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.760]   Hodger dominated his generation
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:50.400]   to a degree that is truly impressive.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:53.440]   - What do you attribute that dominance to, by the way?
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:56.040]   Is there something, if you were to analyze him--
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.920]   - Fascinating question, I'll come back to it.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:02.280]   In mixed martial arts, he was at his peak,
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:05.360]   I believe ranked in the top 10
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:09.480]   in the world of mixed martial arts.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.960]   He wasn't the best in mixed martial arts
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:14.360]   the way he was in grappling, but he was damn good.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.240]   And he beat some significant people.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:19.640]   So he showed tremendous versatility,
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:21.880]   Gi, no Gi, mixed martial arts.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:24.080]   He's not really known in the world of self-defense,
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.360]   but there's no real criteria by which
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.200]   you would become dominant in self-defense.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.080]   So that's kind of a, you can't really judge people by that.
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.160]   I'm believing, if Hodger got into a fight in the street,
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:36.240]   I'm sure he would do just fine.
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:38.320]   So I have no concerns about that.
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:42.680]   So I would say that if you look at jujitsu
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:46.320]   for what I believe it is, a sport with four faces,
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:50.000]   I believe you have to go with Hodger Gracie
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.800]   as the one who went out and empirically proved
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:58.320]   his ability to go across those elements
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:01.160]   and do extraordinarily well in all of them.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.080]   He even made the extraordinary step
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.880]   of coming out of retirement and beating the best
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.520]   of the generation that came after him.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.360]   - That's that, yeah?
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:11.840]   - Yes, that's a truly difficult feat.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:12.680]   - Yeah, that was incredible.
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:15.160]   - Yeah, and a sport which progresses very, very rapidly,
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.200]   that's a truly impressive accomplishment.
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:22.400]   If you ask the question, who is the greatest grappler
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:26.880]   that I've ever seen, I would say I've never seen
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.440]   anyone better than Gordon Ryan.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:32.680]   Now, people are gonna jump when I give these two names.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:33.960]   They're gonna say, well, Dan Hur,
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:35.520]   you're close friends with Hodger
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:38.620]   and you're close friends with Gordon, so you're biased.
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:42.200]   I can't answer them to that.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.600]   It's true, I'm good friends with both of them.
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:49.800]   I'm also a notoriously cold and unemotional person,
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.800]   and I'm saying this based upon things that I've observed.
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.720]   If I honestly believed that I'd seen other people
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:59.620]   who were better, I would have said it.
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:06.560]   Will that convince the people who criticize me of bias?
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.600]   Probably not, but those are the two names
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.440]   that I will mention.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:11.240]   - I think it's an uncontroversial statement
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:14.840]   to say that Gordon Ryan is one of the,
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.240]   the greatest grappler ever.
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:19.760]   - Yeah, Gordon's obviously a very polarizing figure,
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.480]   and people tend to react to Gordon on an emotional level
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:26.720]   rather than a statistical level,
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.080]   and that colors a lot of people's minds.
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.520]   But I also have the benefit that I've seen
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:33.660]   both of these guys extensively in the gym,
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:36.400]   and that adds a whole new perspective.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:40.080]   If you think those guys are dominant on the stage,
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:41.380]   wait 'til you see them in the gym.
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:43.480]   It's even a different level of domination,
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:47.520]   above and beyond what they did in competition.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.840]   - Have they trained against each other in the gym?
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.080]   - No, they never trained together.
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.640]   They've been in the same gym, I think, only on one occasion.
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:55.440]   When Hodger was stopped by New York,
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.840]   he came by to say hello, and Gordon was here at the time.
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.520]   They shake hands, they know each other,
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:04.900]   and they're both wonderful people in their own way.
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:09.400]   - So I'd like to talk to you about Gordon, Hodger,
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.180]   and George, GSB.
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:14.920]   Let's first talk about what do you think,
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:17.240]   'cause it's very different from my perspective,
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:21.400]   maybe you can correct me, but very different artists.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.240]   - Yes.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:24.520]   - Masters of their pursuits.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.720]   So what makes Hodger so good?
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:32.160]   - Hodger was probably the living embodiment
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:36.780]   of someone who played a classical jujitsu game,
[02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:40.880]   based around the fundamental four steps of jujitsu.
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.560]   If you took someone who had taken introduction lessons
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:51.240]   in jujitsu for three months,
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:56.240]   they would recognize the outlines of Hodger's game
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:59.520]   with many of the techniques they learned
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.980]   in those first three months.
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:06.720]   Hodger was the best example of the dichotomy
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.000]   between the fundamentals of jujitsu,
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.400]   but also a kind of hidden sophistication
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.620]   underneath those fundamentals.
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:20.700]   People always say, "Oh, Hodger's game was so basic."
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:24.480]   No, the outlines of Hodger's game were basic,
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.200]   but the degree of sophistication
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:28.700]   and the application was extraordinary.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:35.280]   And his ability to refine existing technology
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.680]   was truly impressive.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.560]   I never saw anyone in his generation
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.160]   that even came close to his ability,
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.360]   both in competition and in the gym.
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:50.720]   - So for people who don't know,
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:53.360]   Hodger Gracie basically used, just like you said,
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:57.700]   very simple techniques on the surface,
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:00.340]   from the outsider's perspective,
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:04.400]   that most people learn when they start jujitsu,
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:06.240]   like passing guard in a very simple way,
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:09.840]   taking mount and choking from mount.
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:12.600]   Also, when he's on his back,
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.880]   this closed guard and all the basic submissions
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:17.920]   from closed guard, armbar, and triangle.
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:20.680]   And just, that's it.
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:25.680]   And being able to dominate, shut down, and submit.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.420]   So control and submit the best people in the world
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:32.400]   for many, many years, just like you said,
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.400]   including coming out of retirement and beating the best,
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.560]   perhaps by far the best of the next generation.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.040]   So that just kind of lays out the story.
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:48.040]   Is there some lessons about his systems
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.440]   that you learn in developing your own systems?
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:53.480]   - Excellent question.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:58.400]   The thing which always impressed me the most about Hodger
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:03.400]   was his relentless pursuit of position to submission.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:09.960]   Everything was done with the belief
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.120]   that no victory was worthwhile
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.920]   if it didn't involve submitting his opponent.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:20.020]   That's a mindset that I try very, very hard
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:22.040]   to imbue in my students.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.160]   The easiest path to victory in jujitsu
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:27.360]   is the one which takes the least risk.
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:30.480]   So for example, you will see many modern athletes
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.020]   focus on scoring the first point or the first advantage,
[02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:36.720]   and then doing the minimum amount of work
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:40.400]   to eke out a victory once they've done that.
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:42.280]   They get a small tactical advantage,
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.800]   they realize they're ahead, take no more risks,
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:48.200]   and just do the minimum amount of work to get the victory.
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:52.240]   Hodger's mindset was always to take
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:54.960]   the riskier gambit of submission,
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:56.760]   which entails a lot more work,
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.600]   and in many cases, a lot more skill.
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:03.000]   What I always liked about Hodger
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.920]   is he never tried to play tactics.
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:08.640]   It was always just go out there
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.280]   and try to win by submission.
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:14.160]   And that, more than anything,
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:19.160]   that mindset of looking for the most perfect victory
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:23.080]   rather than the victory that takes the least skill
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.840]   and the least effort is probably the thing
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:28.760]   I took from his career the most
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:30.760]   and tried to work on in my students.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:35.440]   - I always wonder what are the little details
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:38.120]   he's doing under there when he's in mount,
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.920]   the little adjustments, you know?
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:43.200]   But perhaps that's like almost indescribable,
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:45.100]   the details of that control.
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:51.500]   What makes Gordon Ryan the greatest grappler
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:53.940]   of all time so good?
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:56.640]   - With Gordon, he's also very strong on fundamentals,
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:58.120]   all of my students are,
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:02.880]   but he's also obviously a member of a new generation
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:06.480]   of nogi grapplers that also bring in technologies
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:10.880]   that weren't really emphasized in previous generations,
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:15.880]   specifically the prolific use of lower body attacks,
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:18.320]   especially from bottom position.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:22.300]   This means that he can play a game
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:24.960]   between upper body and lower body,
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:28.080]   which was not really a part of Hodge's game.
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:32.420]   Nonetheless, you will also see significant similarities.
[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:35.920]   He's got a very strong and crushing passing game to mount
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:39.240]   and a very strong and crushing passing game to the back.
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:46.640]   You will see that the major differences
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:49.120]   between the two are from bottom position.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:51.080]   Hodge's bottom game is essentially based
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.340]   around his close guard,
[02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:55.400]   Gordon Ryan's game is based around his butterfly guard.
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:57.400]   So one is based on outside control
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:00.000]   and one is based on inside control.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.140]   One focuses almost entirely on the classical notion
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:05.800]   of getting past the legs to the upper body,
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:08.340]   and the other one works between the two as alternatives
[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:10.600]   and sees them as competing alternatives.
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:12.500]   With a strong you become at one,
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:14.200]   the more your opponent has to overreact
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:16.140]   and become vulnerable to the second.
[02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:19.200]   So they have strong similarities in top position,
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:20.760]   but a very different in bottom.
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:25.480]   - He has, from an outsider's perspective,
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.480]   a calm to him in the heat of battle
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:35.320]   that's like, that's inspiring and confusing.
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:37.500]   Is there something you could speak
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:40.700]   to the psychological aspect of Gordon Ryan?
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:41.540]   - Yes.
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:47.580]   People will talk all day about sports psychology
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:52.180]   and they will often have heated arguments
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:54.980]   as to what's the right psychological state to be in
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:56.660]   when you go out to compete.
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:18:59.380]   I've never seen any one school of thought
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:03.160]   which gave noticeably better sports performance than another.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:08.180]   I've never seen any psychological mindset
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:11.740]   prove to be reliably more efficient
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:13.900]   or effective than another.
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:17.300]   I've seen fighters that were scared out of their minds
[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:19.180]   when they went out every time to fight
[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:20.980]   and yet they were very successful.
[02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:23.980]   I've seen fighters go out who were relaxed and calm
[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:25.740]   and they too can be successful.
[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:27.340]   I've seen both mindsets win,
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:29.180]   I've seen both mindsets lose.
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:31.040]   I've seen every extreme between them.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:35.260]   What I generally recommend with regards
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:37.580]   your mind and preparation going in,
[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:39.020]   find what works for you.
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:40.240]   Everyone's different.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:42.500]   Don't try to give a one size fits all
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:46.040]   in something as vague and confusing as the human mind.
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:51.400]   Having said that, my preference,
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:54.240]   I don't force it on people because everyone's different,
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:57.600]   but my preference is to try and advocate
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:01.040]   for a mindset of unexceptionalism.
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:04.320]   Most people see competition as something exceptional.
[02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:06.400]   It's not your everyday grappling session.
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:09.960]   You train 300 times for every time you compete.
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:11.240]   And so they see competition
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:14.320]   as something exceptional, different, scarier,
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:15.160]   or nerve wracking.
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.400]   There's a crowd watching these cameras.
[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:18.760]   My reputation is on the line.
[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:21.040]   I'm gonna be observed and judged.
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:23.920]   And so they see it as this exceptional event.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:26.000]   My general preference is to see it
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.640]   as an unexceptional event, to see everything else,
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:34.160]   the noise, the cameras, the crowd, as illusions.
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.060]   The only reality is a stage,
[02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:37.680]   an opponent on the other side of it,
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.880]   and a referee adjudicating you.
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:43.760]   And to make it as unexceptional as possible.
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:48.600]   Gordon does an extraordinarily good job of doing that.
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:52.440]   Gordon looks more tense in most of his training sessions
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:54.120]   than he does in his competitions
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:55.600]   because he knows his training partners
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.600]   are typically better than the people
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:20:59.760]   he's actually going out to compete against.
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:03.480]   And you see it in his demeanor.
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:06.160]   It's one of just complete calm.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:08.800]   It also goes back to what we talked about earlier
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:11.240]   about the power of escapes.
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:13.880]   Gordon Ryan is almost impossible to control
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:16.320]   for extended periods of time
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:19.520]   in most of the inferior positions in the sport
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:21.320]   and most of the submissions.
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:23.440]   So he goes out in the full knowledge
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:27.400]   that the worst case scenario isn't that bad for him.
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:29.960]   And so nothing could really go that badly wrong.
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:32.360]   He can always recover from any given mistake
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:33.920]   and go on to victory.
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:35.480]   When you believe those things,
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.720]   you're gonna have a calm demeanor.
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:41.400]   - Then if you look at somebody who is quite a bit different
[02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:43.000]   than that, Georges St. Pierre,
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.760]   who at least in the way he describes it,
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:50.360]   he's basically exceptionally anxious
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:53.560]   and terrified approaching a fight.
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:56.080]   And he loves training.
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:56.960]   - And hates fighting.
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:58.520]   - And hates fighting.
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:02.400]   So, and just like you said, he made it work for him.
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:06.080]   But he's somebody, he speaks very highly of you.
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:08.880]   He's worked with you quite a bit in training.
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:13.600]   And you've studied him, you've worked with him,
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:15.560]   you've coached him.
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:17.200]   - Interestingly, I've actually coached George
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:20.160]   for twice the length of any of the squad members.
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:23.480]   So my knowledge of him is far greater than it is
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:26.240]   for the contemporary squad.
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.120]   - So can you speak to what makes Georges St. Pierre,
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:31.920]   who I think, even though I'm Russian
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:35.440]   and a little bit partial towards Fedor and the Russians,
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:39.280]   but I think he is in the four categories you mentioned,
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:43.080]   the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:44.960]   What makes him so good?
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:48.280]   His approach, his techniques, his mind.
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:50.240]   - His approach is certainly part of it.
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:53.760]   George started mixed martial arts at a time when
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:59.120]   the sport was in a pretty wild phase.
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:04.760]   It was illegal to show on most American TV networks.
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:08.520]   And there was talk about it being banned as a sport.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:12.360]   In his native Canada, it was banned.
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:15.680]   You could only fight on Indian reservations in Canada.
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:17.600]   I believe his first fight may have been
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:18.880]   on an Indian reservation.
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:25.680]   So the sport at that stage was very much in its infancy.
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:30.120]   And it's probably fair to say that most of the athletes
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:32.880]   involved in the sport came from
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:38.440]   a training program that would probably be described
[02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:43.520]   as unprofessional in the contemporary scene.
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:48.200]   George is one of a handful of people
[02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:49.960]   who started approaching the sport
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:51.600]   in a truly professional fashion.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.720]   It was like, okay, here's what great athletes
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:54.880]   in other sports do.
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:57.000]   I'm gonna try to emulate that.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.000]   And his ability to invest in other sports
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:04.080]   and to invest in himself.
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.160]   In my own experience, for example,
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.120]   George, when I first met him, was a garbage man.
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:15.120]   And he would jump on a bus from Montreal to New York.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:16.880]   Now that's a long bus ride.
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.720]   He would come down on a Friday afternoon
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:20.760]   when he finished work as a garbage man,
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:22.920]   stay for the weekend, and then late on Sunday night,
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.000]   he would jump on a bus all the way back to Montreal
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.240]   and work as a garbage man.
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:30.040]   That's an extraordinary commitment
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.480]   for a young man to make.
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:38.680]   And George was a blue belt at the time.
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:41.040]   And so he would come down and, you know,
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:42.480]   we had a very talented room.
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:46.040]   So he didn't do well in the room when he first came in.
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:47.600]   He was inexperienced in jujitsu.
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:51.640]   And the people he went against
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:53.440]   were considerably better than him at jujitsu.
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:58.440]   So imagine investing 25% of your weekly income,
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:03.200]   maybe even more, New York's an expensive town, 50%,
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.300]   to come down and just get your ass kicked.
[02:25:05.300 --> 02:25:06.680]   (Lex laughs)
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:07.680]   Month by month.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:09.760]   - Yeah, that says a lot about who he is.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:11.300]   - It tells you a lot.
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:13.440]   First of all, let's talk about the whole idea
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:14.960]   of delayed gratification here.
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:17.400]   I mean, that's a guy who's saying,
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.360]   like, this is highly unpleasant,
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.160]   but I have a vision of myself in the future,
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:24.900]   and I have to go through this extreme case
[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:27.600]   of delayed gratification to get to that distant goal,
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:29.360]   which may never happen.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:33.200]   And that's a level of commitment and self-belief,
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.720]   which is just extraordinary.
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:37.240]   I always laugh when people say, you know,
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:39.920]   oh, George was afraid, so he was mentally weak.
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:44.920]   Like, no, that's a very, very shallow understanding
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.620]   of mental strength and weakness.
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:55.020]   George felt anxiety, but let's understand from the start,
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:57.760]   there's different kinds of mental strength.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.560]   And the most important kind isn't whether you feel fear
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.880]   or don't feel fear before you step in to fight.
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:06.040]   The most important form of mental strength
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:09.720]   is discipline and training.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:11.640]   That's where most people break.
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:15.260]   I know dozens of people who are fearless to fight,
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:16.940]   but you couldn't get them to come into the gym
[02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:19.920]   for three months in a row and work on skills.
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:22.720]   So they're mentally strong one way, they don't feel fear,
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:24.400]   but they're mentally weak in another,
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.320]   which is to instill the discipline
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:29.120]   which keeps you on a road to progress over time.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.440]   That's much tougher than not feeling fear
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:33.200]   before you go out to fight.
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:36.400]   Understand also that when George talks about fear,
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.000]   he's not afraid of his opponent.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.600]   He's afraid of failure.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:44.660]   He's got high standards.
[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:49.260]   Someone who's got high standards can change the world.
[02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:52.880]   His standards were very, very high.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:54.240]   That's what he was afraid of.
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:56.680]   He wasn't afraid of his opponent.
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:59.000]   And yet, it's always been a misinterpretation.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.240]   He wasn't mentally weak, he was mentally strong as an ox.
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:05.880]   Okay, to stay in his training regimen
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:08.320]   year after year after year,
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:10.720]   and do so while he became one of the first stars
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:13.800]   in mixed martial arts to actually make money.
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:16.320]   And it gets tough to stay in the training gym
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:18.080]   with people who are young and hungry
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.720]   and wanna punch you in the face.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.680]   You're coming out of a luxury room,
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:24.560]   living in finery towards the end of his career,
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:26.080]   and still training as hard as ever.
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.440]   That's an impressive thing.
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:31.000]   - And always he valued perfection, and you're right.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.480]   That was, the fear was not achieving the perfection.
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:39.780]   Is there something you've observed
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:42.160]   about the way he approaches training
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.280]   that stands out to you?
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:48.040]   Or is it simply the dedication?
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:50.000]   - No, it's never just about dedication.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.680]   There's lots of dedicated people in the world,
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:53.380]   but most of them are unsuccessful.
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:28:00.440]   If you wanna be the best in the world at anything,
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:04.760]   you have to do out of the many skills
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:07.260]   of whatever industry you're in,
[02:28:07.260 --> 02:28:13.080]   you have to take at least one of those skills
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.980]   and be the best in the world at it.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:20.520]   There's many skills in mixed martial arts,
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:24.920]   but George identified one skill,
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:28.080]   which is the skill of striking to take down.
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:29.600]   So he calls it shoot boxing.
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:37.680]   Shoot boxing was barely even a category of skill
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.560]   when George began.
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:40.960]   It was just the idea that wrestlers grab people
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:43.240]   and took them down the same way they did in wrestling,
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:47.720]   and you threw some punches before you did it.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:53.440]   Okay, George largely pioneered the science
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:29:00.880]   of creating an interface between striking and takedowns.
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:07.320]   He did it at a time where no one else before him
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:10.500]   had made it into a system or a science.
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.540]   He did it largely on his own,
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:19.520]   and I've always said,
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:21.920]   George is the only athlete that I ever coached
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:24.060]   who taught me more than I taught him.
[02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:30.520]   And almost single-handedly,
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:35.840]   he created this strong sense of shoot boxing as a science,
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:41.200]   which enabled him throughout his career
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:44.480]   to determine where the fight would take place.
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:47.440]   Would it be standing or would it be on the ground?
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.340]   And that, more than anything else,
[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:52.060]   was the defining characteristic of his success.
[02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:58.240]   I will always be immensely impressed
[02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:00.120]   by his accomplishment in that regard.
[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:01.140]   He was an innovator.
[02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:03.360]   He did things differently.
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:05.120]   This is such an important point.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:08.240]   You can't go out there in combat sports
[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:11.400]   and do the same things that everybody else is doing
[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:13.500]   and expect to get different results.
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:16.480]   Life doesn't work that way.
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:18.120]   If you want to be dominant,
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.680]   you gotta find one important part of the sport
[02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:22.700]   and preferably more than one
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:24.560]   and be the best in the world at it.
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:26.680]   You can't be weak at anything,
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:28.640]   but you can't be strong at everything either.
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:29.800]   Life's not long enough for us
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:32.600]   to develop a truly complete skillset.
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:34.120]   So you gotta be good at everything
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:36.600]   and you gotta be the best at at least one thing.
[02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:39.600]   And George was the best at two in his era.
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:43.360]   He was the best at striking to takedowns
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:45.160]   and he was the best at integrating
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:46.960]   striking and grappling on the floor.
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:52.400]   - Let me ask you a completely ridiculous question,
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:54.900]   but it's a fascinating one for me
[02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:57.460]   from an engineering and a scientific perspective.
[02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:02.640]   When I look at a sport, really any problem,
[02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:06.640]   one way to ask how difficult is this problem
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:11.000]   is to see how can I build a machine
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.320]   that competes with a human being at that problem?
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:16.360]   You can look at chess, you can look at soccer,
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:21.360]   RoboCup, and then you can look at grappling.
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:25.600]   There's something about when you start to think,
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:28.200]   how would I build an AI system,
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:31.840]   a robot that defeats somebody like a Gordon Ryan,
[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:34.340]   where it forces you to really think
[02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:39.340]   about formalizing this art as an engineering discipline.
[02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:42.640]   In the same way you do,
[02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:46.520]   but you still have some art injected in there.
[02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:48.120]   There is no space for art
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:49.600]   when you actually have to build the system.
[02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:50.920]   - That's not a ridiculous question.
[02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:52.800]   That's a damn interesting question.
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:55.760]   - Let's put aside, like I mentioned
[02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:58.080]   with the Boston Dynamics robot,
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.320]   what people don't realize is the amount of power
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.600]   they can deliver is huge.
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:04.960]   So let's take that weapon aside.
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:07.520]   Just the amount of force you're able to deliver.
[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:10.100]   - Yeah, I'm glad you're specifying that.
[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:13.480]   So essentially your question is, okay,
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:17.800]   can a talented group of engineers create a robot
[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:19.000]   which could defeat Gordon Ryan?
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.780]   On the face of it, as you just pointed out,
[02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:24.640]   that's the easiest project in the world.
[02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:27.120]   Just create a robot that carries a nine millimeter automatic
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:28.480]   and shoot him five times in the chest.
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:30.560]   Okay, that's it, Gordon Ryan's done.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:32.360]   - That's not the interesting question.
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:33.800]   The interesting question,
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.440]   and if I understand you correctly,
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:40.440]   is if we had the ability to create a robot
[02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:45.120]   whose physical powers were identical to Gordon Ryan,
[02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:47.280]   not inferior and not superior,
[02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:51.480]   what would it take to create a mind inside that robot
[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:53.600]   that would beat Gordon Ryan in the majority of matches?
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:56.800]   - Yeah, and there's two ways to build AI systems.
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:33:00.440]   This is true for Thomas driving, for example.
[02:33:00.440 --> 02:33:03.340]   Which has been quite contested recently.
[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:06.160]   So one is you basically, one way to describe it
[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:09.280]   is you have a giant set of rules.
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.240]   It's like this tree of rules
[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:13.040]   where you apply a different condition.
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:15.360]   When there's a pattern you see, you apply a rule.
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:17.240]   And they're hard-coded in.
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:20.520]   You basically get like a John Donahue type of character
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:25.520]   who tries to encode, hard-code into the system
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:29.720]   all the moves you should do in every single case.
[02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:32.480]   Of course, you can't actually do that fully.
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:34.760]   So you're going to be taking shortcuts,
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:36.880]   what are called heuristics,
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:41.040]   just a basic kind of generalizations,
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:45.040]   and apply your own expertise as an expert of,
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:47.040]   in this case, grappling,
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:49.080]   to see how that can be encoded as a rule.
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:50.840]   Now, the other approach,
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:53.240]   Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach,
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:55.440]   which is called machine learning,
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:00.440]   which is create a basic framework
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:04.200]   of the kind of things you should be observing
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:09.680]   and what are the measures, metrics of success,
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.920]   and then just observe and see which things lead to success,
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:16.080]   more success and which lead to less success.
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.300]   And there's a delta.
[02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:21.360]   When you see a thing, first of all,
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:23.760]   the way machine learning works is you predict,
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:26.800]   you see a position or you see a situation,
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:28.940]   and then you predict how good that is,
[02:34:28.940 --> 02:34:31.280]   and then you watch how it actually turns out,
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:34.800]   and if it's worse or better, you adjust your expectation.
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.200]   - Yes, that's correct. - And through that process,
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:39.020]   you can learn quite a lot.
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:45.000]   The challenges, and this might be a very true challenge
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000]   in grappling, is in driving, you can't crash.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.600]   So there's a physical world.
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:57.040]   In chess, for example,
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:00.960]   where this approach has been exceptionally successful,
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:02.640]   you can work in simulation.
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:06.400]   So you can have AI system that, for example,
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.280]   as in the case with AlphaZero by DeepMind,
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:14.040]   Google's DeepMind, it can play itself in simulation
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:15.720]   millions of times, billions of times.
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:16.960]   - Correct, yeah.
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:19.400]   - It's difficult to know if it's possible
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.160]   to do that in simulation for anything
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:28.160]   that involves human movement, like grappling.
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.840]   So that's, my sense is, if we first look
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:36.160]   at the hard encoding, if you were to try
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:39.480]   to describe Gordon Ryan to a machine,
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.400]   how many rules are in there, do you think?
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:44.000]   - Yeah, first off, let me tell you,
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.600]   that's one of the most fascinating questions
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:49.200]   I've ever been asked, and I'm tremendously happy
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:50.120]   to answer this.
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:54.920]   How about what we do is, this is a massive question
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:56.840]   you've asked, there's a huge amount of ways
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:59.440]   this could get very interesting and very confusing.
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:03.100]   Let's set some ground rules for the discussion.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:09.800]   Lex alluded to the idea of man versus machine in chess.
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:12.800]   Okay, and I think that's a really good place
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:14.980]   for us to start the discussion.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:20.160]   I'm gonna just tell people a little bit
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.160]   the history of man versus chess,
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:25.440]   to give you guys some background on this.
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:29.600]   In 1968, there was a party in which a highly ranked,
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:31.920]   not a world champion, but a highly ranked chess player,
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:36.920]   his name was Levy, and he met a computer engineer
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:44.400]   at a party, and they had a lighthearted bet
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:49.960]   that in a 10 year time frame, a human chess player
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.960]   would be defeated by a computer.
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:56.480]   Now, you gotta remember, in 1968, computing power
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:57.640]   was very, very low.
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:00.000]   The computers that got America to the moon
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.880]   were actually pretty damn primitive.
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:04.980]   Your iPhone would kick all of their asses.
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:09.400]   So computational power was very, very low in those days.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:12.800]   So, interestingly, the chess player fully believed
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:15.360]   that no computer could beat him in the 10 year time frame,
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:18.560]   and the computer engineer was very optimistic
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:21.560]   that he was wrong, and in fact, 10 years,
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:24.280]   the computer would win.
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:26.240]   10 years later, they had a competition,
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:29.660]   and the human won, decisively, in fact.
[02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:33.800]   So computational power simply hadn't risen
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:35.400]   to that level yet.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:38.760]   Through the 1980s, computational power increased,
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:43.760]   but not sufficient to get to championship level.
[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:45.820]   There were computer programs in the 1980s
[02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:49.740]   which were competitive with good, solid chess players,
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:51.060]   but not world beaters.
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:56.800]   Understand, right from the start,
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.540]   that there's a fundamental problem here.
[02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:05.380]   The number of options that the two players
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:10.380]   in a chess board can run through is astronomically high.
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:14.380]   There are 64 squares on a chess board.
[02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:18.860]   The number of possible options that could work
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:22.320]   or could play out on a chess board,
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:25.980]   and this is a truly shocking thing for you to think about,
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:29.340]   the number of possible options is higher
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:34.340]   than the number of atoms in the known universe.
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:38.460]   Think about that for a second in terms of complexity, okay?
[02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:43.060]   The number of atoms on this table is massive, okay?
[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:47.200]   That is an unbelievably large number.
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:50.340]   And we're talking about a situation where,
[02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:52.780]   if a computer had to go through all the options
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:53.880]   at the onset of a match,
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:57.240]   they would have to run numbers greater
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:00.420]   than the number of atoms in the known universe.
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:05.420]   The number of galaxies in our universe is vast, okay?
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:06.860]   It's measured in the billions.
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:09.660]   Like the number of atoms, that's just a number
[02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:12.100]   so mind-blowing it's impossible, okay?
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:17.100]   So no computer is ever going to be able to work
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:19.740]   with those kinds of numbers, okay?
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:21.660]   I don't even know if future generations
[02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:24.420]   of quantum computers could work with those kinds of numbers.
[02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:26.380]   So that's the fundamental problem, okay?
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:28.740]   The number of options in a chess match
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:31.560]   is just so astronomically large
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:34.700]   that no computer could ever figure out
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:37.060]   all the available options and make decisions
[02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:37.980]   in a given timeframe.
[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:40.100]   So that's the fundamental problem.
[02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:43.540]   So as Lex correctly pointed out,
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:46.580]   the way you get around this is by the use of heuristics.
[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:48.740]   These are rules of thumb,
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:51.720]   which give general guidelines to action.
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:52.980]   So for example, in jiu-jitsu,
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:55.620]   I could give you a general rule of thumb.
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:39:57.940]   Don't turn your back on your opponent, okay?
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:39:59.260]   That's a solid piece of advice.
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:01.300]   There are obviously some exceptions to that rule,
[02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:04.020]   but it's a good solid piece of advice to give a beginner.
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:06.540]   The moment you give that heuristic rule,
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:09.260]   you rule out a lot of options, okay?
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:11.340]   You've already told someone, don't turn your back,
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:12.520]   don't turn your back on someone.
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:14.060]   So a lot of possibilities
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:16.260]   have just been turned away right there.
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:18.620]   So you've cut the number of options in half right there
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:21.180]   just by giving one heuristic rule, okay?
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:26.680]   If you were decent at chess, not great, but decent,
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:30.540]   and you knew enough to give, say, 10 heuristic rules,
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:33.860]   you could chop that initially vast number of options
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:36.380]   down by a vast amount.
[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:38.220]   And now you're starting to get to a point
[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:41.860]   where if a computer had sufficient computational power,
[02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:44.980]   it could start getting through the number of options
[02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:46.640]   in that acceptable timeframe.
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:50.440]   So that's the general pattern of the development.
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.220]   Now, things started getting very interesting
[02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:56.540]   in the mid-1990s with IBM's computer Deep Blue.
[02:40:56.540 --> 02:41:01.380]   There was a great chess champion of the late 1980s
[02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:05.340]   and early through the 1990s called Garry Kasparov,
[02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:08.900]   who had been more or less undefeated for a decade.
[02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:12.200]   In 1996, he took on IBM's computer Deep Blue.
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:16.380]   - Just to correct the record, he was undefeated.
[02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:20.460]   I apologize, Russian, gotta make sure--
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:22.020]   - They get very nationalistic about their chess,
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:23.420]   be careful of these guys.
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:26.980]   Deep Blue lost the first confrontation, I believe, in 1996.
[02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:28.700]   It was competitive, but it lost.
[02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:33.020]   Then in 1997, Deep Blue won.
[02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:35.660]   And it wasn't a complete walkover.
[02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:38.060]   Kasparov, I believe, won one of the matches.
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:42.060]   But they did, Deep Blue unequivocally
[02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:43.500]   won the confrontation.
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:45.660]   And it was seen as like this watershed moment
[02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:49.900]   where a computer beat the best human chess player
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:52.340]   on the planet, and that was it.
[02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:54.580]   There's no coming back from that.
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:57.540]   - I think it would be remembered as one of the biggest moments
[02:41:57.540 --> 02:42:00.860]   in computing history, as really when the first time
[02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:02.980]   a machine beat a human at a thing that humans
[02:42:02.980 --> 02:42:06.540]   really care about in the domain of intellectual pursuits.
[02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:10.340]   - Yeah, it was a powerful, powerful moment.
[02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:13.580]   Now, not only was that a powerful moment,
[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:15.700]   but things started getting truly interesting
[02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:17.140]   from that moment forward.
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:19.020]   'Cause then you started having different areas
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:19.980]   of development.
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:30.780]   The general way in which the progress is made
[02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:32.980]   from those early starts in 1968,
[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:36.900]   all the way through to Deep Blue's victory
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:39.420]   was of the use of heuristic rules
[02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:42.660]   that brought down the number of potential options
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:44.300]   to a manageable level.
[02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:46.380]   As computer power increased,
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:48.340]   then it could make faster and faster
[02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:50.220]   and wiser and wiser decisions,
[02:42:50.220 --> 02:42:52.740]   and make them at a rate which no human,
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:54.500]   even the best human could keep up with.
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:58.560]   So that was the general way in which the debate went.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:03.500]   But things got more interesting after this,
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:08.460]   with the advent of computers that, as you pointed out,
[02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:10.700]   make use of so-called machine learning.
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:17.940]   There were, a company put out a program, AlphaZero,
[02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:25.300]   which can look at the basic rule structures of chess,
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:29.140]   and then ultimately play itself in trial games,
[02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:30.780]   and make trial and error assessment
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:32.780]   of what are good and bad strategies.
[02:43:32.780 --> 02:43:35.100]   So that with no human intervention,
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:38.640]   a computer could start doing remarkable things.
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:45.780]   Not only did this company create AlphaZero,
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:47.780]   and there were some other ones too,
[02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:49.360]   that they fought not only in chess,
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:53.580]   but in the much more complex Asian game of Go,
[02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:58.220]   which has far more potential options than chess does,
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:00.020]   by a very significant margin.
[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:04.380]   These machine learning programs,
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:07.780]   not only easily defeat any human in chess,
[02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:09.560]   but in Go as well.
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:12.380]   And what's truly remarkable
[02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:14.860]   is they weren't just beating them.
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:18.300]   When AlphaZero took on a rival chess program,
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:21.180]   which by itself is already superior to any human,
[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:27.460]   it only required four hours,
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:30.220]   starting from learning the rules of chess,
[02:44:30.220 --> 02:44:32.140]   to figuring out how to beat
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:35.180]   the second most powerful chess program in the world.
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:37.420]   That's insane.
[02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:39.820]   That's literally like taking a human,
[02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:41.460]   telling them the rules of chess,
[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:44.580]   they play some games with themselves for four hours,
[02:44:44.580 --> 02:44:46.580]   and they go out and beat Garry Kasparov.
[02:44:47.180 --> 02:44:48.240]   (chuckles)
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:53.240]   This is, to me, this is a truly exciting development,
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:55.540]   far beyond even what Deep Blue did.
[02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:57.420]   - I like how you said exciting, not terrifying.
[02:44:57.420 --> 02:44:58.260]   - Yeah. - 'Cause I agree
[02:44:58.260 --> 02:44:59.860]   with you on the exciting. - Yeah.
[02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:03.460]   Now, things also get exciting in a different direction.
[02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:07.820]   There is another possibility which few people foresaw
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:10.060]   after the Deep Blue episode.
[02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:14.060]   This is where a new form of chess started to emerge,
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:17.280]   sometimes called cyborg chess or centaur chess,
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:23.340]   where humans of moderate chess-level playing ability,
[02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:27.020]   not world champions, just decent, but not great,
[02:45:27.020 --> 02:45:30.240]   I guess you might say like Purple Belts and Juditzen,
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:33.480]   allied themselves with computers.
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:37.480]   So the humans and computers worked as a cyborg team.
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:43.040]   The humans supplied the heuristic insight,
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:46.040]   the computers supplied the computational power.
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:51.540]   And fascinatingly, they proved to be superior
[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:55.040]   to both the best humans and the best chess programs.
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:01.020]   The united force of human insight with heuristics,
[02:46:01.020 --> 02:46:04.540]   with computers' ability to go through numbers
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:08.020]   in far more rapid form than any human could ever hope to do,
[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:10.300]   proved to be one of the strongest combinations
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:15.300]   and enabled that pairing of human and computer
[02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:18.780]   to overwhelm both the best single human
[02:46:18.780 --> 02:46:21.640]   and the best single computer.
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:26.600]   That adds a whole new level of fascination to this topic.
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:29.160]   So to wind things up here,
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:33.720]   we've got this fascinating initial question from Lex,
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.720]   the idea of could there be a computer inside a robot
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:43.640]   which doesn't have any special physical properties?
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:45.520]   This is mind versus mind,
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:46.860]   'cause the bodies negate each other.
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:49.400]   The robot is the same body as Gordon Ryan,
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:51.040]   this is a thought experiment.
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:54.120]   What would it take to create a mind
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.900]   that would defeat the mind of Gordon Ryan?
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:47:01.540]   Based on the chess example,
[02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:05.440]   it would appear that this is entirely feasible
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:06.680]   at some point in the future.
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:07.840]   And in fact, I would go further
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:09.720]   and say it's actually quite likely
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.960]   based on what we've seen from the example of chess.
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:18.240]   The rate of progress in AI in the last 20 years
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:23.860]   has dwarfed anything from the previous 50 years.
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:27.880]   And the rate continues to increase.
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:32.400]   We're talking now at a level where machine learning,
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:37.400]   defeating world champions in chess and Go in four hours,
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:41.060]   just from starting from the rules of the sport,
[02:47:41.060 --> 02:47:47.140]   this is gonna be difficult for humans to keep up with.
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:51.760]   Now in humans' favor, could we take Gordon Ryan
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:54.360]   and put a chip inside his brain
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.260]   that created the same cyborg effect
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:47:59.000]   as we saw in centaur chess and cyborg chess,
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.360]   and then take Gordon Ryan to a new level
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:03.640]   where suddenly his computational powers
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:05.040]   were massively increased.
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:07.160]   He still has this heuristic insight,
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:11.800]   but he has vastly augmented computational powers.
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:13.480]   That's the interesting battle.
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:16.720]   You asked a great question, Lex.
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:19.680]   Let me give you my initial push for an answer
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:22.520]   would be that if it's just Gordon Ryan
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:26.880]   versus your robot technology,
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:29.320]   in 10 years, I would say with machine learning,
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:32.000]   I'd say you guys win every time.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.340]   But if it is cyborg Gordon Ryan,
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:40.760]   where he's part Gordon Ryan with heuristics
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:43.880]   and part machine, and now that's where I throw
[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:48.240]   the question back at you, young man, what do you think?
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:49.760]   Well, I'm fascinated to hear your answer.
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:52.360]   - That's very interesting, 'cause there's a lot
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:55.240]   of different ways you can build a cyborg Gordon Ryan.
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:58.360]   So one is there's the Neuralink way,
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:03.360]   which is basically doing what you're suggesting,
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:07.080]   which is expanding the computational capabilities
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:11.240]   of Gordon Ryan's brain, like directly being able
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:13.640]   to communicate between a computer and the brain.
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:18.640]   So you preserve most of what there is in the human body,
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.760]   including the nervous system and the computing system
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:24.480]   we currently have that's biological
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:26.520]   and expanding it with the computer.
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:28.920]   There's also on the cyborg chess front,
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:35.360]   like Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion in chess,
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:38.760]   he studies AlphaZero games.
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:40.400]   Like it's not a regular thing
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.360]   for high-level grandmasters to do.
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:45.720]   - From what I understand, almost every chess master
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:48.880]   now studies computer games for inspiration.
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:53.880]   Like just as great chess players from the past
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:56.800]   used to go back into old leather-bound books
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:00.120]   of previous grandmasters and study games and books,
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:03.360]   nowadays most people, when they wanna study
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:05.960]   the most perfect games, they actually study programs
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:06.840]   like AlphaZero.
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:10.000]   - Yeah, and it's not just for inspiration, it's education.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.360]   I mean, it's literally part of their training regimen.
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:14.840]   This isn't like a fun side thing,
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:17.300]   it's just the main way to get better.
[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:21.400]   So there's a certain element there
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:24.400]   where even our human brains can be trained
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:29.000]   by observing the partial explorations
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:32.160]   of an AI systems in the space of grappling.
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:34.240]   That could be actually in simulation,
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:35.640]   it doesn't have to be in the physical world.
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:40.640]   It could be in, if we construct sufficiently good
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:43.920]   biomechanical models of human beings,
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:46.240]   machines can learn how they grapple.
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:49.560]   There's quite a bit of that already.
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:53.280]   OpenAI has the system of, they're like sumo wrestlers
[02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:58.000]   with some basic goals of pushing each other off of a platform
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.480]   and you know nothing from them.
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:02.360]   You don't even know, so you have a basic model
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:06.040]   of a bipedal system, it doesn't even know in the beginning
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:08.600]   how to stand up, it just falls, right?
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:10.920]   So it has to learn how to get up
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:13.040]   and they do that through self-play.
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:15.940]   They learn how to get up, they learn how to move,
[02:51:15.940 --> 02:51:18.160]   enough to achieve the final goal,
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:20.320]   which is to push your opponent off of the thing.
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:21.160]   - Fascinating.
[02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:22.680]   - So they've learned that.
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:26.480]   Now, OpenAI is not, those folks are currently
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:28.520]   not that interested in the grappling world,
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:30.200]   so they kind of stop there.
[02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:35.200]   But it's very possible in simulation to then develop ideas.
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:38.920]   In fact, this is something I should probably do,
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:41.200]   but it's pretty natural to do it easy,
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:45.040]   is ideas of control and submission and all the,
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:47.600]   you know, you add the ability to,
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:49.800]   I don't know how to put it nicely,
[02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:53.200]   but to choke your opponent
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:58.000]   and to break their body parts off,
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:01.000]   which is what Jiu-Jitsu is, add that in
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:04.000]   and what kind of ideas they'll come up with
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:05.560]   is very fascinating.
[02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:07.360]   I actually don't know, until this conversation,
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:08.840]   I don't know why I never even thought about that.
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:11.000]   I've been very obsessed with just like walking
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.880]   and running and all those kinds of things,
[02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:17.040]   like evolving different strategies for,
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:18.880]   when you have a bunch of,
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:21.240]   so one difficult thing for robots
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:22.720]   is when you have uneven terrain
[02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:24.240]   and there's uncertainty about the terrain
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:25.840]   is how to keep walking,
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:29.000]   or when there's a bunch of things being thrown at you,
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:29.960]   all that kind of stuff,
[02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:32.920]   and you learn through self-play
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:35.240]   how to be able to navigate those uncertain environments
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:37.000]   when there's a lot of weird objects
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.560]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:40.400]   There's no reason why you can't just do that
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:43.440]   with submissions and so on in simulation.
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:44.840]   That would be actually fascinating.
[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:49.040]   But once we might be surprised
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:52.280]   by the kind of strategies in simulation
[02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:54.640]   these AI systems will develop,
[02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:57.040]   and that might make a much better Gordon Ryan,
[02:52:57.040 --> 02:52:58.520]   a much better John Donahart,
[02:52:58.520 --> 02:53:01.840]   in asking the Dean Lister question of like,
[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:03.760]   why are we only using,
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:06.280]   why are we not doing X?
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:10.320]   But on the actual sort of grappling event
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:12.640]   in the physical space,
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:15.520]   I've been very surprised and a little bit disappointed
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:18.480]   by how difficult it's to build
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:25.880]   a system that's able to have the body of Gordon Ryan,
[02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:28.000]   or a human being, actually,
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:31.840]   which means it's not just the biomechanics,
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:33.680]   which is very difficult to do,
[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:37.840]   but also all of the senses that are involved,
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:40.320]   be able to perceive the world as richly,
[02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:41.880]   to be able to,
[02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:43.680]   there's something called soft robotics,
[02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:47.640]   which is incredibly difficult to do through touch,
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:50.040]   understand the hardness of things.
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:52.800]   We don't understand as human beings
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:56.200]   just how much we're able through touch
[02:53:56.200 --> 02:53:59.480]   to experience the world and to manipulate the world.
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:02.200]   Like the process of picking up a cup
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:05.240]   is very similar to the process of grappling.
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:07.160]   All the feeling that you do,
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:09.340]   all the leverage that you're applying,
[02:54:09.340 --> 02:54:11.400]   there's so many degrees of freedom
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:14.580]   in both the interactive sense,
[02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:17.080]   in the sensing and the applying, sensing and applying.
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:20.400]   You're doing that through so much of your body
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:23.620]   that it's just going to be very difficult
[02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:26.640]   to build a system that's able to experience the world
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:30.160]   and act onto the world as richly as we humans can.
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:33.080]   - Yeah, if picking up a cup
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:36.160]   is a seemingly insurmountable challenge,
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:38.400]   then taking someone down,
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.000]   controlling them, getting past their legs,
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.680]   that's going to be one hell of a project.
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:43.520]   - Exactly.
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:45.000]   I mean, there could be shortcuts,
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.440]   but I mean, currently that's the field
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:52.800]   called robotic manipulation, which is picking up objects.
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:55.680]   Usually they have like a ball and a triangular object,
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:57.640]   and your whole task is to like pick it up
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:54:59.600]   and move it around.
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:04.420]   Generalizing that to the human body is harder,
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:09.060]   but perhaps not as hard as we might think.
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:11.480]   The question is, how do you construct experiments
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:13.400]   where you can do that safely?
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:15.320]   - In chess, it's very easy.
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:18.720]   But here, it's very, very problematic.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:24.700]   I guess you could just have robot versus robot
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:27.560]   teamed up with each other, and then they learn,
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:29.460]   and then they go out to take on a human opponent.
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:30.300]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:33.240]   So you have two physical robots
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:35.360]   that interact with each other.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:37.080]   - Everything you've said so far suggests
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.400]   that many of the problems, these tactile elements,
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:43.560]   they're easy tasks for humans.
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:46.220]   So which becomes more powerful more quickly?
[02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:49.520]   Robots that are taught to think like humans,
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:52.440]   or humans that are given the computational power
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:56.960]   of computers and robots themselves?
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:55:59.920]   Which wins first, a cyborg Gordon Ryan
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:03.320]   or an artificial robot Gordon Ryan?
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:05.160]   - Really, really strong question.
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:09.720]   And I think by far the cyborg Gordon Ryan.
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:11.280]   - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking here.
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:13.160]   The problems you're talking about,
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:16.640]   with regards to the robots, those are deep problems.
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:20.040]   Like if picking up a cup is problematic,
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:22.280]   it's gonna be damn difficult.
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:25.400]   But to a human, that two-year-old can do that.
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:28.120]   - You're highlighting a very important difference
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:31.360]   is human beings have something called common sense
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:35.000]   that we don't know how to build into computers currently.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:36.740]   That's what picking up the cup is.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:41.320]   It's some basic rules about the way this world works.
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:43.400]   We're able to, this is when we're children
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:46.120]   and we'll crawl around and we pick up.
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:48.480]   What humans don't have that machines have
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:51.960]   is incredible computational power
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:54.400]   and access to infinite knowledge.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:55.440]   Computers can do that.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:57.340]   So if you have a Gordon Ryan
[02:56:57.340 --> 02:57:00.040]   with the infinite knowledge and compute power,
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:03.680]   that's just going to, because we know how to do that,
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.640]   that's going to blow out of the water
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:08.480]   a robot that's trying to learn to crawl.
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:11.920]   - Has there been any update on the phenomenon
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:14.400]   of cyborg or centaur chess?
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:16.440]   There was some debate as to whether or not
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:22.740]   cyborg chess teams could stay competitive
[02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:25.920]   with the latest machine learning.
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:27.280]   Has there been any update on that?
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:28.840]   - Yeah, I believe at this point,
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:33.840]   machines dominate over the machine human pairs.
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:37.700]   - With the human pairs, when they first came out,
[02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:41.760]   they were good chess players, but not great chess players.
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:43.880]   Does it make any difference if you have, say,
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:48.880]   Garry Kasparov and a computer working in unison
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:52.000]   versus Joe Blow from--
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:53.920]   - No, it does make a huge difference,
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:56.760]   but yeah, both are destroyed by machines at this point.
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:58.220]   - And it's not even competitive now?
[02:57:58.220 --> 02:57:59.460]   - No, it's not competitive,
[02:57:59.460 --> 02:58:03.220]   but they also lost interest in this kind of idea.
[02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:04.960]   So I think there's still competitions
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:09.220]   between human machine pairs versus human machine pairs,
[02:58:09.220 --> 02:58:12.680]   almost like to see how the two work together,
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:15.000]   but in terms of machine versus human machine pair,
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:16.040]   machines still dominate.
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:17.240]   - Interesting.
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:21.920]   - So, and now we've retrieved back as human beings
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:24.600]   caring mostly about human versus human competition,
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:27.160]   which is probably what the future will look like.
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:29.080]   It's very interesting to think,
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:32.200]   but like that in chess happened really quickly.
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:36.320]   It won't happen, and it wasn't so painful in chess
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:37.400]   'cause we care about chess,
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:40.620]   but it's not so fundamental to human society.
[02:58:40.620 --> 02:58:46.180]   And when you started talking about Cyborg Gordon Ryans,
[02:58:46.180 --> 02:58:49.160]   which really beyond grappling is referring
[02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:52.180]   to robots operating physical space
[02:58:52.180 --> 02:58:56.280]   or human robot hybrids operating physical space,
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:59:00.120]   you're talking about our society is now full of cyborgs.
[02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:00.960]   - Yes.
[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:05.160]   - And that transition might be very painful
[02:59:05.160 --> 02:59:10.160]   or transformative in a way we can't even predict.
[02:59:10.160 --> 02:59:13.800]   And that very much has applications
[02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:17.200]   as both China and US now have legalized
[02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:20.720]   is autonomous weapon systems.
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:24.920]   So use of these kinds of systems in military applications.
[02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:27.160]   So it used to be, there'd been a big call
[02:59:27.160 --> 02:59:29.640]   in the AI community to ban autonomous weapons.
[02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:33.600]   So the use of artificial intelligence in war,
[02:59:33.600 --> 02:59:37.800]   just like bioweapons are banned internationally.
[02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:40.200]   So you're not allowed to use bioweapons in war.
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:43.320]   And actually most people, even terrorists,
[02:59:43.320 --> 02:59:46.400]   have kind of agreed on this ban.
[02:59:46.400 --> 02:59:49.360]   It's not like a, there's been a quiet agreement,
[02:59:49.360 --> 02:59:51.080]   like we're not going to be doing this
[02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:54.240]   'cause everybody's gonna get really pissed off.
[02:59:54.240 --> 02:59:58.680]   With autonomous weapon systems, that's not been the case.
[02:59:58.680 --> 03:00:01.840]   What China has said that they're going to be using AI
[03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:06.720]   in their military and the US in 2021
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:10.020]   just released a report saying that they're going to,
[03:00:10.020 --> 03:00:13.720]   they're going to add increasing amounts
[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:17.280]   of artificial intelligence into our military systems,
[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:20.280]   into drones, into just everything that's doing any kind
[03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:24.320]   of both strategic and actual like bombing
[03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:27.200]   and defense systems.
[03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:32.120]   - I presume a drone army would easily defeat a human army
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:33.560]   in the near future.
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:38.560]   Like, I mean, think about, just off the top of my head,
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:41.000]   just think about the implication of kamikaze drones
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:42.320]   versus a naval fleet.
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:45.640]   I mean, kamikazes with humans in World War II
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:47.960]   did terrible damage to our Navy.
[03:00:47.960 --> 03:00:52.960]   Imagine swarms of mechanical kamikazes
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:55.000]   which have no fear, no remorse.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.000]   I mean.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.600]   - But it's very inefficient.
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:00:59.960]   Kamikaze is very inefficient.
[03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:03.440]   You want to be very, like war is,
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:06.120]   it's the same discussion to jiu-jitsu, right?
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:10.680]   You want to be, you want to create an asymmetry of power
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:11.720]   and you want to be efficient
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:13.880]   in the way you deliver that power.
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:17.080]   It actually goes back to the picking up a cup.
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:21.600]   - Currently, a lot of things we do in war,
[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:24.000]   like most of the drones that you hear about,
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.120]   they're not autonomous, not most, all.
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:27.360]   - They're usually piloted by--
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:30.160]   - They're piloted remotely by humans.
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:33.600]   And humans are really good at this kind of
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:35.700]   what's necessary to deliver the most damage,
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:39.360]   targeted damage, effective as part of the largest strategy
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:43.020]   you have about bombing the area or all that kind of stuff.
[03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:45.500]   I don't know how difficult that is to automate.
[03:01:45.500 --> 03:01:47.720]   I think the biggest concern,
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:51.600]   I actually have a sense that it's very difficult to automate.
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.840]   The biggest concern is almost like
[03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:56.040]   an incompetent application of this
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:01.120]   and consequences that are not anticipated.
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:04.960]   So you have a drone army where you say,
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:07.480]   we want to target, you give it power
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:09.720]   to target a particular terrorist.
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:14.720]   And then there's some bug in the system that has a,
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:16.980]   like for example, has a large uncertainty
[03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:18.800]   about the location of that terrorist.
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:21.000]   And so it decides to bomb an entire city.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:25.120]   Almost like there's a bug, a software bug.
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:28.480]   I'm much more concerned about bad programming
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:31.240]   and software engineering than I am about
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:36.160]   like malevolent AI systems that destroy the world.
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:38.720]   So the more we rely on automation,
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:40.160]   this is the lesson of human history,
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:45.160]   the more we give to AI, to software, to robotic systems,
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:49.680]   the more we forget how to supervise
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:52.160]   and oversee some of the edge cases,
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:54.480]   all the weird ways that things go wrong.
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:58.520]   And then the more stupid software bugs
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:02.200]   can lead to huge damage, like, you know,
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:05.680]   even like nuclear explosions, those kinds of things.
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:09.680]   If we add AI into the launch systems
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:11.460]   for nuclear weapons, for example,
[03:03:11.460 --> 03:03:17.020]   I think human history teaches us that software bugs
[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:21.040]   is what will lead to World War III,
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:25.720]   not malevolent AI or human beings.
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:26.840]   - Interesting.
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:29.480]   - By the way, I deeply appreciate how knowledgeable you are
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:31.260]   about the history of artificial intelligence.
[03:03:31.260 --> 03:03:32.100]   That was awesome.
[03:03:32.100 --> 03:03:33.640]   - Oh, no, it's fascinating stuff.
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:36.080]   You know, I remember reading when I was a child
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:38.560]   about, you know, Turing tests and things like this,
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:41.240]   and visionaries from the 1950s had ideas,
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:44.700]   but to see it come this far is just fascinating to me.
[03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:51.320]   Okay, so what can we as jujitsu players take away from this?
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:55.880]   We saw that when it comes to computers versus humans
[03:03:55.880 --> 03:04:00.880]   in chess tournaments, humans had something truly valuable
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:03.300]   to give to the computers.
[03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:05.000]   And that was heuristic rules.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:09.600]   In every coaching program that I run,
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:14.280]   I make an endless quest to search out
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:17.680]   and find effective heuristic rules.
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:20.060]   That's the basis of a good training program.
[03:04:20.060 --> 03:04:23.000]   Heuristic rules and principles
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:27.560]   give vast informational content
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:30.800]   which can rapidly increase your performance on the mat,
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:32.480]   just as they rapidly increase
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:34.440]   the performance of chess computers
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:37.160]   to overcome the human adversaries.
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:43.680]   The great human weakness is computational power.
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:48.000]   Most people vastly overestimate their ability
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.460]   to reason and problem solve under stress.
[03:04:51.460 --> 03:04:53.960]   In fact, numerous psychological studies
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:55.800]   have shown that humans can balance
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:05:00.500]   a relatively small number of competing options
[03:05:00.500 --> 03:05:03.840]   in stressful decision-making.
[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:05.060]   But what we do have,
[03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:08.440]   what is the great and unique human gift
[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:11.900]   is this idea to come up and arrive
[03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:14.160]   at heuristic rules and principles
[03:05:14.160 --> 03:05:17.920]   which turn out to be very effective guides to behavior
[03:05:17.920 --> 03:05:19.480]   for both human behavior
[03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:21.660]   and artificially intelligent behavior.
[03:05:21.660 --> 03:05:26.500]   Make that your focus in study.
[03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:30.440]   Don't try to remember 10,000 different details
[03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:31.640]   on a move, okay?
[03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:34.840]   That's human weakness, not human strength.
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:36.880]   Our strength is heuristics.
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:38.840]   Make that your focus,
[03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:42.880]   not endless computations over 25 details here
[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:44.480]   merged with 27 details here.
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:46.500]   That's not what humans are good at.
[03:05:46.500 --> 03:05:49.840]   The uniquely human strength
[03:05:49.840 --> 03:05:53.240]   is arriving at these heuristic rules and principles
[03:05:53.240 --> 03:05:54.740]   which guide our behavior,
[03:05:54.740 --> 03:05:56.920]   which provide simplifications
[03:05:56.920 --> 03:06:00.080]   which enable us to take vast amounts of information
[03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:02.160]   and parry it down to a few simple rules
[03:06:02.160 --> 03:06:04.340]   that effectively guide our behavior.
[03:06:04.340 --> 03:06:06.400]   Take that core insight from the discussion
[03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:07.400]   that Lex and I just had.
[03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:08.620]   It was a complex discussion.
[03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:10.880]   We both apologize for going a little bit overboard.
[03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:11.720]   - That was awesome.
[03:06:11.720 --> 03:06:13.160]   - And dragging you into some details there,
[03:06:13.160 --> 03:06:14.000]   but take that away from it.
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:14.840]   - I love it.
[03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:16.480]   - It'll make you better at jiu-jitsu.
[03:06:16.480 --> 03:06:17.320]   Sorry, Lex.
[03:06:17.320 --> 03:06:18.560]   - (laughs)
[03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:21.640]   That was a really exciting discussion.
[03:06:21.640 --> 03:06:25.040]   The depths of knowledge
[03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:27.400]   and the dimensions of knowledge you have
[03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:30.040]   and interest you have is just fascinating.
[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:32.900]   Is there advice you have for complete beginners,
[03:06:32.900 --> 03:06:36.440]   for white belts that are starting jiu-jitsu,
[03:06:36.440 --> 03:06:38.440]   that are listening to this, that haven't done jiu-jitsu,
[03:06:38.440 --> 03:06:42.600]   I know there's a lot of people who are super curious to start
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:45.920]   is there advice you would give them on their journey?
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:46.760]   - Yeah.
[03:06:46.760 --> 03:06:49.760]   I'm just gonna talk about just getting better on the mat.
[03:06:49.760 --> 03:06:51.280]   Okay, 'cause there's a thousand other things
[03:06:51.280 --> 03:06:54.200]   you can talk about in terms of like morale and persistence
[03:06:54.200 --> 03:06:56.240]   and how often they should train
[03:06:56.240 --> 03:06:57.080]   is a thousand things you'd get.
[03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:59.320]   - Break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend.
[03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:00.160]   - Yeah, that's one.
[03:07:00.160 --> 03:07:00.980]   No, I'm just kidding.
[03:07:00.980 --> 03:07:01.820]   Let's put that aside.
[03:07:01.820 --> 03:07:05.840]   - That's probably the best advice we could give.
[03:07:05.840 --> 03:07:07.920]   It goes back to what we said earlier.
[03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:11.980]   I always advocate start your training from the ground up.
[03:07:11.980 --> 03:07:15.640]   Okay, your first sessions in jiu-jitsu,
[03:07:15.640 --> 03:07:18.160]   you're going to find to your horror
[03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:21.420]   that everyone gets on top of you and you can't get out.
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:24.760]   And it's a dispiriting, crushing kind of feeling
[03:07:24.760 --> 03:07:26.400]   that you just have no skills
[03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:28.800]   and you have no prospects in the sport.
[03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:31.040]   So your first skill is the skill of being able
[03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:33.900]   to free yourself from positional pins.
[03:07:33.900 --> 03:07:39.040]   Most of the escapes in jiu-jitsu go to guard position.
[03:07:39.040 --> 03:07:41.480]   And so once you get someone in your guard,
[03:07:41.480 --> 03:07:43.120]   they're gonna be looking to pass your guard
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:45.160]   and get back into those positional pins
[03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:47.240]   that you just escaped from.
[03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:49.520]   And that's just as crushing as getting pinned.
[03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:51.520]   You feel like every time you try to hold someone in guard,
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:53.280]   they just effortlessly pass you by.
[03:07:53.280 --> 03:07:56.360]   So your first two skills,
[03:07:56.360 --> 03:07:58.160]   you got to be able to get out of any pin
[03:07:58.160 --> 03:08:00.280]   and you got to be able to hold someone in your guard.
[03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:02.320]   So pin escapes and guard retention
[03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:04.240]   are your first two skills.
[03:08:04.240 --> 03:08:08.780]   I generally advocate the idea of learning to fight
[03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:11.060]   from your back first
[03:08:11.060 --> 03:08:13.760]   and then learning to fight from on top second.
[03:08:13.760 --> 03:08:14.600]   Why?
[03:08:14.600 --> 03:08:16.960]   Because the brute fact is when you first start off,
[03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:19.320]   you just don't have enough skills to hold top position
[03:08:19.320 --> 03:08:21.520]   or gain top position through a takedown.
[03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:23.960]   So inevitably you're gonna end up underneath people
[03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:25.920]   for most of your training time.
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:27.960]   Your training should reflect that.
[03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:30.120]   In the early days as a white belt,
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:32.360]   start with the first two skills you need.
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:33.560]   They're not the most exciting.
[03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:35.400]   They're not sexy skills that are gonna make you look
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:36.820]   like a stud in the training room,
[03:08:36.820 --> 03:08:38.640]   but they're gonna keep you alive long enough
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:40.640]   to learn those sexy skills in the future
[03:08:40.640 --> 03:08:43.240]   that will make you look like a stud.
[03:08:43.240 --> 03:08:45.240]   Start with pin escapes,
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:49.440]   go to guard retention and focus heavily on those two.
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:51.480]   When you start to get into offense,
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:53.820]   start with bottom position.
[03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:56.960]   So there's a clear continuity between your pin escapes,
[03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:00.560]   your guard retention and then your guard itself.
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:01.380]   Okay?
[03:09:01.380 --> 03:09:03.720]   You've got different options with guard.
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:05.220]   Some of you are gonna like closed guard.
[03:09:05.220 --> 03:09:08.160]   Some of you are gonna like variations of open guard.
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:09.480]   Some of you are gonna like to be seated.
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:11.240]   Some of you are gonna like to be supine.
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:13.620]   Some of you are gonna like half guard.
[03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:17.360]   As a general rule, this is a heavy generalization,
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:18.980]   but I'm gonna give it to you.
[03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:22.440]   In my experience, most people benefit the most
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:24.880]   by starting with half guard first.
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:27.160]   I know that traditionally, Jiu-Jitsu has been taught
[03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:29.640]   closed guard first and then all the other guards
[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:30.920]   come after that.
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:34.760]   I'm a big believer in the idea of start with pin escapes,
[03:09:34.760 --> 03:09:36.400]   then go to guard retention
[03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:38.200]   and then start with half guard bottom.
[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:39.800]   That way you get a nice continuity
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:41.560]   between your first three skills
[03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:43.140]   and you'll make good progress
[03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:45.960]   over those first critical six months in Jiu-Jitsu.
[03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:50.400]   - What does it take to get a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu?
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:51.640]   - Very little.
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:53.880]   (laughing)
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:56.960]   Just show up, pay your fees.
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:00.320]   Don't set your goals low.
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:01.960]   Don't even ask yourself that question.
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:03.880]   No one cares if you got a black belt.
[03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:06.100]   The only thing that counts is the skills you have.
[03:10:06.100 --> 03:10:08.420]   I know plenty of black belts that suck.
[03:10:08.420 --> 03:10:10.920]   There's a lot of them out there.
[03:10:10.920 --> 03:10:13.880]   Don't lower your standards by saying,
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:15.400]   "I wanna get a black belt."
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:19.000]   Ask yourself something much more important.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:20.840]   How good do I wanna be?
[03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:21.960]   You wanna be damn good, right?
[03:10:21.960 --> 03:10:23.120]   You wanna do something, invest time
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:24.800]   and you wanna be the best you can.
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:27.720]   Wearing a belt around your waist doesn't guarantee that.
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:29.540]   Build skills, focus on that.
[03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:33.560]   - Let me ask you about the fourth thing
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:38.560]   in facet face of Jiu-Jitsu, which is self-defense.
[03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:41.420]   Let's say the bigger things,
[03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:44.800]   I don't know why it's called self-defense.
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:46.800]   Let's call it street fighting.
[03:10:46.800 --> 03:10:49.000]   Let's call it fighting, okay?
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.600]   Maybe you can contest that terminology.
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:53.680]   How about non-sport fighting?
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:10:54.920]   - Non-sport fighting.
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:56.000]   - It's funny, like street fighting.
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:57.400]   What happens if you go out in a playground
[03:10:57.400 --> 03:10:58.320]   and you're fighting on grass?
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:00.080]   Is that no longer street fighting?
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:00.920]   - It's like tennis.
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:03.000]   You have Wimbledon, like grass courts.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.480]   It's a whole other thing.
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:09.560]   What do you think is the best martial art
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:11.400]   for street fighting?
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:15.280]   What is the best set of, we talked about advice
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:20.280]   for white belts to advance in grappling, in Jiu-Jitsu.
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:25.800]   What is the set of techniques, maybe martial art
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:27.760]   that is best for street fighting?
[03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:32.120]   - Okay, again, you're asking some truly fascinating
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:32.960]   questions here.
[03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:39.960]   The way this gets framed as a question
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:43.460]   is often condemns you to bad answers from the start.
[03:11:43.460 --> 03:11:46.440]   This is--
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:49.940]   - As a questioner, I'm trying to achieve asymmetry of power.
[03:11:50.900 --> 03:11:51.740]   And I'm winning.
[03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:55.460]   Put you in a bad position.
[03:11:55.460 --> 03:11:59.860]   - Don't worry so much about, people are always gonna say,
[03:11:59.860 --> 03:12:01.980]   is this martial art better or is this martial art better?
[03:12:01.980 --> 03:12:06.980]   The truth is, there's only one way to say this.
[03:12:06.980 --> 03:12:09.420]   (laughing)
[03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:15.480]   Combat sports are your best option for self-defense.
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:19.860]   There are many martial arts and there is a rough divide
[03:12:19.860 --> 03:12:23.420]   between the two, those that fall into combat sports
[03:12:23.420 --> 03:12:28.380]   and those that fall into non-sporting martial arts
[03:12:28.380 --> 03:12:33.380]   where there's no competitive, live sparring element,
[03:12:33.380 --> 03:12:40.760]   where most of the knowledge is limited
[03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:44.700]   to theoretical knowledge reinforced by passive drilling.
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:49.420]   If you have a choice between a combat sport
[03:12:49.420 --> 03:12:53.980]   versus a non-sporting art based around theoretical
[03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:56.880]   knowledge and passive drilling, go with a combat sport.
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:02.060]   Nothing will prepare you for the intensity
[03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:09.260]   of a genuine altercation better than combat sports.
[03:13:09.260 --> 03:13:13.060]   Many people, as I say these words,
[03:13:13.060 --> 03:13:15.980]   they're probably horrified to hear me say this
[03:13:15.980 --> 03:13:19.500]   and immediately going to rebut and say,
[03:13:19.500 --> 03:13:23.140]   no, combat sports is exactly the wrong thing for you to do
[03:13:23.140 --> 03:13:26.620]   because they have safety rules, et cetera, et cetera,
[03:13:26.620 --> 03:13:30.280]   which would easily be exploited in a real fight.
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:32.620]   And if I fought a world championship boxer,
[03:13:32.620 --> 03:13:33.700]   I would just poke him in the eye
[03:13:33.700 --> 03:13:35.220]   or kick him in the groin, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:13:35.220 --> 03:13:38.220]   You've heard these arguments a thousand times.
[03:13:38.220 --> 03:13:40.960]   Yes, there is some validity to these things,
[03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:44.220]   but as a general rule, if you ask me to bet
[03:13:45.620 --> 03:13:48.540]   in any form of street fight, call it what you want,
[03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:52.940]   between a combat sport adherent versus someone
[03:13:52.940 --> 03:13:57.940]   who simply trains with drills and talks in terms of theories
[03:13:57.940 --> 03:14:00.980]   of what they would do in a fight,
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:04.680]   I'm gonna go with the combat sport guy every single time.
[03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:10.780]   Now, having said that, combat sports need to be modified
[03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:14.460]   for the use of self-defense street fighting.
[03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:15.660]   We haven't agreed on a term yet.
[03:14:15.660 --> 03:14:16.960]   We'll figure it out later.
[03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:21.280]   What does this modification consist of?
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:23.580]   Well, some of it is technical.
[03:14:23.580 --> 03:14:28.580]   For example, a boxer in a street fight now has to punch
[03:14:28.580 --> 03:14:32.660]   without wrapped or gloved hands, and that's problematic.
[03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:37.580]   Your hands are not really designed for heavy extended use
[03:14:37.580 --> 03:14:38.840]   of clubbing hard objects.
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:41.660]   There's a very high likelihood of breaking your hands.
[03:14:41.660 --> 03:14:44.820]   Mike Tyson was one of the finest punchers that ever lived,
[03:14:44.820 --> 03:14:46.500]   but in one of his more famous street fights
[03:14:46.500 --> 03:14:50.140]   against Mitch Green in the late 1980s,
[03:14:50.140 --> 03:14:52.900]   he broke his hand with one punch
[03:14:52.900 --> 03:14:53.860]   that he threw his opponent,
[03:14:53.860 --> 03:14:56.380]   hit the wrong part of the head and broke his hand.
[03:14:56.380 --> 03:14:58.620]   And he was one of the most gifted punchers of all time.
[03:14:58.620 --> 03:15:01.460]   If he can do it, you'll certainly have trouble
[03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:04.340]   protecting your hands when you go to throw blows.
[03:15:04.340 --> 03:15:09.660]   Nonetheless, this is easily modified.
[03:15:09.660 --> 03:15:14.660]   And so a boxer can throw with open hands or with elbows.
[03:15:14.660 --> 03:15:19.460]   And so just a small modification and technique
[03:15:19.460 --> 03:15:21.980]   can overcome that problem.
[03:15:21.980 --> 03:15:26.260]   So what you'll find is that the general physical,
[03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:28.740]   mental conditioning and skill development
[03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:30.460]   that comes from combat sports
[03:15:30.460 --> 03:15:36.260]   allied with technical modifications,
[03:15:36.260 --> 03:15:38.620]   and then the most important of all,
[03:15:38.620 --> 03:15:43.380]   tactical modifications will provide your best hope
[03:15:43.380 --> 03:15:47.300]   in altercations outside of sports in the street
[03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:49.300]   or wherever you find yourself.
[03:15:49.300 --> 03:15:55.460]   The least effective approaches to self-defense
[03:15:55.460 --> 03:15:57.700]   that I have observed in my life have been those
[03:15:57.700 --> 03:16:01.140]   where, as I said, people talked theory,
[03:16:01.140 --> 03:16:04.780]   drilled on passive opponents,
[03:16:04.780 --> 03:16:09.220]   and generally had no engagement in live competition
[03:16:09.220 --> 03:16:11.800]   or sparring in their training programs.
[03:16:11.800 --> 03:16:16.700]   The most effective by a landslide
[03:16:16.700 --> 03:16:21.700]   were those that put a heavy emphasis on live sparring
[03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:26.660]   and sporting competition modified both technically
[03:16:26.660 --> 03:16:28.820]   and tactically for the circumstances
[03:16:28.820 --> 03:16:30.380]   in which they found themselves.
[03:16:30.380 --> 03:16:34.140]   People talk, for example, about how, you know,
[03:16:35.060 --> 03:16:37.540]   and with some validity that weapons
[03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:39.620]   will change everything in a street fight.
[03:16:39.620 --> 03:16:41.380]   There's absolute truth to that,
[03:16:41.380 --> 03:16:44.660]   but this extends into weapons as well, okay?
[03:16:44.660 --> 03:16:49.660]   The most effective forms of knife fighting that you'll see
[03:16:49.660 --> 03:16:53.180]   will be those who come from a background in fencing
[03:16:53.180 --> 03:16:54.700]   because it has sparring
[03:16:54.700 --> 03:16:56.940]   and a competitive sport aspect to it.
[03:16:56.940 --> 03:16:59.340]   But would pure fencing be the appropriate thing?
[03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:01.040]   Of course not, you'd have to modify it.
[03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:04.020]   But the reflexes, endurance, physical mobility
[03:17:04.020 --> 03:17:05.820]   that you gain from the sport of fencing
[03:17:05.820 --> 03:17:08.180]   could easily be modified to blade craft
[03:17:08.180 --> 03:17:10.600]   in a fight situation.
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:13.300]   What you want to look for with regards
[03:17:13.300 --> 03:17:16.860]   street and self-defense is not,
[03:17:16.860 --> 03:17:18.380]   okay, which style should I choose?
[03:17:18.380 --> 03:17:19.500]   Should I choose Taekwondo?
[03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:20.460]   Should I choose karate?
[03:17:20.460 --> 03:17:22.500]   Should I choose this variation of Kung Fu?
[03:17:22.500 --> 03:17:25.000]   No, focus on the most important thing.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.700]   Does it have a sport aspect to it?
[03:17:27.700 --> 03:17:30.100]   Then once you've made sufficient progress
[03:17:30.100 --> 03:17:32.200]   in the sport aspect of that martial art,
[03:17:32.200 --> 03:17:35.600]   start asking yourself what are the requisite modifications
[03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:38.620]   and technique and tactics that I have to use
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:43.620]   or to input to make it effective for street situations?
[03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:45.640]   That's always the advice that I give.
[03:17:45.640 --> 03:17:47.600]   Let me zoom in on a very particular aspect
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:50.920]   of street fighting where with all due respect,
[03:17:50.920 --> 03:17:54.700]   I disagree with Mr. Joe Rogan and George St. Pierre on,
[03:17:54.700 --> 03:17:57.960]   which is the suit and tie situation.
[03:17:57.960 --> 03:18:00.200]   Now to criticize GSB, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[03:18:00.200 --> 03:18:01.560]   he's very accomplished and everything,
[03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:03.480]   but to criticize him for a bit,
[03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:07.320]   he made claims about how dangerous the tie is
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:11.340]   in a street fighting situation without ever having used it
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:12.800]   in a fighting situation.
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:15.960]   So he made sort of broad proclamations
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:18.480]   without understanding the fundamentals.
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:23.240]   So I thought I would go to somebody who thinks in systems.
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:29.360]   What do you think, is it dangerous to wear a tie or not
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:33.280]   in a grappling situation versus all the other weapons?
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:35.520]   - We're talking about in a street fight here.
[03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:37.280]   'Cause it'd be rather strange to wear a tie
[03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:38.440]   in a grappling competition.
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:40.480]   - It would be, it would be.
[03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:42.920]   Yes, in a street fight situation.
[03:18:42.920 --> 03:18:47.640]   Joe Rogan thinks it is like the most dangerous,
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:51.100]   it's like it becomes your weakest point if you wear a tie
[03:18:51.100 --> 03:18:52.960]   because it's very easy to choke.
[03:18:52.960 --> 03:18:55.240]   George St. Pierre seemed to have agreed with that.
[03:18:55.240 --> 03:18:59.020]   Also George added that you can grab the tie
[03:18:59.020 --> 03:19:03.120]   and pull the person down to a knee.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:04.520]   Yeah, this is the go-to.
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:06.040]   Joe Rogan will go for the choke,
[03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:08.700]   George St. Pierre will go for the tie to the knee,
[03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:10.600]   which I was saying is ridiculous.
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:11.560]   So what do you think?
[03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:15.100]   - Okay, first off, I actually can speak with experience
[03:19:15.100 --> 03:19:17.800]   on this 'cause I worked as a bouncer for over a decade
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:19.920]   and most of the clubs I worked at
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:22.820]   did not require a suit and tie, but occasionally they did.
[03:19:22.820 --> 03:19:28.500]   Okay, let's first differentiate between the kinds of threats
[03:19:28.500 --> 03:19:30.100]   when you wear a tie.
[03:19:30.100 --> 03:19:33.200]   If you wear a tie, if there is gonna be a threat,
[03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:36.560]   by far the more important threat is not strangulation.
[03:19:36.560 --> 03:19:40.240]   Okay, being strangled by your tie is possible,
[03:19:40.240 --> 03:19:42.120]   but it is a poor choice.
[03:19:42.120 --> 03:19:43.920]   There are many other ways to strangle people
[03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:45.160]   that are far more efficient.
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:49.320]   If I strangle by your tie, I'm literally in front of you.
[03:19:49.320 --> 03:19:52.400]   That means as I go to apply the stranglehold,
[03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:54.240]   I can easily be eye gouged, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:19:54.240 --> 03:19:56.160]   If you're gonna strangle people in the street,
[03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:59.220]   do it from behind and there's just much better ways
[03:19:59.220 --> 03:20:00.060]   to do it than that.
[03:20:00.060 --> 03:20:01.120]   - Hear that Joe Rogan?
[03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:04.860]   - With regards to the snap down question,
[03:20:04.860 --> 03:20:07.300]   that is more a problem.
[03:20:07.300 --> 03:20:09.740]   I always recommend if you are going to work as a bouncer
[03:20:09.740 --> 03:20:12.820]   with a tie, wear a clip-on tie
[03:20:12.820 --> 03:20:14.460]   so it just comes off immediately.
[03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:17.780]   If you don't like clip-ons, then you can use a bow tie.
[03:20:17.780 --> 03:20:22.220]   I used to work for years in hip hop clubs
[03:20:22.220 --> 03:20:26.320]   with members of the Nation of Islam security team
[03:20:26.320 --> 03:20:28.600]   that were known, they had various factions,
[03:20:28.600 --> 03:20:30.680]   but the one I worked with were the X-Men
[03:20:30.680 --> 03:20:32.280]   and they would always wear bow ties,
[03:20:32.280 --> 03:20:34.040]   which of course can't be grabbed.
[03:20:34.040 --> 03:20:39.040]   Now, the bow tie was a recognizable part of their brand
[03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:42.280]   as security guards, so everyone knew
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:43.880]   that that's what they wore.
[03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:46.960]   If I wore a bow tie in a security situation,
[03:20:46.960 --> 03:20:48.600]   people would probably think that I was some kind
[03:20:48.600 --> 03:20:52.420]   of Nancy boy and want to fight with me,
[03:20:52.420 --> 03:20:53.820]   so I couldn't wear one.
[03:20:53.820 --> 03:20:58.180]   So I would always wear a tie which you should become familiar
[03:20:58.180 --> 03:21:02.860]   with Mr. Freedman, that's the Texas Bolo tie,
[03:21:02.860 --> 03:21:04.980]   which is a kind of shoestring tie,
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:07.060]   which is very, very thin, almost like shoestring
[03:21:07.060 --> 03:21:09.540]   and rather short and just has a simple pendant
[03:21:09.540 --> 03:21:11.140]   in the middle.
[03:21:11.140 --> 03:21:13.260]   This is perfect if you need to wear a tie
[03:21:13.260 --> 03:21:16.220]   in a situation where you believe there's a high likelihood
[03:21:16.220 --> 03:21:17.940]   of you being grabbed by--
[03:21:17.940 --> 03:21:18.900]   - Because it can't be grabbed.
[03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:19.860]   - Yeah, there's nothing to grab.
[03:21:19.860 --> 03:21:20.940]   It's literally like string.
[03:21:20.940 --> 03:21:24.340]   Like if you pulled it, it would just slip through your hand.
[03:21:24.340 --> 03:21:26.780]   That tie that you're wearing now,
[03:21:26.780 --> 03:21:29.460]   that would give me tremendous control of your head
[03:21:29.460 --> 03:21:32.820]   and I could easily turn it into a hockey fight situation
[03:21:32.820 --> 03:21:35.380]   where your head was being pulled down out of balance
[03:21:35.380 --> 03:21:37.480]   and you would have a hard time recovering.
[03:21:37.480 --> 03:21:41.800]   So strangulation, not really a problem.
[03:21:41.800 --> 03:21:44.960]   Getting pulled down, possible problem.
[03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:48.480]   Solutions, clip-on tie, bow tie,
[03:21:48.480 --> 03:21:50.720]   or if you don't wanna look like a Nancy boy,
[03:21:50.720 --> 03:21:54.200]   wear a Bolo tie.
[03:21:54.200 --> 03:21:55.880]   - Beautiful, so you disagree with Joe Rogan
[03:21:55.880 --> 03:21:58.280]   and agree with George St. Pierre, I love it.
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:01.360]   I feel like this is an instruction we put together
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:06.260]   on street fighting and the tie.
[03:22:06.260 --> 03:22:11.260]   Speaking of Joe Rogan, let me ask the following question.
[03:22:11.560 --> 03:22:14.920]   He's currently doing a podcast with Gordon Ryan
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:20.880]   and probably going to try to convince him and you,
[03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:23.160]   as he's already been doing, to move to Austin.
[03:22:23.160 --> 03:22:27.600]   What are the chances of the Donahue Death Squad
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:30.960]   coming to Austin and opening a school in Austin
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:34.700]   and making Austin home so I can attend the classes there?
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:36.960]   - I would definitely have to think about that.
[03:22:37.880 --> 03:22:42.880]   I do know that I personally love New York,
[03:22:42.880 --> 03:22:48.920]   but every single person in the squad despised New York
[03:22:48.920 --> 03:22:51.280]   and wanted to leave for a long time.
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:57.120]   - What was the nature of your love for New York, by the way?
[03:22:57.120 --> 03:22:59.760]   - It was truly an international city.
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:03.920]   I'm a big believer in the idea of breadth of experience.
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:07.520]   And if you want, breadth of experience
[03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:09.800]   usually requires extensive travel,
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:14.240]   but training people means you have to be in a fixed location
[03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:16.600]   working according to a schedule.
[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:21.600]   And that pushed, those two push in different directions.
[03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:24.340]   New York was the compromise where everyone
[03:23:24.340 --> 03:23:26.480]   from around the world came there.
[03:23:26.480 --> 03:23:29.240]   So you had breadth of experience of world culture,
[03:23:29.240 --> 03:23:31.400]   but at the same time you had a fixed location.
[03:23:31.400 --> 03:23:32.840]   So you could run a training program
[03:23:32.840 --> 03:23:34.460]   that produced world champions.
[03:23:34.460 --> 03:23:36.080]   So it was the ideal compromise.
[03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:40.560]   It was a fascinating thing to teach classes
[03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:43.560]   of over 120 people where literally the entire world
[03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:46.640]   was represented on the map and go outside
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:48.840]   and see the same thing.
[03:23:48.840 --> 03:23:53.840]   It was truly the world's leading international city.
[03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:58.680]   It was like the world's unofficial capital,
[03:23:58.680 --> 03:24:00.680]   fascinating place to live.
[03:24:00.680 --> 03:24:03.080]   So I loved it, but the squad hated it.
[03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:05.000]   For them it was like an expensive,
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:08.800]   things they never actually lived in Manhattan.
[03:24:08.800 --> 03:24:10.920]   They always lived in New Jersey or Long Island,
[03:24:10.920 --> 03:24:11.760]   had to commute in.
[03:24:11.760 --> 03:24:14.060]   So all they ever saw was the bridges and the tunnels,
[03:24:14.060 --> 03:24:16.680]   the expensive daily parking fees.
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:18.880]   They only saw the worst of New York.
[03:24:18.880 --> 03:24:22.640]   And despite my pleas for them to move into Manhattan,
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:23.700]   they never did.
[03:24:23.700 --> 03:24:25.680]   And so they hated it.
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:27.400]   'Cause when all you see of New York
[03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:31.200]   is the bridges and the tunnels and the parking garage,
[03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:32.840]   that's not a pleasant thing.
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:35.440]   So I understand where they're coming from.
[03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:37.920]   So then when COVID broke out,
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:44.800]   they wanted to move to Puerto Rico and work there.
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:49.400]   Now, Puerto Rico is a beautiful alternative to New York.
[03:24:49.400 --> 03:24:52.760]   It's in many ways, has many advantages over New York.
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:54.080]   It's physically beautiful.
[03:24:54.080 --> 03:24:56.240]   The people are wonderful.
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:25:01.780]   It's just a wonderful place to spend time.
[03:25:02.780 --> 03:25:06.340]   - Freedom, low taxes, all those kinds of things
[03:25:06.340 --> 03:25:08.180]   that Puerto Rico stands for.
[03:25:08.180 --> 03:25:10.260]   - It's Texas on the other hand.
[03:25:10.260 --> 03:25:11.100]   I know everyone in the squad--
[03:25:11.100 --> 03:25:12.180]   - It's a compromise, right?
[03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:14.220]   Texas is a compromise between those two.
[03:25:14.220 --> 03:25:17.060]   - Actually, I must say that everyone on the squad,
[03:25:17.060 --> 03:25:19.360]   myself included, loves Texas.
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:21.820]   There's no question about that.
[03:25:21.820 --> 03:25:24.260]   I know Gordon loves it.
[03:25:24.260 --> 03:25:29.260]   Gary, Craig, Nikki, everyone who comes here just loves Texas.
[03:25:29.260 --> 03:25:31.360]   That is incontestable.
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:37.200]   Of course, in Texas, there's many great cities.
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:41.080]   Austin has always been one of my favorites.
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:43.280]   I love Dallas, I love Austin.
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:49.760]   And it has the advantages of better infrastructure
[03:25:49.760 --> 03:25:53.000]   as a place to train.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.480]   It has a much higher population density
[03:25:55.480 --> 03:25:57.600]   so that you could get a larger number
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:00.020]   of prospective students and form a larger squad.
[03:26:01.020 --> 03:26:06.020]   It would definitely be a fantastic place to open up a gym.
[03:26:06.020 --> 03:26:09.860]   I couldn't give an answer off the top of my head.
[03:26:09.860 --> 03:26:12.420]   It would be a big move if we did make that move.
[03:26:12.420 --> 03:26:18.380]   But the basic idea would be very agreeable
[03:26:18.380 --> 03:26:20.740]   to everyone on the team, I will say that.
[03:26:20.740 --> 03:26:25.320]   - Well, I'll just have to call my Russian connections
[03:26:25.320 --> 03:26:27.220]   to threaten the right kind of people.
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:32.420]   I definitely would love the way you approach training,
[03:26:32.420 --> 03:26:34.100]   the way you approach the martial arts
[03:26:34.100 --> 03:26:38.580]   is something that I deeply admire
[03:26:38.580 --> 03:26:40.180]   as a scholar of these arts.
[03:26:40.180 --> 03:26:42.460]   So it would be amazing if you do come here,
[03:26:42.460 --> 03:26:45.780]   but either way, it'd be amazing to train together.
[03:26:45.780 --> 03:26:47.960]   Let me ask a big, ridiculous question.
[03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:53.120]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:55.780]   We talked about at the beginning of the conversation
[03:26:55.780 --> 03:26:59.040]   about death and the fear of it.
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:04.300]   The other big question we ask about life is its meaning.
[03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:07.060]   Do you think there's a meaning to our existence here
[03:27:07.060 --> 03:27:09.740]   on this little spinning ball?
[03:27:09.740 --> 03:27:13.580]   - That's, you've thrown some powerful questions.
[03:27:13.580 --> 03:27:14.820]   That's the most powerful.
[03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:23.180]   For most of human existence,
[03:27:23.180 --> 03:27:29.240]   the meaning of life was very, very simple, survival.
[03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:35.460]   The only thing that humans cared about was just surviving,
[03:27:35.460 --> 03:27:38.340]   because it was so damn difficult
[03:27:38.340 --> 03:27:40.940]   for the early years of human existence on this earth.
[03:27:40.940 --> 03:27:48.740]   If you look at ourselves as biological agents,
[03:27:48.860 --> 03:27:52.060]   everything about our body is set up for one mission,
[03:27:52.060 --> 03:27:53.140]   and that is survival.
[03:27:53.140 --> 03:27:58.860]   Every reflex we have, every element of our structure
[03:27:58.860 --> 03:28:01.380]   is just built up on the battle to survive.
[03:28:01.380 --> 03:28:05.400]   And then humans did something remarkable.
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:13.080]   They elevated themselves through the use of technology
[03:28:13.080 --> 03:28:16.900]   and social structure to the top of the food chain
[03:28:18.580 --> 03:28:23.580]   so that they went from extremely vulnerable.
[03:28:23.580 --> 03:28:27.100]   If you take a naked human being alone
[03:28:27.100 --> 03:28:29.460]   and put them in the Serengeti Plains in Africa,
[03:28:29.460 --> 03:28:32.420]   they're in some deep shit, okay?
[03:28:32.420 --> 03:28:36.020]   If you look at a human being as a survival organism
[03:28:36.020 --> 03:28:37.660]   just by itself, naked,
[03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:42.860]   they are among the most feeble at that task
[03:28:42.860 --> 03:28:44.480]   in the entire animal kingdom.
[03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:47.040]   (inhales)
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:52.480]   You compare us with predatory animals.
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:57.240]   We are weak and soft and easily killed.
[03:28:57.240 --> 03:29:03.840]   But if you take that same human and put them in a group
[03:29:03.840 --> 03:29:07.580]   and you give them basic technology,
[03:29:07.580 --> 03:29:12.580]   steel, a spear, a knife,
[03:29:14.320 --> 03:29:16.360]   he goes from the bottom of the food chain
[03:29:16.360 --> 03:29:19.020]   to pretty much at the top.
[03:29:19.020 --> 03:29:25.880]   And so humanity found itself in a crisis
[03:29:25.880 --> 03:29:28.640]   that emerged out of its own success.
[03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:30.560]   For most of its history,
[03:29:30.560 --> 03:29:32.420]   their only interest was the battle to survive,
[03:29:32.420 --> 03:29:33.520]   and they did it.
[03:29:33.520 --> 03:29:34.880]   I don't know how they did it, but they did it.
[03:29:34.880 --> 03:29:38.180]   They got through ice ages, droughts, famines,
[03:29:38.180 --> 03:29:40.900]   disease, everything, and they found a way
[03:29:40.900 --> 03:29:42.700]   to get to the top of the food chain.
[03:29:43.700 --> 03:29:47.740]   And that's where it all got interesting.
[03:29:47.740 --> 03:29:51.620]   'Cause an organism whose only interest was in survival
[03:29:51.620 --> 03:29:54.020]   had for the first time in their history
[03:29:54.020 --> 03:29:56.840]   a more or less guaranteed survival.
[03:29:56.840 --> 03:30:03.540]   And so the big question now is, now what?
[03:30:03.540 --> 03:30:04.780]   We survived.
[03:30:04.780 --> 03:30:06.280]   There's no more danger.
[03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:09.540]   The average human being finds himself in a world now
[03:30:09.540 --> 03:30:14.180]   where there's almost zero danger from predatory animals,
[03:30:14.180 --> 03:30:18.740]   where getting a meal is the easiest thing ever,
[03:30:18.740 --> 03:30:23.600]   where getting to and from work is not problematic at all,
[03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:27.900]   where the majority of infectious diseases,
[03:30:27.900 --> 03:30:31.300]   medical complaints can be resolved
[03:30:31.300 --> 03:30:33.160]   in a hospital fairly easily.
[03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:38.300]   And so they start casting their mind around,
[03:30:38.300 --> 03:30:40.380]   okay, what do I do now?
[03:30:40.380 --> 03:30:47.020]   And so the minute mankind's existence
[03:30:47.020 --> 03:30:48.940]   became more or less guaranteed,
[03:30:48.940 --> 03:30:55.140]   the problem shift from survival to meaning.
[03:30:55.140 --> 03:31:00.800]   And we found ourselves grappling with a whole new issue
[03:31:00.800 --> 03:31:03.360]   that had never occurred to our ancient forefathers,
[03:31:03.360 --> 03:31:07.580]   but which now becomes one of the centerpieces
[03:31:07.580 --> 03:31:09.000]   of our modern lives.
[03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:12.740]   - I mean, when you look at your own life,
[03:31:12.740 --> 03:31:17.740]   when you look back, you think, I did a hell of a good job.
[03:31:17.740 --> 03:31:20.620]   You know, Hunter S. Thompson has this line
[03:31:20.620 --> 03:31:21.860]   that I often think about,
[03:31:21.860 --> 03:31:25.260]   "That life should not be a journey to the grave
[03:31:25.260 --> 03:31:27.980]   with the intention of arriving safely
[03:31:27.980 --> 03:31:30.920]   in a pretty and well-preserved body,
[03:31:30.920 --> 03:31:35.300]   but rather to skid in roadside in a cloud of smoke,
[03:31:35.300 --> 03:31:37.420]   thoroughly used up, totally worn out,
[03:31:37.420 --> 03:31:40.520]   and loudly proclaiming, 'Wow, what a ride.'"
[03:31:40.520 --> 03:31:41.780]   (John laughs)
[03:31:41.780 --> 03:31:44.960]   That's which is the complete opposite of survival.
[03:31:44.960 --> 03:31:47.820]   Well, not complete opposite of survival,
[03:31:47.820 --> 03:31:52.820]   but basically embracing danger, embracing risk, going big,
[03:31:52.820 --> 03:31:55.160]   just living life to the fullest.
[03:31:55.160 --> 03:31:58.140]   So within that context,
[03:31:58.140 --> 03:32:04.060]   what would make you proud of a life well-lived?
[03:32:04.060 --> 03:32:05.820]   When you look back, you, John Donahart,
[03:32:05.820 --> 03:32:07.740]   looking back at your life.
[03:32:07.740 --> 03:32:09.700]   - First, I will address that question,
[03:32:09.700 --> 03:32:13.860]   but let's first look at why Hunter Thompson could say that,
[03:32:13.860 --> 03:32:17.180]   because his life was more or less guaranteed and safe.
[03:32:17.180 --> 03:32:20.060]   If you look at animals in the animal kingdom,
[03:32:20.060 --> 03:32:22.120]   the pattern of their life is very simple.
[03:32:22.120 --> 03:32:25.980]   They take the least risk possible to secure their existence.
[03:32:25.980 --> 03:32:29.840]   Lions are powerful creatures, but when they go hunting,
[03:32:29.840 --> 03:32:32.820]   they typically go for the weakest animals they can kill
[03:32:32.820 --> 03:32:34.820]   in order to eat, 'cause they don't wanna take the risk
[03:32:34.820 --> 03:32:38.540]   of injuring themselves, knowing that if they do, they die.
[03:32:38.540 --> 03:32:41.100]   So the brute reality is the only people
[03:32:41.100 --> 03:32:46.100]   who can talk about having casual danger in their lives
[03:32:46.100 --> 03:32:48.820]   are those whose lives are guaranteed.
[03:32:48.820 --> 03:32:51.500]   - In a fascinating small tangent,
[03:32:51.500 --> 03:32:53.400]   Hunter Thompson took his own life.
[03:32:53.400 --> 03:32:58.100]   So that seems like a deeply human thing, the suicide.
[03:32:58.100 --> 03:32:58.940]   - Yes.
[03:32:58.940 --> 03:33:02.620]   That's a fascinating question in itself.
[03:33:02.620 --> 03:33:07.020]   If you look at the number of suicides per year,
[03:33:07.020 --> 03:33:09.060]   it's a shocking, shocking statistic
[03:33:09.060 --> 03:33:11.140]   that gets almost no recognition.
[03:33:11.140 --> 03:33:12.740]   And yes, uniquely human.
[03:33:12.740 --> 03:33:16.860]   You don't, very, very few animals you see killing themselves
[03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:18.860]   because their whole thing is just survival,
[03:33:18.860 --> 03:33:20.700]   and that humans, paradoxically,
[03:33:20.700 --> 03:33:22.620]   when survival is more or less guaranteed,
[03:33:22.620 --> 03:33:24.700]   are killing themselves in vast numbers.
[03:33:24.700 --> 03:33:28.180]   It's usually linked back to the idea of meaning,
[03:33:28.180 --> 03:33:30.540]   because it's so hard.
[03:33:30.540 --> 03:33:34.680]   It was hard to win the battle for survival,
[03:33:34.680 --> 03:33:37.620]   but it's 10 times harder to win the battle for meaning.
[03:33:37.620 --> 03:33:45.580]   When I think about it, first off,
[03:33:45.580 --> 03:33:46.660]   I'll say right from the bat,
[03:33:46.660 --> 03:33:51.660]   there's never going to be an agreed-upon sense of meaning.
[03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:55.300]   As I said, there was one thing
[03:33:55.300 --> 03:33:57.900]   that our physical bodies agreed upon,
[03:33:57.900 --> 03:34:00.660]   and which is hardwired biologically into us,
[03:34:00.660 --> 03:34:01.780]   and that's survival.
[03:34:01.780 --> 03:34:05.060]   But once we got to a more or less guaranteed survival,
[03:34:05.060 --> 03:34:06.060]   then all bets were off.
[03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:09.460]   At that point, you just have to start
[03:34:09.460 --> 03:34:10.860]   listing your own criteria.
[03:34:10.860 --> 03:34:13.380]   And what one person will describe as a meaningful life,
[03:34:13.380 --> 03:34:17.580]   another person will decry as meaningless or wasted.
[03:34:17.580 --> 03:34:24.820]   There's something terrible about the idea
[03:34:24.820 --> 03:34:27.500]   that we're sitting around, waiting for meaning
[03:34:27.500 --> 03:34:29.260]   to show up on our doorstep.
[03:34:29.260 --> 03:34:31.020]   But what I find the best people do
[03:34:31.020 --> 03:34:32.100]   is they take charge of it,
[03:34:32.100 --> 03:34:36.940]   and they look at their lives in a form of authorship,
[03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:41.460]   where they see their life as a tale to be written,
[03:34:41.460 --> 03:34:44.340]   and they do their best to write that tale
[03:34:44.340 --> 03:34:48.760]   and put as much control over the direction of the story
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:49.700]   as they can.
[03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:57.140]   In the end, we all have to just try and write our own story.
[03:34:57.140 --> 03:34:59.060]   We all have our own interests.
[03:34:59.060 --> 03:35:03.900]   I try to bring in the sense that,
[03:35:03.900 --> 03:35:05.860]   even though I'm an atheist,
[03:35:05.860 --> 03:35:10.060]   I don't believe that we go on to live after this.
[03:35:10.060 --> 03:35:12.340]   I believe that there's a possibility
[03:35:12.340 --> 03:35:13.900]   of a God and an afterlife.
[03:35:13.900 --> 03:35:15.540]   I don't say it's impossible,
[03:35:15.540 --> 03:35:18.460]   but in order for me to believe that they exist,
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:21.260]   I'd have to see better evidence than I see currently.
[03:35:21.260 --> 03:35:26.860]   Nonetheless, I do believe that there is a great value
[03:35:26.860 --> 03:35:31.200]   in the idea of living for something bigger than yourself.
[03:35:31.200 --> 03:35:34.540]   The moment you see yourself as the be-all
[03:35:34.540 --> 03:35:36.440]   and end-all of your existence,
[03:35:36.440 --> 03:35:38.220]   you're in for a meaningless life,
[03:35:38.220 --> 03:35:40.260]   and nothing will ever satisfy you.
[03:35:40.260 --> 03:35:41.620]   You can have all the money in the world,
[03:35:41.620 --> 03:35:42.860]   you can have all the power in the world,
[03:35:42.860 --> 03:35:44.180]   you'll be empty inside.
[03:35:44.180 --> 03:35:49.940]   I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need
[03:35:49.940 --> 03:35:53.940]   to follow the interests of a group
[03:35:53.940 --> 03:35:56.580]   bigger than themselves as an individual.
[03:35:56.580 --> 03:35:58.480]   Is it ideal?
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:35:59.320]   No.
[03:35:59.320 --> 03:36:00.940]   Is it an answer to the meaning of life?
[03:36:00.940 --> 03:36:03.580]   Nope, because eventually that group will itself die out.
[03:36:03.580 --> 03:36:06.660]   So there's a sense in which it just plays
[03:36:06.660 --> 03:36:07.940]   a kind of delaying game.
[03:36:07.940 --> 03:36:15.700]   But I do believe that in order to live a happy life,
[03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:19.300]   meaning is a central part of that,
[03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:21.100]   and the deepest sense of meaning,
[03:36:21.100 --> 03:36:23.860]   not a fully complete answer,
[03:36:23.860 --> 03:36:25.540]   but a better answer than most people give
[03:36:25.540 --> 03:36:30.540]   is to find something which hopefully does very little harm
[03:36:30.540 --> 03:36:34.740]   to the people around you and mostly benefits them,
[03:36:34.740 --> 03:36:38.460]   which enables you to become part of a community
[03:36:38.460 --> 03:36:42.020]   and to live, as I said,
[03:36:42.020 --> 03:36:44.880]   for something larger than you as an individual.
[03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:50.100]   If there is such a thing as a perfect conversation,
[03:36:50.100 --> 03:36:55.100]   it would be a conversation on death, meaning, and robots.
[03:36:55.100 --> 03:37:00.580]   With the great John Donahuer, John, I've been a fan.
[03:37:00.580 --> 03:37:04.540]   It's a huge honor that you would waste all your time today.
[03:37:04.540 --> 03:37:05.700]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:08.020]   - My pleasure, thank you, Lex.
[03:37:08.020 --> 03:37:09.540]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:37:09.540 --> 03:37:12.620]   with John Donahuer, and thank you to Onnit,
[03:37:12.620 --> 03:37:15.740]   Simply Safe, Indeed, and Linode.
[03:37:15.740 --> 03:37:19.200]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:21.340]   And now, let me leave you some words
[03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:23.540]   from John Donahuer himself.
[03:37:23.540 --> 03:37:27.820]   In fighting and competition, the objective is victory.
[03:37:27.820 --> 03:37:31.260]   In training, the objective is skill development.
[03:37:31.260 --> 03:37:33.060]   Do not confuse them.
[03:37:33.060 --> 03:37:35.140]   As such, one of the best ways to train
[03:37:35.140 --> 03:37:38.580]   is to identify the strengths of your various partners
[03:37:38.580 --> 03:37:41.580]   and regularly expose yourself to those strengths.
[03:37:41.580 --> 03:37:45.240]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:47.820]   (upbeat music)
[03:37:47.820 --> 03:37:50.400]   (upbeat music)
