[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   We are talking with our friend Trip Lee.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.900]   Trip, in your new book Rise, you write this, quote,
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.900]   "To put it simply, procrastination is pride
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.920]   "because it assumes you know the future,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880]   "but we don't know when our health will decline
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.720]   "or our lives will end.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.640]   "We don't even know for sure when life will get busier."
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.080]   End quote.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.760]   Knowing that our time is short helps to bring clarity
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.560]   to our daily priorities, of course,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.880]   and it makes us diligent in those priorities.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.760]   So explain how this relates to procrastination.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.720]   Well, you know, I feel very experienced
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   in writing about procrastination
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.920]   because that's been something that's been an issue for me
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.760]   of my lifetime.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.880]   Management was not a natural strength to me.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.400]   And, you know, especially in my college years,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.040]   time management and procrastination would pop up a lot
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.840]   and got really convicted me.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.160]   When I say to myself over and over again,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.400]   you know what, I'll do this later.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.680]   I'm assuming that I'll have a later.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.560]   I'm assuming that I'll have the time to do that
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.680]   at some other time.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.820]   And that's just knowledge that I don't really have.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080]   You know, it's just like what James says,
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.040]   and James too, when he says,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.000]   "Come now, you who say today or tomorrow,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.760]   "we will go into such and such a town
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.280]   "and spend a year there and trade and make profit.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.780]   "Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.620]   "What is your life?
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.460]   "For you are missed.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.620]   "It appears for little time and advantages.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.680]   "Instead you ought to say,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.200]   "if the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.880]   And I think one of the principles there
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.320]   is it's very proud to say with certainty
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.880]   that today or tomorrow, you'll do this or that.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.580]   And so then when we begin to think about procrastination,
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.680]   if I have a task that needs to be done,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.640]   and I say, you know what, I'm gonna just do that later.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.760]   I'm assuming that I have God's sovereign knowledge
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.840]   of all things,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.040]   and that I'm definitely gonna be able to do that.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.000]   And so what that does for me is
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800]   it helps me to think a lot more carefully
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.680]   about the way that I'm spending my time,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   that I wouldn't be so proud assuming that this time right now
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.000]   that I have belongs to me,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.520]   when it really belongs to God,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.180]   or assuming that I'll get to have more time later.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.880]   This becomes really clear with kids,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.080]   where, you know, when I was single and unmarried,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   there was more chance of me always having time
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.900]   to do other things.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.200]   But now that I have kids,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.360]   it's like the Lord has given me
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   a little illustration of reminder
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.360]   that you can't get time back.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.960]   And so you have to use the time that you have
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.640]   very, very carefully,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.700]   even beyond just other things coming up.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.520]   We don't know for sure that our life will be extended.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.720]   And so, you know,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.640]   the only thing that I know about is right now.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.400]   The only moment I know that I'll have
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.000]   is the one I'm in right now.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.200]   And that has to change my approach to things.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.360]   So for instance, when I meet a friend in my neighborhood,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.080]   and I feel led to tell them about Jesus,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.960]   and I think, man, I need to share the gospel with them.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.400]   I can't just always assume I'll do that next week,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.820]   I'll do that next year,
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.160]   because I just don't know
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   that I'll get it next week or next year.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.560]   And I have to be faithful.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.840]   The moment I know that I have
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   to share the gospel with them is right now.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360]   And of course, there's balance to that.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.080]   You know, it doesn't mean I have to hop out of the car
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.760]   every time I drive by somebody.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.140]   But I do have to think carefully,
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.240]   God has given me this moment right now.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.080]   How can I use my right now to be faithful to him?
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.760]   And, you know, move forward and use every moment
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.960]   to be faithful instead of putting stuff off.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.300]   - Amen, what a great word for us all, brother, thank you.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.140]   And Tripoli's latest album and his new book
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.140]   are both titled Rise.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.560]   You can get them at Amazon.com right now.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.680]   I quoted from the book earlier in the podcast.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.680]   Well, Trip is a writer, and so of course he is a reader.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.640]   And we get one more episode with Tripoli,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.440]   and I wanna ask him what books have most impacted his life
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   and his ministry.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.260]   That's tomorrow.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhke.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.320]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.580]   with guest Tripoli.
