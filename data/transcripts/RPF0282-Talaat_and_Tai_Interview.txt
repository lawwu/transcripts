[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   You know, there are a lot of great things about being married, but you know what one
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.280]   of the best things about being married is?
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.720]   Money!
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.640]   After all, the day you get married, it just becomes easy.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.480]   Life is so easy when you get to manage money with another person.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.080]   It's just remarkable.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.400]   Everything flows smoothly.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.840]   You always agree on everything.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.960]   Wait, that's not your experience?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.960]   Oh, bummer.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.120]   Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, radicals.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:57.640]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.480]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today we're here to talk about money and marriage.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.440]   The good thing is I'm not alone.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.160]   I've got Talit and Ty from His and Hers Money.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.320]   They're here to share a little bit of their experience, a little bit of their wisdom,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:22.120]   and hopes that we can all learn together.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.000]   If your experience with money and marriage is not what I described there in my little
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   intro, don't worry.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.800]   I don't think it's anybody's experience in the world.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.320]   And so this topic is one of those that I think could have a bigger impact on our life than
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.800]   just about anything else.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200]   This is one of those topics that affects the day-to-day life.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.480]   Figuring out how to rebalance your 401(k), that is easy.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.520]   You sit down one time, you figure out an asset allocation plan, you punch in some order tickets
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.560]   on your mutual funds and boom, you're done.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.960]   Figuring out how much to spend on the budget category that you disagree on, that's a little
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   tougher.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.040]   And so today I've got Talit and Ty from His and Hers Money on to talk with me.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.480]   I reached out to them and I was able to connect with them at FinCon 2015 up in Charlotte,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.120]   North Carolina in September 2015.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.760]   So that's when this interview was recorded.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.240]   I hadn't gotten around to playing it for you guys for a while, but I'm thrilled to bring
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   it to you.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.600]   It's a good interview and I think you're going to enjoy it.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.320]   Talit and Ty have a cool story and they run a website called His and Hers Money.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.600]   So they talk about this stuff each and every day and we had an enjoyable conversation together
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.680]   and I think they're going to find a lot of value in it.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.120]   Before I play the interview for you, we're going to do sponsors up front.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.680]   There are two major things that might help you guys to get on the same page with money.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.360]   And that's why I've chosen these two sponsors to play on today's show for you.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.920]   And here are the two things.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.480]   Number one, get clear on big picture goals.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.380]   And number two, have a system of accurate, proactive money management.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.520]   Those two things can bring a tremendous amount of peace to a relationship.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.480]   If you're clear on where you're going, big picture long term, that gives you the direction,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.080]   that gives you the general orientation.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.840]   And then if you put a plan in place that accounts for the day to day activity, you can make
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   major progress.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   There's my tip.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.640]   If you need to turn off after that, that's all you need.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.320]   Well, suggestions on ways to do it.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.980]   Number one, sponsor of the day number one is Paladin, a financial advisor registry service.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.420]   Sit down with a good financial advisor and spend some time talking about your long term
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.900]   goals and figure out where you are with regard to your progress on those goals.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.740]   The best way that I know of for you to sit down and find and start your search for good
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.780]   financial advisors is to use the Paladin registry.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.500]   Paladin is a service that goes out and they bring advisors together.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.140]   They research those advisors.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.680]   Make sure they're not crooks and scoundrels.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.960]   They try to weed out the bad ones and only represent the good ones.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.280]   And what you can do is go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N, Paladin.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.360]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.280]   Put your info in there and they will refer you to a couple of financial advisors.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.360]   Start your search there.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.640]   You don't have to hire them.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.800]   I don't have any financial interest in whether you hire them or not, but at least start your
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.480]   search there and interview them first in hopes they can help you with that long term goals.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.000]   Sponsor number two is YNAB.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.600]   You Need a Budget, the budgeting software.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.040]   Brand new version of the software out.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.960]   I've gotten some mixed feedback on it.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.400]   A couple of people have loved it.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.480]   A couple of people hated it.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.640]   I haven't yet delved into it deeply enough to give you a review, but it is on my to-do
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.520]   list and that will be coming soon and I'll let you know what I think about it.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.080]   I am confident that Jesse and his team, they've been doing this a while and I'm confident
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.000]   that for the most part it's going to be great.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.440]   They did change a few features, so I'll update you on those features and let you know.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.800]   But you can try it for free, 30-day trial.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.440]   If you haven't done that, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/YNAB, Y-N-A-B.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.660]   It's an acronym for You Need a Budget, radicalpersonalfinance.com/YNAB.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.240]   Do those two things and I believe that your relationship together will be improved, not
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.440]   necessarily because of what you do, but because you're building communication around what
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.060]   you're doing.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.360]   That communication leads to a sharing of the heart, a sharing of vision and purpose, and
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.680]   that leads to making major progress in how you can relate to another person with regard
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   to money.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.800]   Let's hear what Talent and Ty had to say.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.440]   Talent and Ty, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   Hi.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   Hey, Josh.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   I'm so happy to be here.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   I'm a big fan of the show.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   Thank you.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   Absolutely.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.280]   So we're going to talk about his and her money, which ought to be fun because, what, is there
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.800]   any more challenging and more consistent challenge that people face with their money other than
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.880]   learning how to work with a loved one and work together?
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.400]   How did you guys get started in this money advice space?
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.560]   Well, we've been doing this for a while just in person, locally.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.400]   People are always asking us questions about finances because we had such a unique story.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.840]   I'm a natural spender.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.000]   My wife's a natural saver.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.120]   I had a bunch of debt when we got married.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.800]   She had never had any debt.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   I had a terrible credit score.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.720]   How's that for a challenging relationship to integrate?
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.040]   Yeah, because we were just polar opposites.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.600]   And so when we got together and got married, we had to learn a lot.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   We had to compromise a lot.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.200]   And a lot of the lessons that we've learned and people see the outcome and see that we've
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.440]   figured a lot of things out.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.960]   And so people would always be asking us questions and advice locally.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.320]   So we decided that maybe it'd be a good idea to take this message online because we could
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.280]   probably help more people than we are right now.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.200]   How long have you been married?
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   Almost 10 years.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   This is coming June.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   Okay.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.920]   So what was the process like in the beginning?
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   What was it like and then how did it change over time?
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   Yes.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.800]   So it started just with a lot of tears and Kleenex and yelling and arguing.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.760]   But no, seriously, it just was a lot of trial and error.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.200]   So again, we're completely different.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.480]   And so we had to try things a certain way.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.880]   If it worked, we kept it.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.400]   If it didn't work, we figured it out and we remixed it and tried something different.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.720]   The problem I think a lot of times when it comes to couples is that they try something
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.540]   and it didn't work and then they just drift apart.
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.800]   They become isolated.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.720]   They don't try to work through or try to find a different alternative.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.320]   And that's why finances is one of the number one reasons that marriages fall apart because
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.440]   they didn't figure out a way to work it out.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.800]   So you came together with a big disparity in both habits, but also in your financial
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   situation.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   Completely.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.960]   Did you integrate your finances together?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   Yes.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.040]   So I must mention prior to us getting married, everything pretty much hit the fan.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.280]   My husband, as he said, he was the one with debt.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280]   I had no debt.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.600]   Bad credit, great credit.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.440]   And so I thought that I was entering into marriage where my husband didn't have at least
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.040]   $30,000 worth of debt.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.120]   When we finally discovered the debt, as he said, it was a lot of trial and error, a lot
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.400]   of communication.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   I was afraid.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   I'm not going to lie.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   I was absolutely afraid because I was not used to that.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.640]   So when we got married, I knew that his debt was going to then become my debt because yes,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.920]   we did integrate our finances and we came up with a plan to get out of debt as quickly
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   as possible.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.280]   From day one, we decided that it wasn't going to be any separation.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.160]   Even though we were different, we were both willing to put in the work.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.320]   And so from day one, we integrated everything.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.760]   I mean, Ty took a big risk because of the mistakes that I was making.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.040]   But I think that she saw that my behavior was different.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.240]   Although I still had repercussions from the past mistakes that I made.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.160]   So the debt was still there, but I was thinking differently and I was behaving differently.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.880]   And so that made her realize that, you know, let's do this together.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.440]   Let's work this out as a team because that's what marriage is.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.040]   So you talk about couples money and I'm getting the sense that would your advice be to all
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.760]   couples that they should integrate their finances together?
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.440]   That is our, that's our position.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.520]   That's our standpoint.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.440]   We know that not everybody agrees with us, but anytime anybody asks us, yes, we believe
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   that when the two come together, they are one and that includes their finances.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.280]   And why, why would you marry somebody that you don't believe in that you can operate
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.680]   and get through the good and the bad together?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.960]   Because that's marriage is one long process of both of you all becoming better.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.280]   And so everything's not going to be set up perfectly from day one.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.120]   It won't be set up perfectly from day 1000.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.800]   But the point is it's a gradual process and if you don't start off thinking operating
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.080]   as a team, it's going to be much harder to do it later.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.160]   You know, and there are also exceptions to the rule.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.880]   Of course, you know, we're not saying someone who may have a spouse that has a gambling
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.240]   addiction problem or they may be in an abusive relationship.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.200]   Of course you, you should have some type of money that's separate, you know, if, because
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.400]   you have to plan for the future.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.640]   You know, I actually had a client that I dealt with.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.440]   She had to physically set money aside that her spouse did not know about because he gambled
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.400]   all of their retirement away.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.320]   So in that case, yes, you know, but the average everyday couple, you know, who's not going
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.960]   through those type of issues or situations we do believe in combining.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.400]   So when you were in those difficult early years, what were some of the things that you
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.000]   started to do that started to make a difference?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.520]   I think, I think the first, before we say what made a difference, we made a huge mistake
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.280]   right out the gate and learning from that mistake, the lessons that came out of that
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.400]   huge mistake is what propelled us forward.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.340]   So on the surface, it sounded, what we did sounded like a good idea.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.040]   So like we said, I was terrible with money.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   Ty was great with money.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   She had a finance degree.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.360]   She was working in the finance industry.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.040]   And so our idea was, okay, Ty, you handle the money.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.320]   You just let me know how things go, right, and what I should do.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.440]   And so on the surface, it sounded like a good idea, but the problem was we weren't operating
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.000]   as a team.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.240]   People make the mistake when they hear the word team, especially in marriage, they think
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.960]   that things should be 50/50, which they hardly ever are.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.360]   But another mistake people make is that when you're attempting to operate as a team, they'll
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.400]   do something a hundred to zero.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.480]   So that's what we were.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   She was doing a hundred percent of the budgeting and organizing the finance and I was doing
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   zero.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.320]   I was doing the red line saying, okay, so what do I have to operate with?
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.140]   And so what happened was over time, we begin to build up, both of us, resentment within
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.500]   each other because of this situation that we agreed to at first, but we were finding
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.880]   that we were resenting the process because she was feeling unappreciated because she
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.680]   was doing all this hard work.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.560]   She was calculating, organizing, budgeting, making sure that we weren't going into the
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.360]   red and me, I was building up resentment because I felt I knew how much I made.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.040]   I knew what my salary was and then I knew what she was saying.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.240]   Well, this is what you have to spend for the month.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.560]   And I'm like, wait a minute, this does not add up.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.720]   And so I was feeling like I was a child being handed an allowance and we weren't communicating
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.080]   our resentment.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:41.120]   And so it continued to grow and fester and we just had to sit down and discuss the resentment
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   that was in it.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   It took a while to get there.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.280]   We were just silent, quiet, and we were growing frustrated internally.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.480]   And so once we laid all the cards out on the table, like, I don't like this set up because
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.600]   of this and I don't like this set up because of this, we were able to realize we weren't
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.400]   operating as a team.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.200]   We were operating as Ty was doing all the work and I was just sitting back.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.640]   And so that's just not the way to operate.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.600]   What was your perspective, Ty?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.920]   Same, totally agree.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.640]   I thought he was a big baby, you know, and I thought that he did not appreciate what
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   I was doing.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.760]   I was making a lot of sacrifices and I did not quite feel that he was doing the same.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.280]   I felt like he wasn't making sacrifices.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.680]   I'm like, okay, if we want to reach our certain goals that we both say, then we're going to
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.560]   have to spend XYZ.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.040]   And he wanted to spend ABC.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.020]   You know, and yeah, it was very frustrating.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.080]   And so what we learned was that teamwork means that both parties have a part to play.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.040]   It may not be 50/50, but it's not 100 to zero either.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.660]   So we always give the illustration of, we're from Chicago.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.400]   So in the nineties, we were all about the Chicago Bulls and everybody knows Michael
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.520]   Jordan, but they don't know the starting point guard.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.920]   So it was BJ Armstrong for those first few.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.120]   And I say the name BJ Armstrong and nobody knows who in the world I'm talking about,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.640]   but he was the opposite guard to Michael Jordan on some of those championship teams.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.440]   And what happened was they were on the same team, right?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.320]   They didn't have the same amount of responsibility, but they both had responsibilities on the
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   team.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   So when teams were game planning to play the Chicago Bulls, it's not like they were game
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.920]   planning 50% Jordan and 50% BJ Armstrong.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.080]   No, it was overwhelmingly game planning for Michael Jordan, but BJ Armstrong played his
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.140]   part, right?
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.560]   He was the point guard on the team.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.440]   And so he had a role as a point guard.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.000]   Mike had a role as the two guard.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.840]   And because they both played their roles and they both played their roles well, they became
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   champions.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.040]   And so you both parties, husband and wife have to be involved in the game.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.920]   Even if it's 80-20, 70-30, you have to play to your strengths and you both have to play.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.140]   Did you get advice or did you figure it out the hard way?
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.940]   We started to do a lot of research on our own.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.520]   We would email each other financial articles.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.840]   We would go to sites and read their posts.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.120]   We would read books.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.240]   We started to gain the knowledge on our own in order to win it.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.120]   Yeah, we started to self-educate and do it together.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.360]   So I would come across an article or we would watch the Dave Ramsey show, the Orman show
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.640]   and discuss what was being talked about on there.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.880]   And they, what do you think about that?
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   What do you think about that?
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.000]   So at the same time, we're both growing together.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.920]   Practically, how do you actually go about on a practical basis starting to work together?
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.360]   Do both people, do you have budget meetings?
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.120]   Do you, you know, both people have a checkbook register?
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   How does it work?
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.720]   Well, now almost 10 years later in our marriage, I am still the one physically putting the
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   budget together.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.840]   However, we sit down together and we come up with the numbers, you know, so I'm the
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.720]   one with the checkbook, you know, writing the check, paying the bills because he still
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.480]   works outside of the home right now.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.640]   So it makes sense for me to do it.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.400]   But he's involved in every purchase decision.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.320]   He's involved in every line category in our budget.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.320]   Yeah, so she'll set it up and then we'll both sit down.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.320]   We'll both look at it.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.320]   We'll both talk about it.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.360]   We'll both discuss it and we'll both come up with the final game plan for the month.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   So we sit down before the month begins and do our budget.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.680]   And periodically sometimes things have come up where we didn't necessarily budget for
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.080]   it, we missed or we forgot.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.440]   So we sit down together again and say, okay, what do we need to move around and how should
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.760]   we attack this?
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.320]   And we talk about goals as far as saving up for bigger purchases.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.840]   We're always in discussion.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.600]   But again, it's not 50/50.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.200]   We both play to our strengths though.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Right.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   So what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   What's your go-to budget?
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:17:19.680]   And then what's your go-to budget?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:26.640]   What advice do you have for couples who have very different incomes?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.920]   One is much higher than the other.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   Have you worked with that?
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   With your site?
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.280]   Do you have any insight that could be helpful for those people?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   Absolutely.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   We lived it.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.880]   Well, in the beginning of our marriage, I was the one making a higher salary than my
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.840]   husband, but I never put him down.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.920]   It was our money.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.680]   You know, I never said, "Well, I'm making this.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   You're making that."
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.840]   So, I never felt like I had more power, you know, because from day one, we were one in
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.840]   our salary, right?
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.520]   And I would say that things can change because guess what?
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.480]   Ty decided she wanted to come home, and now I'm the one with the salary.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.480]   Right.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.760]   So, now imagine if in the beginning of our marriage, my wife was making me feel bad because
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.740]   she earned more than I did.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.240]   How would I be treating her right now?
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.440]   I'd be treating her the same way.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.320]   And because my wife didn't do that, because it was about us from the beginning, it's still
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.480]   about us now.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.440]   So, our advice to couples is that come together.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.800]   Realize again that you all are a team.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.180]   Who cares who makes what?
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.800]   Not I make this and you make that.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.600]   We make this amount.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   How are we going to game plan for this amount?
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.300]   What are our dreams?
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.440]   What are our goals?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.680]   What are our ambitions?
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.160]   What do we want to do with our life?
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.520]   It's always got to be about us, we, and our.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.600]   Never about you and I.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:58.640]   I personally think that this idea of thinking together versus thinking separately is a major
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.040]   influence to the breakdown of families in our culture.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.680]   The family-oriented culture of the past seems to be continually under attack, seems to be
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.840]   continually falling apart.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.640]   And in my mind, one of the most important reasons to connect money is because it's a
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.800]   symbol of connecting life.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.200]   The traditional marriage vows say, you know, we're together for life, for better or for
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.840]   worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:35.000]   And in my mind, money is the easy one to put together because that's what can happen right
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.640]   at the beginning.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.800]   And it's hard for me to see how, now I know there are exceptions, it's hard for me to
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:48.560]   see how, if your relationship isn't together on money, which is a reflection of your goals,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.520]   then how is it going to be together on how you spend your time?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.920]   And how is it going to be together, you know, when I'm 93 years old and I need a bedpan
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:03.360]   and a diaper and I'm sick and my wife is caring for me or vice versa.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.280]   If the relationship starts and it's about me and we're together out of convenience,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.840]   I don't see how it continues through the difficult times of sickness and in health.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.400]   Do you have any insight or perspective on that from your experience?
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.880]   Yeah, you got to ask yourself, is your marriage a covenant or is it a contract?
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:25.040]   Too many marriages are operating right now as business partnerships instead of covenantal
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.080]   partners.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.120]   A covenant is a union.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.380]   There is no separation in any aspect of it.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.880]   If you're in a covenant, everything you do is about the whole.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:42.560]   Whereas business partners, business contracts, leave, have out clauses, have exit strategies,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.160]   have isolation built within them.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.680]   And too many people, like you said, are operating under marriage contracts instead of marriage
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   covenants.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.760]   And we need to be striving to that covenantal relationship that, like you just talked about,
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.120]   for better than for worse, because guess what?
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.400]   You're going to experience both.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.820]   And if you don't have covenant, those worst moments can tear you apart.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.760]   But if you do have covenant, those worst moments can drive you closer together.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.520]   It's my experience.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.640]   My wife and I have been married for a little over three and a half years now, something
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   like that.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:24.960]   And just in my experience, marriage is tough.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.160]   And that's why it's very much driven by a philosophical and ethical and moral framework,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.360]   which is something that we debate about on an ongoing basis in our society.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.280]   But at least our experience has been that marriage is so challenging that without the
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.520]   framework of commitment and no exit point, it's not possible for it to continue.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.660]   My wife and I, we didn't come from a perspective of being deeply in debt.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.040]   We didn't come from the perspective of a dramatic difference.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.960]   But even for us, actually, even though I talk about money and whatnot, we did have a major
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:06.080]   challenge in that prior to our marriage, I had made some stupid business decisions and
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.920]   basically hadn't watched my expenses of my business carefully enough.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.440]   I'd hired a bunch of staff and spent all my money.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.760]   And so by the time I got through with that expensive phase of my business, where I'd
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.720]   let my business expenses grow too high without the corresponding revenue, and then by the
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.480]   time I'd gotten through my personal experiences, and then by the time I had worked through
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.760]   just even the expenses of marriage, engagement ring, weddings, things like that, honeymoons,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.360]   etc., I came to a perspective where coming into marriage, I didn't have a big, cushy
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.920]   savings account, which is really hard because I always imagined myself that I was going
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.120]   to be the rich guy coming into marriage.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.840]   I'm going to come in with hundreds of thousands of dollars of savings.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.120]   And it was really humbling, really, really humbling to be Josh Rasheed's Mr. Financial
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120]   Advisor.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.640]   And I married my wife, who never made a lot of money, but she was always so careful and
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.680]   so frugal that she had a lot of money saved, and I had spent all of mine investing in my
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.160]   business.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:08.560]   And it's tough because it created in our relationship, it created challenges that for years we continued
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.840]   to work at.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:17.180]   And I can't see how if our relationship were built upon love, if our relationship were
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.520]   built upon good feelings for each other, if our relationship were built upon any of those
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.040]   things, I can't see how it would survive.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.720]   For us, it wasn't built on that.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   It was built upon a commitment.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.300]   You can use the word covenant.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.800]   It was built upon, you know, I was told, I said, "Honey, if you ever leave me, I'm going
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.400]   with you, so don't even bother trying."
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.680]   And so then on that basis, then everything else flows and the love comes out of that,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.320]   the good feelings come out of that, and the ability to work through things comes out of
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.800]   that because you've got no other choice.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.960]   And so I always struggle with giving financial advice to couples because people come at their
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.560]   relationships from such a dramatically different perspective.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.480]   It's always a real challenge for me to figure out, well, do I just share my perspective
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.760]   and tell you how I view the world?
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.960]   Do I try to look at the world through your lens?
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.680]   Money exposes the strengths or flaws of every relationship.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.840]   But that's the point of marriage.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.600]   It's to make you better.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.720]   And so it would have been pointless for you to marry somebody just like you because you
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   would have never got better.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.920]   You would have got worse.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.080]   And so what happens is we're married to people who are our opposites because they're going
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.160]   to make you better and you're going to make them better.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.120]   And what has to happen, no matter what the two backgrounds are, is you got to go through
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.880]   the process of making each other better.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.840]   You got to have those discussions.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   We started with that.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.960]   You guys didn't start with any debt, but there were still conversations that needed to be
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.960]   had.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.480]   The lines of communication needed to be open.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.040]   You needed to dream together.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.120]   You need to make a plan together how you're going to move forward.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.640]   Now the wedding day is gone.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   Honeymoon's over.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   Okay, here's day one.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.920]   What is our life going to look like?
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.820]   So it doesn't matter where you start.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.680]   What matters is that you both put in the work and that you're willing to come together with
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.280]   your differences, with your flaws and make each other better.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.480]   I would disagree with you on one thing.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.040]   It doesn't start on day one because day one, you're still fine.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   You're still right.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   Right.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   Right.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.440]   I remember when I was like 37, right before the first year where all of a sudden you start
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.960]   to say, Oh, okay.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.840]   So the reality of life is that I'm living with somebody.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   They have idiosyncrasies.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.440]   I got to learn to deal with.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.760]   Yeah, you're right about that.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   So practically, let me ask you, one spouse is listening to this and I don't know whether
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:43.440]   it's husband or wife, but one spouse is listening to this and they're thinking, my relationship
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.720]   is just struggling and they want to start.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   What's the first step?
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.440]   What do they go home and do?
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.160]   Have a conversation with your spouse, I would say.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.560]   For us, it was prayer first.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560]   I had to go to God.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   We are Christians.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.440]   And so I had to go to God to pray about my husband first before I actually started to
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.840]   communicate with him and have the talk and discussion.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.120]   And just be honest, be transparent.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.600]   Don't be judgmental.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.520]   When you go to your spouse, don't point the finger at them and find out or point out their
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.960]   failures or their flaws.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:27.600]   I would first start the conversation just by saying, I know that I have not been 100%
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.720]   with whatever it is.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.240]   And then just ask for them just to listen and then wait for a response.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.640]   Along those lines, while you're trying to get to that point, even maybe leading up to
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.200]   that conversation, maybe you can't do it right here today wouldn't be a good time for you
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.880]   to talk to them.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.400]   Also ask and look and self-evaluate.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   What are some ways that I can get better?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.080]   What are some areas that I need to grow in?
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.960]   Because what happens is if you can get two spouses that are both working on themselves,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.360]   the marriage as a whole gets better.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.760]   And so as you're working on yourself, you'll probably come to realize how you can approach
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.080]   your spouse better or what are some things that you can do to be the example.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.400]   Maybe you're going to have to be the change that you want to see first.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.840]   And that change could lead to a conversation like, well, why are you doing that?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   What's the point?
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   Where are you trying to get to?
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.480]   And boom, there's an opportunity for an initial conversation just to get the ball rolling.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.820]   Don't expect an overnight fix because that's not, again, that's not what marriage is.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.440]   Marriage is a process.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.360]   And so what trials and tribulations do is it builds character, it builds perseverance.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.240]   And so it comes again to make you better and embrace the process because again, it's a
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.360]   process.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.040]   Don't just have one conversation like, oh, he didn't change.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   She didn't change.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.280]   I give up.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.320]   That's not marriage.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   It's a process.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.680]   And so it's going to take a lifetime of conversations.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.240]   Ty and I still have conversations.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.360]   We still don't see eye to eye on some things just because we're naturally wired financially
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   different.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.240]   It still takes conversations and it still takes compromise 10 years later.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.120]   It's all, that's what marriage is, one big compromise.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.660]   And so you're going to have to be willing to be patient and talk things through consistently
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.400]   and on a regular basis.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:23.000]   I would add to that also, in addition to those things in the short term, having a united
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.440]   vision and spending the time to understand how to build a vision that includes all of
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.600]   the things that are important to each party.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.560]   It does my relationship with my wife no good if I just say, well, this is what I want to
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.840]   do and I'm going to go for it.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.440]   It also does no good if I just say, well, honey, what do you want to do?
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.280]   Okay, let's just go for that.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.480]   This concept of the wishy-washy husband, honey, yes.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.280]   I'll tell you one joke I can't stand is when people make the joke about, well, yes, dear,
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:00.120]   being the appropriate response in all situations and all circumstances for a husband.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.700]   It's nonsense.
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.960]   It's not yes, dear.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.760]   It's let's understand together what's important.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.920]   And my job is to make sure that our vision as a family is the appropriate vision that
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.280]   satisfies the needs and desires of everyone in it.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.360]   And then building that long-term united vision and then orienting the money in line with
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:27.640]   that and making sure that the needs of each spouse are cared for and are united in that.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   And so, you know, it's, I've had in my relationship with my wife, we've worked hard at this in
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.920]   the sense that I think a lot about vision.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.160]   I think a lot about long-term.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.760]   I'm obsessed with here are the goals.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   Here's the next step.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   Here's the plan.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760]   Here's where we're going to go.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   Here are these types of things.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   My wife is very different.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.980]   She's not, she's not that obsessive, you know, vision thing.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.360]   She's much more in the present.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.840]   She's not foolish.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.960]   She's just much more in the present.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.800]   And she thinks less about, well, these are all the directions I need to go.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.760]   But I know it makes a world of difference when I spend a lot of time asking and trying
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.200]   to encourage her, hey, write these, write down, share with me, write a journal entry.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   Here's a journaling exercise.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.000]   Now give that to me so that I can understand and so then we can talk together and I can
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.080]   make sure that we're not just charging off after Joshua's great crazy ideas without making
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.160]   sure that as a family we're accounting for the needs of our family.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.200]   She goes back to the concept of teamwork.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.920]   We both have a part to play.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.760]   And again, it shows the benefits of you all being totally different because she needs
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.240]   you for vision and for goal setting and you need her for the details of today.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.520]   She's the one that says, Joshua, that doesn't make sense.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.880]   We can't do that right now.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.980]   My wife is the same way.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.600]   My wife is the exact same way.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:54.520]   When I have these big lofty ideas and I say let's do this or that, she's quick to tell
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.280]   me if this is a reality.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.040]   Maybe not today, maybe next week, maybe a month from now.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.000]   But we both have a part to play.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.600]   And as long as we're both playing to our strengths and we're both willing to hear and work with
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.560]   each other, we're both going to win.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.560]   So tell it, you are earning an income now and Ty, you're at home not earning an income.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.720]   Do you make special provision for that in your budget somehow or plan for that?
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:24.400]   Because in many relationships, especially Ty, with your being at home, many parents,
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.600]   especially for their daughters, would say don't ever let yourself be in a position of
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.400]   where you don't have resources.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.440]   Don't ever let yourself be in a position where you've got to depend on your husband for income
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.920]   because you're basically setting yourself up to get cheated on and abandoned and then
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   you're destroyed.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.040]   Do you have any perspective on how you guys account for that fear in your marriage?
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.880]   Well, prior to us getting married, that's all I used to hear.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.480]   People would tell me, "Oh girl, make sure you have your stuff on the side because you
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.000]   just never know."
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.360]   But as Tyler said, we went into marriage as a covenant, not as a business contract.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.680]   So I didn't go into marriage with an exit plan.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.520]   So I don't want to go throughout our marriage with an exit plan.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:15.080]   Now I'm not going to be foolish if I saw that my husband was doing some things that I did
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:22.080]   not agree with and it was red sirens going off, then yes, then I would definitely be
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.680]   put some type of money aside.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.760]   But no, that's not how I approach it.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.880]   So I wouldn't advise someone else to do the same.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   That's the way we do it.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   We do it different.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.320]   We just don't think about what if our marriage doesn't work.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.040]   I think that that just are bad seeds to plant.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:47.800]   And so it's just really all about us trying to get better.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.760]   We don't make provisions for disaster.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   We just don't.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.920]   We make provisions for our future with the intent of having a lifetime together.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.800]   And those are the type of seeds that we plant even in our finances.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.360]   Again, we don't operate as if I have an income and she doesn't.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.440]   We operate as if this is our income.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.600]   So from day one, one of the reasons that we've been able to make this transition for her
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.360]   to come home is we never lived on both incomes when we had two incomes.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.400]   We built a life that was based on one income from the beginning.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.600]   And so we used one income for our investments or entrepreneurial endeavors.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.640]   And so we were used to living on one income.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.160]   And so when her mindset changed and she felt like she wanted to come home, we began to
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   have children and she wanted to be at home with the kids.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:44.480]   It wasn't a huge paradigm shift because we were kind of used to it anyway.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.520]   We still had to tighten things up a bit to make room so that that one income can also
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.240]   include saving and investing money.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   But it was because of the mindset that we have, our team, us, it wasn't a hard transition.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.180]   You don't think it's a little bit of a naive approach?
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.840]   Not for us because again, as Ty mentioned, our roots are biblical.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.580]   And so when we decided that we were going to get married, we decided that we were going
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.200]   to be married forever.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.520]   And so again, it's hard work.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.160]   There have been low points.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.400]   There have been tough times.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.780]   We've been through it.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:29.080]   We know what it feels like to want to separate, to want to let things fall apart.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.160]   But our foundation tells us we need to work through it.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.040]   So maybe it is naive, but it's also biblical.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.540]   That's really all that matters to us.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:46.120]   One thing that we do in my family, and I want to mention it as just a practical tip for
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.560]   anybody who's listening to this show, I think it's important.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:35:00.280]   In my family, I earn the income for our household and I'm also the person who coordinates the
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.880]   bills and the check register and things like that.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:09.720]   And I'm also the spender in the family compared to my wife, who is the saver.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.320]   I'm much more easily influenced by, "Man, I want to buy this new gadget."
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   I'm much more easily influenced by, "Man, this new thing over here."
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.920]   So when you start adding those things together, I earn the income.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.440]   I manage the monthly budget, manage the accounts.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.440]   I'm the spender.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:32.360]   And then you add to that the fact that I have a business and I run the business and there
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:37.040]   are expenditures that I may make in business that have a specific business function that
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.640]   I wouldn't make if I weren't able to earn money off of them.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.760]   So one of the things that I'm very aware of, and I think husbands, if they're in a situation
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.680]   like I am, need to be very aware of, that can lead to a real, I'm not sure the right
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.560]   word, imbalance of power, I would say maybe imbalance of influence.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.480]   I don't like to think about marriage relationships as a power struggle.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:09.040]   One of the things I've learned is very important that I try to do is, because of those things,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.880]   I try to make sure that I'm not a bully.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:22.080]   And I'm also not even tight with the money that my wife needs to run the household and
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.000]   the money that my wife needs even for her own personal consumption.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.080]   Now it's got to be in arrangement to, it's got to be in comparison to the income of the
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:39.520]   household, but I try to make sure that she never has to come and ask me for money.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.480]   And what I find, that's really, really beneficial because I know, number one, she is so thrifty
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.000]   and she is so frugal.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.640]   So in my mind, I want her to always have plenty of money lying around that she can do what
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.960]   she wants with so she doesn't feel like she has to come and say, "Ask Joshua, okay, Joshua,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.040]   can I have money?"
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.560]   I think when spouses do that and if you're not communicating about a vision, if you're
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.180]   not coordinating your household together, and then if one spouse is pulling all the
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.360]   strings and has control of the purse strings, it can lead to what you described in that
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.040]   beginning time of coming and, whether it's husbands or wives, groveling to your spouse
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.660]   and asking for money.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.680]   Then you have a child-parent relationship.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:26.400]   Which is not about a child-parent relationship, it's about my husband-my wife relationship.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Absolutely.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.880]   Yeah, I think it's key.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:35.800]   The underlying way to avoid that imbalance, you just said it, is communication.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:41.960]   Not only you saying, "Okay, so these are the numbers, these are the expenses, here we go."
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.100]   But it's also her saying, "Well, that's not quite enough."
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.400]   And it's not quite enough because I have to do this, I have to do that, I have to do the
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   other.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   It's a two-way process.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.240]   Communication is a two-way process.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.360]   It's not just the talking, but it's also the listening.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:04.760]   And so if you have talking and listening going on, whether you're doing all the numbers,
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.520]   still as long as you're, when you get done talking about the numbers, as long as she's
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:15.120]   talking back to you with her input, then it's still teamwork happening.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.480]   What is wrong or what people, when they get out into left field, is just that when you
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.120]   just, the mistake we made at the beginning was tied to the numbers and just handed me
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.480]   the plan and say, "Okay, here we go."
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.640]   What has to happen is there has to be two-way communication.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.960]   So again, it's not ever going to be 50/50, but you guys are playing to your strengths.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.760]   You are the number cruncher, you are the aligner.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.200]   I mean, she doesn't know what the business expenses are because she's not operating in
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   the business.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.120]   That can't be her strength because she's not involved.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   So her strength is looking at the money and you said she's thrifty, so she's able to stretch
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.040]   a dollar and make things work better.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040]   And what does that do?
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.640]   That frees up more cash for you to be able to market or do whatever you need to do with
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   the company.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.880]   So again, it's you all operating as a team.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:06.360]   Just don't, people have to not let themselves get caught up in operating or attempting to
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.240]   operate 50/50 because it's just not a reality and you're going to be frustrated, but you
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.220]   can't operate it as 100 and zero either.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.680]   You got to have some type of balance and balance 70/30, believe it or not, is balance.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.720]   80/20 is balance as long as you're both playing to your strengths and you can win as long
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.120]   as you're both doing your part and you're doing your part well.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.240]   So your website and your podcast is His and Her Money.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.360]   Do you guys stay exclusively focused on these couples discussions or do you talk about other
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.720]   areas of finance as well?
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.080]   Yeah, we talk about marriage, money, home organization.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:44.560]   We're trying to help as many married couples as possible get on good financial footing
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.000]   because again, marriage and money are two tough things to put together.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.160]   It's one of the leading causes of divorce.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.660]   So if we can get a husband and wife together on the same page financially, we know that
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:01.880]   a lot of that stress, anxiety and downfall can be avoided.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   And so that's our focus.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.080]   We have the site, the podcast, the YouTube channel, all His and Her Money, Twitter, Facebook,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   wherever you want to find us.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.840]   And we also share a lot of debt-free stories.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.040]   We believe that every marriage, well every person in general should be debt-free.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:22.120]   So we share a lot of debt-free stories on how people got out of debt in even a short
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.640]   period of time and what were some of the steps that they've taken.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.240]   Your voice alone, Talit and Ty, your voices alone, especially you Talit, makes me want
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   to listen.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   You have such a cool radio voice.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   You got that deep voice, you got kind of the real soft accent.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   Hopefully we can also get you on the show and you can share your story.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   I'd love to.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   Absolutely.

[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.200]   Now that you heard the interview, you got to do something and do something in order
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.840]   to at least start the ball rolling with your spouse.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.440]   I hope that some of the ideas and discussions that we had maybe gave you some ideas of ways
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.120]   that you can more proactively interact with your spouse.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:36.440]   I'll tell you, managing money together is not easy, but it is worth it because it allows
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:42.520]   us to be focused on the same goal together.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.480]   It makes all the difference in the world.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.520]   It allows for synergy and us to work together.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.600]   So Talent and Ty, thank you for coming on the show.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.840]   If you are interested in checking out their stuff, hisandhermoney.com.

[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.000]   Since it's been a while, I popped over to their website.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.120]   They have a brand new project, which is a community of people talking about this stuff
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.320]   called Smart Money Couples.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.760]   So if you would like to join that community and talk with some other people about this
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.400]   particular topic, go to smartmoneycouples.com.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   Just notice they launched that.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.960]   I want to help them with some publicity for that.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   Smartmoneycouples.com.

[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.240]   I talk a little bit here and there on the show about this topic, but it's not a daily
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   theme.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.680]   If you're having stress in your marital relationship as regards money, it's a daily source of
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.960]   stress for most of us.
