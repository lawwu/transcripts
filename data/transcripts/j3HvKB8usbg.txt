[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Grading on a curve in the classroom and competing in the marketplace for a job
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   against others of similar skill sets and abilities, sports team tryouts.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   In so many areas of life, we get compared and graded based on the performance of our peers.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And we benefit from their failures.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   This dynamic can feed in us a toxic pride when those failures of others will advance us.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So how do we seek the good of others when others are our rivals?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   It's a very good question today from an international high school student named Clara.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for your ministry. I'm writing because of a problem that disturbs my following of Christ.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I'm a high school student living in South Korea.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I read in scripture about the self-conceit and pride that is really sinful,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   especially looking down on others and trying to be better than someone out of pride.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   However, the high school grading system in South Korea is based on comparative evaluation,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   where I get better grades when others fail.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So how do I love my neighbor in this atmosphere of comparative evaluation,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   where I benefit from the failures of my neighbor?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Even though Clara doesn't ask my opinion about this grading system,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I'm going to make a comment about it before I answer her more important question
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   about how to love people.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   A system of student evaluation that only communicates a person's competencies in relation to other students
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   is not useful, it's not helpful in preparing a student for life in the real world.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And the reason is that such a system of evaluation doesn't communicate to the student or the parents
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   or the future employers what the student's competencies really are.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   There may be a class of 50 math students, all of which are weak in math,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   some more weak than others.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   If grades are given out only in relation to the other members of the class,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   then weak students in math, the least weak but still weak, will be given As.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   That's not a way to communicate anything clear or helpful to the student or the family or their employer
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   because it does not communicate the truth about the student's weakness in math.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   On the other hand, there may be a class of 50 students, all of which are very bright in math,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   just some a little brighter than others.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And in that system, the slightly less bright students will be given low, low grades,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   which will communicate nothing true to the student or the parents or the employer
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   because they're really very, very bright in math.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But that's my opinion about that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I just that's the way I feel about grading.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   She wants to know how to love her neighbor who is less competent than she is in a specific field
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and whose lower competence accents her superior competence.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Now, that question is a real life question because that's the situation in which all of us live all of the time.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We we will always be relating to people who are inferior to us in some skills and competencies
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and who are superior to us in other ways.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Now, how are we supposed to love people in real life?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So I just want to commend to Clara four passages of Scripture to think about on her way to humility and love.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Number one, 1 Corinthians 4, 6 and 7.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   "I have applied all these things," Paul says, "to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   For who sees anything different in you?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And if you received it, why are you boasting as though it were not a gift?"
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   In other words, if we're going to love others, we must be done with pride, self-exaltation, boasting.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And Paul says one key to that self-humbling is to realize that absolutely everything we have,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   every competency we have, every advantage we have is a free gift of God.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It is a gracious gift of God, which we do not deserve.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   If we are better in some subject than someone else, God made us better,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and his reasons for doing so are not pride and boasting and elitism.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   His reason for doing so is that we might use our competencies for the good of others.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That's the point of 1 Corinthians 12 through 14, where the differentiation of the gifts is made crystal clear
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   for the sake of the building up of the body of Christ, not exalting over other members in the body,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   but building other members up with our distinct gifting.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Number two, Jeremiah 9, 23, "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Let not the mighty man boast in his might.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practiced steadfast love,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight," declares the Lord.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   In other words, if you are wise or strong or rich, you will only be pleasing to God and useful to people
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   if you cease to boast in the wisdom and the strength and the riches,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   but instead value God more than you value your superiority in any particular competency.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   So let's fix our focus on the all-satisfying superiorities of God and not ourselves
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   or any vaunted skills we think we have that are better than others.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   They come from God, and God is infinitely superior to all of them.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Number three, Galatians 6, 2-5.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Here's a paradox in this text.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It often has baffled me what this text means, but I think I've got it now, so let me try it out.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   On the one hand, it says, "Bear one another's burdens," and on the other hand, it says, "Bear your own burdens."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Listen, this is Galatians 2-2.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   "Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   For if anyone thinks he has something when he has nothing, he deceives himself.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   for each will have to bear his own load."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Now, I think the point is this.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   If you're going to really be a person who bears the burdens of others by serving them and helping them,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   you must stop puffing yourself up by comparing yourself with them, looking for your superiorities.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   You will give an account of yourself to the Lord, just yourself.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   The Lord has given you your distinctives.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   You don't boast in the way you compare to another.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   If you boast, you boast that God made you the way you are, just for you.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   So stop comparing.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Bear your own load.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   That is, own who you are for yourself as God made you, not who you are in superiority or inferiority to other people.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Then you can be about the business of loving others, which we are to do.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Number four, finally, Philippians 2, 3-4.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   This may be the most immediately relevant text.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It's so powerful.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves."
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   There's the key phrase.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   "Count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Let each of you look not only to his own interest, but also to the interests of others."
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I used to really stumble over this text, thinking with the old King James translation, "Count others better than yourselves,"
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   that if I'm an A student in math and my sister's a C student in math, then I have to look at my sister and think, "She's a better math student than me."
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Well, that's just plain self-deception.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's not what the text means.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That's not a very helpful translation.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The newer translations are right to say, "Count others more significant than yourselves," which I think means this.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   When Clara looks on the students in her classes in high school and finds that she is making some better grades than they are,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   she is supposed to look at them as worthy of her service, because that's the context.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Jesus emptied himself, didn't count equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   He came and he served us, even though we didn't deserve it at all.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   He counted us as more significant than himself, and he got under us and put on a towel and served us.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So, Clara, the pathway to loving those who are less competent than you in one subject or another is,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   number one, gladly acknowledge that all your competencies are free gifts of God.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You don't deserve them.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Number two, delight yourself in the Lord above all your competencies and superiorities.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Number three, be done with measuring your worth by your superiority or inferiority to others.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And number four, use all of your competencies to serve other people.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Take the very things that elevate you above them and use them to go down under them and lift them up.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Amen. And these principles carry over into so many comparative scenarios in life, not just academics.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And Clara, thank you for the question, and thank you for listening and supporting this podcast.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive and send us an email of your own,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   even questions related to the comparison pressures that you face at work and at school.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Well, if our faith was stronger, would we be healthier?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Would we be more financially secure?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Would we be made more happy?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Does Jesus say that our sorrow is traced back to a lack of faith on our part?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That's the question up next when we return on Monday.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Have a great weekend. We'll see you then.
