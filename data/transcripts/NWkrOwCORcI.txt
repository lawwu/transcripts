[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.720]   and a college buddy cornered me to talk about markets. And he had just discovered zero hedge,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.440]   unfortunately for him. As one does. And was concerned about how the Fed's money printing
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.960]   is going to cause hyperinflation. And then he walked me through like a five-point plan
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.720]   of why this is happening, and why he's putting his entire portfolio into gold. And he talked
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.640]   his dad into doing the same. And honestly, some of the points at the time, it kind of
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.760]   felt like it made sense, right? That that same year, a group of well-known economists
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.880]   penned a letter to Ben Bernanke. It was an open letter, so you know it meant business.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.680]   Open letter to Ben Bernanke. And I'm not going to name any names here, but it was well-known
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.440]   economists, portfolio managers, hedge fund managers, a lot of people you'd know. Really,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.040]   really smart people. And they were begging him to stop QE, because it was going to cause
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.600]   really high inflation, maybe hyperinflation. And for someone who didn't know a lot about
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.280]   the inner workings of the Fed, because pre-2008, you didn't really have to. You know? Like,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.880]   a lot of the stuff that they did in quantitative easing, and all this stuff they were doing,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.600]   it was changed in 2008 in its aftermath. So, you know, before converting all my money into
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   gold bars and buying cans of beans and creating a shelter in the backyard, like, I figured
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.960]   I might as well learn about this stuff. And one of the most informed sources I found in
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.920]   the Fed at the time was this blog called Pragmatic Capitalism from Cullen Roche. And so, Cullen
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.520]   had actually done the work, and he looked at what the Fed was actually doing, and not
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.880]   just saying, like, they're printing money. Because obviously at the time, the Fed was
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.360]   not handing money out. I didn't get any money from the Fed. My portfolio was not going up,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.200]   because the Fed was giving me money. And it's like, people say the Fed is printing money,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.640]   but where is it actually going? So, you had to kind of understand it. And Cullen kind
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   of schooled me what was really happening, explained why hyperinflation was kind of a
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.440]   ridiculous concept to think about at the time, and why even high inflation after that was
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280]   probably not going to happen, which turned out to be right. And so, after the latest
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.000]   crisis, like, we have elevated inflation now, so what's next? So, I wanted to get Cullen's
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.440]   perspective. So, today's show is going to be a little different. I put a bunch of questions
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.440]   together, because I'm kind of confused as to what the Fed is doing, and how this is
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.760]   going to all transpire, and what's going on. So, I wanted to hear Cullen. So, let's bring
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.020]   him out, John, just to talk about this current crisis. Cullen, how's it going, man? When
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.320]   did you start your blog? 2008-ish? Yeah, well, it was late 2008. Yeah, and it,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.800]   God, it got really big really fast, because I was kind of, it was funny. I was actually
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.280]   writing in 2008-2009, I was actually writing content that was a lot like zero, I'd say
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   zero hedge now, because everyone's been calling me that this year. But no, it was a lot like
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.640]   zero hedge, where it was kind of talking about all the sort of perma bear stuff that was,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.200]   you know, unavoidable back then. But it was in that period that I really started to, especially
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.000]   in 2009-ish, really when things were starting to get really hairy with, especially with
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.920]   a lot of the central bank operations, and I was trying to navigate, you know, is this
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.840]   going to cause hyperinflation? That was the point where I was really delving deep into
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.560]   the operational side of everything, and really looking at it more from like the perspective
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.680]   of like an accountant, where I was trying to, you know, understand the flows of the
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.960]   balance sheets and the income statements, so that you can try to actually navigate.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   And that was the first thing that you said that made sense to me, like, you're talking
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.240]   about like, it's assets and liabilities, and they kind of cancel each other out, and that
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.880]   was the first thing that you said that made sense to me, like, oh, that's right, it's
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   not like the Fed is flooding the system with money, this is more of like a banking transaction
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.520]   kind of thing.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.560]   Yeah, well, you start to, when you actually go through the flow of funds, you realize
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.980]   that almost everything that's done with quantitative easing is after the fact of fiscal policy.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.040]   So there has to be treasury bonds that were issued in the first place in order for the
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.160]   Fed to even buy the treasury bonds.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.440]   So, you know, the way to think of it is like, if you were to consolidate the Fed into the
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.520]   treasury, well, in that case, you know, what QE really does is QE is basically issuance
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.080]   of a deficit in cash form.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.560]   It just takes you to that ultimate form of the government actually does print the money.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.120]   But what QE is, QE is weird, because if the treasury bonds were already printed, and you
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.040]   could say that a deficit is basically government spending that results in a deficit is technically
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.520]   treasury bond printing.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720]   Like I think that's a fine term to use as far as deficit spending goes.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.560]   But all QE does is then take that bond and swap it with a reserve in the private sector.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.920]   And so it's the exact same thing as if the government, the treasury had in the first
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.480]   instance just printed the reserves into existence.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.640]   And so to me, when you look at what QE does, you're like, well, wait a minute, this is
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.520]   just it's really just an asset swap.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.840]   And maybe this has all sorts of like tangential impacts.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.880]   You can debate whether that makes people go out and need to replace their cash with high
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   yield bonds.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.200]   And there's a risk component there, for sure.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.480]   It's not technically money printing in the sense that like, you know, taking wheelbarrows
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.160]   of cash out of the treasury would be in dumping them on the street, you know.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.960]   And now we're looking at the other thing where it's QT, which is quantitative tightening.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.720]   So I put together some questions here.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.800]   These questions may be a little leading because I've shared some thoughts on the Fed, but
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.280]   I wanted to hear your perspective on this.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.520]   So Duncan, let's do the first one.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.040]   These are all questions for me, because I have a lot of questions about the Fed, too.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   Let's do it.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.960]   I like they're all short and sweet, you know, and not a single not to brag in here.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.720]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   We love those.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   All right.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.440]   Up first, is the Fed making a huge mistake by potentially throwing us into a recession?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.120]   This is a question everyone has now.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.200]   So listen, Cullen, obviously the Fed had to do something.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.580]   Like, you can't just let inflation be at 8% or 9%, and it seems like the government
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.520]   is not really doing anything, even though they are the ones who spend a bunch of money.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.640]   So I guess my biggest surprise is not that the Fed is raising rates, but it's the speed
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.120]   at which they're doing it and the fact that they seem to be willing to throw us into a
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.320]   recession to get there.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.280]   So do you think that there is a mistake here in terms of the magnitude of this move and
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.880]   the fact that maybe they're trying to make up for mistakes they made in the past by not
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.600]   finding that, you know, it's not seeing that inflationary spike in the first place?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.880]   And I, you know, I think being in the financial markets, that's the thing.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.980]   That's the difference in the way we perceive things versus the way the Fed does.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.660]   I mean, we're inherently focused on risk management to a large degree.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.180]   And so to me, you know, the pace of these rate hikes, it's the fastest rate hikes basically
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.180]   ever.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.460]   The market is already pricing in four, four and a half percent overnight rates.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.380]   So we've come basically off of zero to four and a half, which, you know, from the basis
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.780]   of zero, that's a huge, huge historical move, much bigger than anything that's ever happened
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.780]   before.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.060]   And so the portfolio shock and the economic shock is really only just filtering through
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.060]   the system.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.860]   Because, I mean, it was just a year ago, literally a year ago, that Powell was talking about
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.460]   the markets and saying, we don't need to raise rates yet because the unemployment rate is
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.460]   still too high.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.540]   That was only a year ago.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.560]   So they hadn't even really started to move as of 12 months ago.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.780]   And so they're really, they're playing, you know, catch up here in a big way.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.620]   The worry now, this feels a lot like sort of the opposite environment where, you know,
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.500]   the big thing that I look at is not only the foreign exchange markets where you see the
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.140]   dollar going crazy, which is almost always a sign of bad stuff going on in foreign markets.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:12.300]   But if you look domestically, the mortgage rates in the United States, you know, have
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.540]   surged so much that at some point you have to look at this and say, OK, housing is the
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.660]   biggest sector of the U.S. economy.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.460]   If you if you bring housing to a complete freeze, what happens to the U.S. economy?
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.420]   And we know from 2008, 2009, if you cause a big problem in housing, you could cause
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.500]   a big problem in the aggregate economy.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.780]   So that is the risk that I'm growing increasingly concerned about.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.620]   And you look at all this housing data, all the housing data is starting to look like
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.900]   a disaster.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.420]   And I don't see how with mortgage rates at 7 percent for, you know, the next 12 months,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.700]   how does that not just continue for all the 24 months?
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.980]   I got I got a question come up on housing.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.980]   I just want to ask.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.220]   So I've looked at this before.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.740]   Every time inflation has spiked above 5 percent in the past, the only way it's come down is
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.740]   is through a recession, basically.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.020]   Do you think that the Fed has just resigned to this?
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.140]   Like, it seems like they almost don't even want to look for another path.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.260]   Like, is there a way that we could get inflation come down and be a little more patient and
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.740]   bring it down without a recession?
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.500]   Is that pretty much the only tool they have?
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.140]   I mean, a lot of this is in my view, it's sort of the way a boom bust cycle works, like
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.140]   you could look back at 2021 and say, well, the market just it went up too much.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.700]   Like people were were at home, bored, doing stupid stuff, buying more stuff than they
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.500]   should have, you know, buying GameStop and AMC and all these silly things that, you know,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.380]   were kind of going on last year.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.460]   And so you had this big sort of irrational boom.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.500]   And I think it's it's perfectly rational to argue now that there needed to be some give
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   back.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.940]   So there needed to be a bust to some degree.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.380]   And, you know, whether that results in like a technical recession or not, you know, it's
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.980]   just that's just the way.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.020]   And my thinking is in the economy sometimes evolves.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.860]   The worry with me now is that I basically think that you were going to get this bust
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.860]   no matter what.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.860]   Right.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.300]   Because that's just the way that the cycle was going to occur.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.940]   You know, you had so many unusual variables from covid that these variables were eventually
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.180]   going to work themselves out.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.260]   It was just it's really just a matter of time.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.300]   I mean, the you know, the Fed was was wrong to call this transitory.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.100]   But in the long run, the likelihood that this ends up being transitory is probably very,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.220]   very close to right.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:25.020]   So the worry now is that the car is slowing and you start to see this already in a lot
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.900]   of the data and the Fed is coming in and they're basically slamming the brakes on.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   And so now you worry, well, are they causing the car to slow to a speed that's unnecessarily
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.700]   slow or are they potentially going to cause the car to crash at this point?
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.820]   Because they're they're now being trying to be proactive about something that was already
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.820]   well in motion.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.820]   Right.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.420]   To your point, like, I think everything spikes so much.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.680]   It's like a retail sales charts.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.820]   All these things are off the charts.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.180]   Even a normalization probably would have felt or looked like a slowdown.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.180]   So, yeah.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.180]   With or without them.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.380]   So let's I wanted to kind of talk about like the unintended consequences.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.900]   Duncan, throw up the next question.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.900]   All right.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.540]   You're already kind of segwaying nicely into this.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.540]   But yeah.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.820]   What are some of the unintended consequences of the Fed raising rates so aggressively?
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.620]   So you mentioned the dollar here.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.740]   I think that's the biggest one right now where sometimes the Fed can't help like what their
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.180]   actions have in the rest of the world.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.500]   But should they care if the dollar strengthening is going to mess up a bunch of emerging markets
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.980]   and even some developed markets like the UK, where the strength of the dollar is potentially
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.860]   creating crises elsewhere in the world and eventually that comes to our shore and then
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.860]   they're forced to fix.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.440]   So like, should they care about that stuff?
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.780]   They end up being forced to care at some point, because if things get bad enough abroad, the
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.740]   especially with the European banking system, it's so intertwined into the U.S. banking
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:50.340]   system that, you know, let's say that let's play sort of like worst case scenario here
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.300]   and say that Europe gets really messy in the next two years.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.340]   And let's say that Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and a lot of the big European banks are
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.980]   legitimately in big, big trouble.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.100]   Well, one of the central banks that has to get involved in all of that is the Fed, because
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.980]   the Fed is so intertwined in the European banking system through like the, you know,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.100]   the euro dollar market, basically euro or dollar denominated borrowing markets that
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.300]   are based in Europe.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.940]   The Fed ends up being forced to get involved through, you know, Fed swap lines or lending
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.140]   facilities to these entities.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.700]   So to me, it's kind of unavoidable.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.820]   And that's the, you know, it's technically like a Triffin dilemma, basically, where the
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:39.100]   Fed is they're the reserve currency issuer in the world.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.420]   And the U.S. economy is so big and so intertwined into everything else that there's a lot of
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.060]   there's a lot of markets that rely on the dollar to function, a lot of foreign economies
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.420]   that rely on the dollar to function well.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:55.660]   And so when the dollar goes up like it is, you know, because mainly because credit markets
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.100]   are becoming so much more expensive, it's becoming more expensive to get dollars.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.100]   So the demand for dollars is now, you know, rising and rising.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.260]   You get this knock on effect where it comes back to our shores in a way where you slow
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.180]   down everything else and the Fed ends up having to get involved because eventually it causes
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.660]   a slowdown in the United States.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:21.100]   So you've got kind of a double whammy here where the Fed is at risk of not only, I think,
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.060]   potentially causing a much or contributing to a much bigger slowdown in foreign markets,
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.940]   but you've got the domestic impact where are they actually managing the risks of the of
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:36.740]   the credit markets in the United States and, you know, really looking at this in a proactive
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:42.740]   manner where they're they're really managing the potential for something that starts to
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.340]   look a little bit like 2008 here in the next 12 to 24 months.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.580]   I don't want to just keep dunking on perm bears today, but remember when the dollar
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.460]   was going to collapse to that was another hyperinflation thing and the dollar is just
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.780]   stronger than ever.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.380]   I think today maybe people will say it's like the cleanest shirt in the laundry hamper.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.460]   But the next you mentioned housing, I want to get into that.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.340]   So Duncan, do the next question, because I think this is I think to me this is the biggest
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.260]   unintended consequence for the United States right now.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.780]   OK, what is going to happen in the housing market now that mortgage rates are 7% and
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.140]   prices are up about 50% since the start of the pandemic?
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.940]   John, throw the chart up here of housing as a percentage of GDP.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.300]   So this is from John Burns Real Estate Consulting, and they show that over time, historically,
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.260]   the housing market as a percentage of GDP.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.780]   So this is everything.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.860]   Housing costs, utilities, furniture repairs, maintenance, construction, all this stuff.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.260]   I think it's kind of hard to remember that there's so much that goes on with the transaction.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.060]   Not only the transactions where we have realtors, inspectors, loan officers, appraisers, movers.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.540]   I got an email this morning actually from a loan officer saying it's like tumbleweeds
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.700]   right now because, you know, they were living off of refinancing for years.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   He's like, we're 100% based on commission.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.640]   He's like, our office is basically screwed.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.740]   There's no transactions going on right now.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.220]   And so you also have the construction industry and the housing supply in the future.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:02.100]   And so obviously, like inflation, housing was not healthy in 2020 and 2021.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.220]   But this is not healthy either, where you've seen prices go up so much, incomes haven't
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.340]   kept up, and now rates double.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.300]   Prices would have to fall 40% or 50% to make these rates make sense, right, from a payment
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.300]   perspective.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.300]   I just don't see how this shakes out and how just, again, slamming the brakes on an industry
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.380]   like this that's this big and this important, I don't see how that ends well at some point.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.140]   I think this is the thing that the average listener is most panicked about too, based
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.100]   on like the questions we get, it's the housing element.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:38.620]   And it's like Ben was alluding to, it's a really, really big, important, I mean, there's
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:44.580]   entire economic research on the idea, the theory that housing is the economy essentially.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:49.740]   And so when you bring that sector, it's such a big component of fixed private investment,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:55.400]   which is a huge component of GDP, arguably the most important component of GDP.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.660]   When you bring that sector to a freeze, I mean, the knock-on effect is huge.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.740]   And it's not just the knock-on effect is specifically in the real estate industry, because obviously,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.420]   you potentially put a lot of mortgage bankers out of business, you put a lot of real estate
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.300]   brokers out of business, you halt new construction.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.900]   But this filters through all of the credit markets as well.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.960]   And that was the lesson from 2008 that I think really scared everybody was that it was, hey,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:28.740]   when this asset price falls by 20 or 30%, that has a huge knock-on effect on everyone
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.860]   else's balance sheet.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:35.220]   And that caused the entire credit quality of really the entire balance sheet of the
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.460]   private sector, and especially the household sector to basically collapse on itself.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.700]   And that's the thing, I'm not, I think Ben's written about this too, I'm not in the 2008
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.100]   camp where there's a lot of differences between this and 2008, especially from the credit
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.500]   quality side of the borrowers who have been buying homes lately.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.940]   Yeah, the loans people took out, they had much better credit quality.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.100]   The people have already locked in low rates.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.540]   It's not like they have these teaser arms that are going to reset at higher rates.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.140]   So from that perspective, the people that own homes are in a much better position.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.140]   But I just think-
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.620]   But it's still, here's the thing that scares me about this is that when you look at the
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:17.900]   price increase from the pre-COVID period, you're starting to see this with a lot of
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.980]   the sort of pre-COVID irrationality in some of the other markets where they're just reverting
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.700]   right back to where they were basically.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.740]   Like everyone's basically just repricing all this stuff saying, "Oh, that was a fun game.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.420]   That was kind of a dream, and we're now reverting right back to where we were pre-COVID."
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.260]   You could look at housing and make a really strong argument that that is a pretty rational
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.260]   position.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.580]   I mean, disposable income is only up like 15% since the pre-COVID period.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.000]   Well, here, John, throw Cullen's chart up here from disposable income.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.300]   So you have this chart of disposable income to housing prices.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.320]   And again, the thing that worries me is not that this didn't have to get fixed eventually,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.320]   it's the speed of it happening.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.220]   And I feel like people haven't taken the time to realize how this is going to filter through
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.820]   because it happened so- I mean, rates were 3% at the beginning of the year.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.660]   Now they're 7% and change, and it happened seemingly in the blink of an eye.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.700]   And that's the thing that I think from the Fed's perspective is somewhat reckless here
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.380]   is that this takes a really long time to filter through the economy.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.540]   Housing is a really big slow-moving beast.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:24.340]   And I mean, I remember 2006 when housing technically peaked, the yield curve was inverting, and
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.660]   it took 18 to 24 months.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.500]   I mean, you could have sat around and made bullish arguments about the U.S. economy for
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:37.220]   two years before that really started to materialize into something that was a noticeably really
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.760]   frightening event.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   And that's the thing.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.260]   I mean, Fed policy works notoriously with a lag.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:48.540]   I mean, Milton Friedman wrote a famous paper about this 50 years ago, and yet we're still
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:55.700]   willing to ignore not only the signs of inflation that were there last year, but now the signs
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.180]   of potential deflation across so many different sectors.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:05.300]   And the Fed is just looking at this stuff and saying, well, we need to keep the pedal
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:11.700]   to the metal here until we crash this car, and just ignore any of the potential risks
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.300]   that are happening in sectors that can cause really, really big asymmetric downturns.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   Right.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.340]   They seem to want it to happen very quickly.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.580]   So I think, I mean, if anything in the last 15 years has taught us is that inflation is
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.580]   hard to understand.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.420]   So Duncan, do the next question, because I think this is important.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.500]   Our understanding of inflation, to me, seems like ... The Fed obviously doesn't get it.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   I think a lot of people don't.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   So Duncan, go ahead with this one.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   Okay.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.100]   Is it possible that we simply don't understand enough about inflation to use monetary policy
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.940]   as the only way to slow it down?
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.980]   Because, I mean, obviously it's easy to dunk on the Fed now and say they missed the inflationary
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.820]   spike because they were still putting the gas pedal on a year ago.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.820]   But I think a lot of us don't.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.780]   So it's easy now to go through, and we have so many good macroeconomic thinkers that you
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.600]   can go to the BLS website and look at each single component and then how it's calculated.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.420]   You can go through all this stuff, owner equivalent rent, and look at all these different things
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.860]   and understand what the pieces are doing to inflation.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.540]   But I still feel like we don't really understand the levers to pull and how it's going to impact
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.580]   inflation in terms of monetary policy versus fiscal policy versus what happened with the
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.620]   pandemic.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:19.300]   All these things helped cause inflation, but we don't have ... You can't say fiscal policy
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.500]   caused 43% of it and monetary policy caused 13.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.540]   So I think that's the hard part for them is that, first of all, the Fed seems to be the
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.420]   only one that's trying to do something about inflation, and we don't know if their policies
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.580]   can do it or how long it is going to take besides throwing us into a recession.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:42.380]   I mean, and that's my big ... I mean, I've spent most of my adult life studying inflation
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.220]   because I basically think inflation is the most ... I mean, if you're looking at portfolio
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.860]   management, in my opinion, understanding inflation is probably the most important component of
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.740]   the whole construction, portfolio construction process.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:00.820]   And I always tell people, I still don't understand inflation.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.020]   Inflation is so confusing.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:07.820]   It's so dependent on specific economies and the way that things are actually functioning
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.220]   in certain environments.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.260]   Every environment's different.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.820]   Every economy's different.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.340]   Every policy response is different.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:21.180]   So there are infinite numbers of variables that go into the contributing factors of inflation.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.460]   And I think, I mean, the last two years are a perfect example of even the smartest people
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.140]   who study this stuff, they don't really have anything remotely close to a precise metric
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.060]   for understanding what is the causality even.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   Right.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060]   There's no model for this, right?
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.740]   That you can say, like, if we take these three inputs, put them in here, that's going to
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.700]   tell us what inflation is probably going to be.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.140]   No one knows this stuff.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.980]   And that's the worrisome thing is that I'm ... if anything, studying inflation is just
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.860]   really humbling.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.300]   It'll teach you that you really don't ... you don't know what you don't know.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:22:00.540]   And so that's the component where I'm always sort of worried about the tail risk, the asymmetric
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:06.180]   risk in all of this, where, okay, well, what if we get this wrong?
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:11.580]   You end up getting it wrong in a big, big way, in a way that causes a lot more collateral
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.580]   damage.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.980]   And to me, that's sort of the most important debate that's going on right now, is it, is
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.300]   this 1978 or is this more like 2008?
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.940]   And to me, there's just, there's not a lot about what's going on today that looks like
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.940]   the 70s to me.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.940]   You could maybe make the argument that like the stuff going on with oil and Russia, you
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.940]   know, is a little bit kind of reminiscent of like the 70s.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:41.300]   But aside from that, there's a lot of big underlying trends that this feels more, more
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:49.540]   closely aligned to a potential 2008 type of credit event rather than a sort of stagflation,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.420]   permanent high inflationary event.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.820]   So I don't, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.140]   I mean, I'm not, I'm, I'm not arrogant enough to say that.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.300]   Well, I mean, the thing is, we love these, we love these analogies because ...
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.740]   Towards like an '08.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.740]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.380]   So these analogies are fun because it makes it, you feel more comfortable that you know
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.380]   how it's going to end.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.700]   So I've been using like the World War II analogy where we had this huge spending come in and
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.080]   then you get this huge inflationary spike and then it, I mean, back then it got to like
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.080]   20%.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.260]   Obviously that was a much different, it felt like wartime spending for the pandemic.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.180]   But that's the hard thing is, is you could take little bits and pieces from each analogy
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.500]   and it's this, this beast just feels completely different because of what happened and, and
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.500]   the government response.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.100]   So you talk about like collateral damage.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.100]   So Duncan, do the next one.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.740]   Because I think this, this one to me is the one that's been hard to wrap my head around
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.140]   lately for how economists are viewing this.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.140]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.460]   And you and Michael talked about this on Animal Spirits, so yeah, people check that out if
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.460]   you didn't see it.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.340]   Why does it feel like economists are cheering for people to lose their jobs right now?
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.660]   Why are workers the ones being blamed for inflation?
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:51.060]   No, I know that economists try to sort of detach themselves and not be emotional, but
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.700]   you know, I would love it if we could figure out a way to, to not say we have to have the
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.620]   unemployment rate go from 3.5 to 4.5 and have a million people lose their jobs to just so
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.540]   we can get, bring price stability down because my thinking is, okay, the Fed has a dual mandate.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.660]   It's price stability and it's employment, right?
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   And so it seems like for a while right after the pandemic, the only thing they cared about
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.660]   was unemployment, right?
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.700]   And now the only thing they care about is inflation.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.540]   I guess that's my problem with what they're doing is, there doesn't seem to be a lot of
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.260]   balance and they're just, they're focusing on the extremes and that, that makes like
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.500]   things go back and forth and back and forth and the pendulum is swinging.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.420]   And so, I don't know, isn't, wouldn't it be nice if we could find a way to balance things
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.700]   out and maybe try to let inflation cool a little bit without a bunch of people having
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.700]   to lose their jobs?
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.500]   I know recessions are part of the, you know, that's the system we live in.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.300]   Like recessions are going to happen, but I guess my way of thinking is I would prefer
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.900]   not to have one if we don't have to.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.780]   I mean, that's the, you're kind of going back to what we were talking about before the,
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.340]   you know, the ebb and flow of all this stuff where, you know, some variance is natural.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.860]   Obviously, you know, people do stupid stuff.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.560]   You get, you know, booms and busts along the way.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.740]   The question is, is do a lot of these policies exacerbate the booms and the busts, you know,
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.580]   across, you know, the spectrum of time.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.620]   And that's the, that's the hardest variable to manage in all this because the Fed is,
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:13.020]   you know, the Feds now, they're super worried about having made the mistake that they did
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.020]   last year.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.380]   And I think now they're trying to play catch up, but now they're potentially operating
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:23.740]   such an impatient manner where the risk of them now creating the opposite, you know,
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.180]   mistake is increasing.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:31.240]   And so, you know, I think inevitably there is, you know, to some degree there's a give
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.020]   and take in terms of, you know, can you, can you have permanent low inflation and permanent
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.020]   low unemployment?
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.780]   No, there's going to be some ebb and flow in the way that the business cycle works.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.740]   That's just, you know, a natural part of the way the economy works.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:49.580]   The question is, is, you know, how much does that need to, do those variables need to actually
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.740]   gyrate over time?
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.780]   And I think, I think we're going to come out of this period and I think people are going
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.300]   to look back at the way the Fed managed interest rates and say, you know, is this the right
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.640]   way to be doing this going forward?
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.820]   Because I think that the discretionary manner in which they're sort of just shifting the
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:11.860]   car into, you know, reverse in sixth gear, as if like, there is no like one, two, three,
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.660]   four or five gear in between all of that is a worrisome.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.980]   And obviously, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, we can look back and say, these
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:28.060]   people are not very good at this, you know, and I'm not bad mouthing Jerome Powell necessarily.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.620]   I don't necessarily think anybody would be good at it.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.060]   And that's kind of, I think, one of the big lessons coming out of this.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.020]   It's easy to play armchair Federal Reserve Chairman.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.980]   So Duncan, do the last one because we'll put our own skin in the game here.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.980]   Okay.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.980]   And I want to throw a disclaimer on this one.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.180]   Keep in mind that we are policy influencers.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.140]   And so we have people on the Hill watching who are making policy based on what we talk
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.140]   about here.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.900]   So, you know, it's a lot of responsibility.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.020]   What would you do if you were running the Fed right now?
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.860]   So obviously, like, this is not a job that I would want because there's so much pressure.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.340]   And I think one of the big mistakes they made is this just I think this is just natural
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.020]   because of the way the free flow of information.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.300]   I think that the Fed is talking way too much these days.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.000]   I think they say too much.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.900]   And I think part of them kind of likes the power they have that they hold.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.140]   And remember, back in the day, people were looking at Alan Greenspan's briefcase to see
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.100]   if it's if it's thick, he's going to do something, if it's thin, he's not going to do something.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.700]   Now the Fed, there's a Fed statement every day, it seems like.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.220]   And they talk and the market moves, and I feel like they kind of enjoy that power a
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.220]   little bit.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.700]   And they're human, so who can blame them?
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.640]   But I just think, to your point about things working on a lag, I think especially with
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.720]   Treasury rates at four to five percent coming from zero, in mortgage rates at seven coming
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.020]   from three in such a short period of time, now's a great time to just take a breath and
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.700]   let's just see what happens.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.260]   It's not you could say if inflation stays high, we're going to we're going to use that
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.060]   data and five or six months down the line, we'll we'll raise again if inflation stays
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.060]   high.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.300]   I think it's a great way to show a little patience here, that that'd be the thing that
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.340]   I would look.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.140]   Stocks and bonds have already crashed, housing prices are rolling over.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.180]   My point is, like, what's the rush here?
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   Why?
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.220]   It's because it's going to take some time, regardless of how it happens.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:12.180]   Yeah, I mean, I've got I, I got up and left DC 15 years ago, moved to the beach in California.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.300]   So you know, I, I always joke around that.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.580]   I think everyone at the FOMC, everyone in the Federal Reserve should do something similar.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.180]   Like, you know, get up, leave, fire yourself.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.740]   And I mean, you could set you could easily set interest rates on I mean, there's some
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.140]   theories that say, hey, the the overnight rate should just permanently be zero.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.380]   You know, I'm not an advocate of that.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:39.300]   But you could set up a really simple algorithm that just even if even if the overnight rate
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.060]   was pegged at, you know, something close to like the rate of inflation, or you could set
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:49.380]   up a moderated like, you know, or modified Taylor rule where like, the, you know, the
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.860]   interest rate could change to some degree, but it stayed within like a band of like,
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:58.140]   like I theorize, I've theorized in the past that like, it can move from like two to like
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.900]   five within a band over time.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.940]   And it would just be completely out of algorithm based, completely automated, data dependent.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.100]   The Taylor rule is somewhat forward looking.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.820]   So someone calling someone asked us this a couple weeks ago, like, could the Fed be more
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   rules based?
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.420]   And my thinking was 95% of the time they could and the other 5% during a crisis is
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420]   when you need them.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.100]   But I think what we're learning now is that the Fed is way better at stepping in during
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.860]   a crisis than they are at pulling the punchbowl away like they they know what to do during
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.860]   a crisis.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.260]   And I think that's actually easier, the easiest part of their job.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.980]   And I think Powell did a great job in the pandemic.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.900]   I think obviously, the other way they're showing that that that's much harder to know what
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.900]   to do and when.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:43.060]   Totally, you know, and that's the thing, a lot of that tangential stuff, like, you know,
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.380]   having to manage things like a credit facility that goes to, like, you know, Bear Stearns
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.300]   or, you know, a big investment bank that's in dire need of something unusual.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.340]   That's a very different scenario than the everyday management of something like interest
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.420]   rates, like interest rates for the most part, I think could be it could be very automated,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.740]   systematic, something that people just were mostly hands off with.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.900]   And of course, even that model will have its flaws, but at least it won't have the discretionary
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:18.660]   impact that we now kind of know almost always lags because people are just bad at predicting
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.660]   stuff.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.980]   I mean, everybody, literally everybody is bad at predicting stuff.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   And so but you still need even if you had this like self-driving car version of Fed
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.620]   policy, you still need somebody behind the wheel.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.620]   You need someone to pay attention.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.220]   The car kind of starts to get wobbly.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.980]   And so I think that's I mean, that's what I would do, frankly.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.180]   I would you still need people manning the ship, but you don't need like you said, you
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:48.540]   don't need 20 people doing speeches every day, just yabbering about what's going on
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:53.900]   with the economy and talking things, you know, off of what looks like a cliff edge here.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.380]   So this might be I was just going to say it might be a stupid question, but I've always
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.900]   wondered why do we have all these different locations of Feds?
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.260]   Like what's the.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.340]   They're like often they're offering different opinions on stuff.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.820]   It just seems kind of part of the banking system, right?
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.020]   Yeah, different spots for the banks in those areas kind of really like back when the Fed
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.900]   was formed and the as it kind of developed, I mean, the banking system wasn't very integrated.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.180]   And so it wasn't very nationalized.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:26.060]   And so you had all these Fed districts that were they were kind of managing specific locations
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.420]   across the country and which now looks kind of silly because it's like, well, it's just,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.820]   you know, I send a wire transfer and it doesn't matter whether you're in San Francisco or
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.580]   New York, like it just goes through.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:44.100]   So it's kind of a I mean, a lot of the a lot of the structure of the Fed, a lot of the
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:51.060]   a lot of the existing management of it is somewhat archaic, you know, and that's, I
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:57.100]   think, becoming more and more of a problem as as the monetary system evolves.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.220]   So there was a story today that St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard gave like a behind
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.580]   the scenes speech to Citigroup.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.340]   People are kind of up in arms about that, that the Fed moves markets.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.980]   I think after today, the Fed is not going to be coming on Portfolio Rescue.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.460]   We're a little harsh.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   It is what it is.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.460]   Cullen, where can people find your work?
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.060]   Yeah, I feel like you might be fired from the Fed, Ben.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.460]   It's I turned my resignation a while ago.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.540]   Cullen, where can we send people to find your work?
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.220]   Pragmatic Capitalism is my blog.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.780]   I run an investment management firm called Discipline Funds.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.780]   But yeah, the blog, Twitter, Cullen Roach on Twitter.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.060]   So if you want to hear more boring stuff about the Fed, you know, that's where you can find
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.060]   me.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.060]   Thank you, Cullen.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.060]   We appreciate it.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.060]   Yeah.
