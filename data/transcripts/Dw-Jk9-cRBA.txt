[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.180]   Matthew in Edmonton, Alberta writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I was wondering how
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.980]   exactly to go about casting my anxieties on the Lord.
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.480]   For example, do I need to pray and explain every anxiety I have, or can I just trust
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.520]   Him without signifying it with prayer, much like conversion does not need to be signified
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.080]   with a prayer?
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.280]   Maybe I'm thinking too mechanically about it because I end up feeling more anxious about
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.760]   it and I feel I'm not explaining the anxiety well enough.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.600]   So I get anxious that I'm not casting every little anxiety on Him."
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.080]   Pastor John, what would you say to Matthew?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:49.320]   Overly introspective people can get so tangled up in the processes of sanctification that
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   they are paralyzed.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.560]   And Matthew seems to wrestle with that tendency.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.960]   I'm making a judgment call.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.720]   He can decide if I'm right or not.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.920]   A lot of us are like that.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.120]   It is good to be introspective.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.040]   If I don't know what I'm feeling, I won't know whether I should give thanks to God for
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.280]   His blessing or counter Satan's assault.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.480]   If you're never introspective, you don't know what you're feeling, then you don't know how
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.320]   to do anything spiritually.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.560]   So we have to be aware of what's going on inside of us.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.120]   So yes, amen.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.560]   Matthew's doing the right thing in analyzing his own soul in that regard, but there is
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.320]   an unhealthy preoccupation with ourselves that can produce no good fruit.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.040]   So for example, if you're feeling anxious and you ask God to give you peace, it won't
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.920]   work to fix your gaze steadily on your soul and analyze whether the peace is happening
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.360]   or not.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.440]   You'll never have peace that way.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.680]   Why not?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.800]   This is going to take us into the answer to Matthew's question about what it means to
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.920]   cast your burdens and your anxieties on the Lord.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   It does not mean cast them and then stare at the soul to see if it feels unburdened
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   or anxiety-free.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   And the reason that won't work, and you can't have peace that way, is that our souls were
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.960]   made to be drawn out of themselves to Christ.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.320]   We're made to be drawn out, our focus to be drawn out, our attention, our love, our admiration,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.960]   our focus is to be drawn out to Christ.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.040]   This may be the most important thing I could say to Matthew that he needs to get a handle
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.000]   on introspection or looking at the state of our souls to see if they're peaceful or if
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   they're anxious or if they're coveting or if they're lustful or if they're puffed up
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.040]   or if they're ungrateful.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.840]   The reason for that inward look to see if we're in the grip of any of those things is
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.600]   to help us know what to look to Christ for.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:22.480]   Let me say it again, the reason for the inward look is to know better what to look to Christ
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.920]   for.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.840]   Look to Christ for.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.360]   Look to Christ for.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.840]   Christ is our peace.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.760]   Christ is our safety.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.440]   Christ is our righteousness.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.480]   Christ is our satisfaction, which means that the key to experiencing peace and safety and
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:50.040]   holiness and satisfaction is to look steadily, steadfastly to him and not to whether our
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.120]   souls are having those experiences or not.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.480]   Now, let me be a little more practical, a little more specific to what Matthew is asking.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.400]   I think the answer specifically to his question about how to cast our anxieties on the Lord
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   is made problematical because Christ is invisible.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.820]   You can't see him, and I'm telling you, look at him, look at him.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.600]   So what do I mean when I say look to him?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.640]   And what I mean is look to his promises.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   We see Christ through the Word of Christ.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.560]   First Samuel 3, 21, "The Lord revealed himself to Samuel by the word of the Lord."
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.520]   He revealed himself by the word of the Lord.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   That's how we fix our gaze on the Lord.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.080]   That's how we go out of ourselves to the Lord.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.560]   We see him through his word.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.280]   So practically speaking, we get outside ourselves and experience the peace of Christ by fixing
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.960]   our consciousness on a particular promise that God has for us because of Christ.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.660]   All the promises of God are, yes, in Christ.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.840]   We fix our gaze on one of those promises, and we see Christ speaking to us through that
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   promise.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.080]   I did that so many times, Tony, as I stood up to preach.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.560]   It was as though the Lord just looked me right in the face and said, "I will help you."
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.480]   And that was a quotation from Isaiah 41.10.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.800]   I didn't make that up.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.740]   He said that to me.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.360]   And so that's what I mean by meeting the Lord in his word.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.220]   So Matthew, if you want to get the whole picture of how I work on this, the book Future Grace
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.780]   is what that's about, or the boiled-down version of Future Grace is called Battling Unbelief.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.920]   So one last thing.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   You ask, "Do I need to pray and explain every anxiety I have, or can I just trust him without
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.800]   signifying it with a prayer?"
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:07.720]   Okay, I hear what he's saying there, because it says in Philippians 4, "Let your requests—don't
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.000]   be anxious about anything—let your requests be made known to God."
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.960]   And he's saying, "Do I have to do it with every anxiety all day long?"
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.000]   Well, it doesn't say, Matthew, it doesn't say, does it, how often to let your requests
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   be made known.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.280]   It just says, "Let them be made known."
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.760]   So here's what—here we are sitting together, Matthew, you and me in a counseling room.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.200]   I'm sending you out with this practical counsel.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.560]   The way I would suggest that Matthew go forward is this.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.780]   At the beginning of every day, call to mind from the Word some promises, two or three
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:52.040]   or one, promises of God that relate to the typical anxieties that might crop up that
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   day.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.920]   You're going to be going through a storm in that day, and he finds a promise or two
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.480]   that relates to that.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.640]   Then pray and ask God to help you believe that promise.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   I would say, Matthew, write one of those down on a little piece of paper and stick it in
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.160]   your shirt pocket, and then head out into your day.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.360]   And periodically, periodically—don't ask me how many times, just as you feel led—periodically
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.800]   through the day, pull out that little piece of paper, read that promise, and say to God,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.680]   "Help me trust this promise," and then enjoy him saying the promise back to you.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.680]   "I will help you.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.880]   I will strengthen you," and go back to the work that you're doing.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.320]   And don't worry that over the next two hours you're not going to be saying to the Lord,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   "Help me," because you're concentrating on your computer programming or whatever you're
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.880]   doing.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:52.400]   In other words, you don't have to be asking for help consciously all day long.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.120]   There is a rhythm, a rhythm of life in the Holy Spirit, and he'll guide you what that
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.960]   rhythm is.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   Wonderful word.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.200]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Matthew.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.280]   For more details about those books, "Future Grace" and "Battling Unbelief," go to DesiringGod.org
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.880]   and click on the "Books" tab at the top of the homepage.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.320]   As always, this is the easiest way to find John Piper's books.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.440]   Most of them you can download in their entirety for free, and it is possible because we have
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.040]   generous financial donors who support our work and who I know listen to this podcast,
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   so thank you.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.160]   Will Pastor John encourages Christian leaders to give their lives to build a risk-taking
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.960]   local church?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.840]   That's tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.880]   We'll see you then.
