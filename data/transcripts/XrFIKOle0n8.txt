[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   know, I said for that advice for people in their teens, they should go to San Francisco.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.160]   And I wonder for people in their 20s, if they like shouldn't go to San Francisco.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.040]   I feel San Francisco, the entrepreneurs are held in excessively high regard in my view. And look,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:25.680]   I guess I like entrepreneurs. There is a set of career paths that I think some set of people
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.840]   ought to pursue and would derive most fulfillment from pursuing that are really valuable for the
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.400]   world if pursued, that require accumulating a lot of expertise and really studying a domain
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   in tremendous depth. And I think San Francisco valorizes, and look, this is also San Francisco's
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.320]   great virtue. San Francisco valorizes a kind of striking out on your own, iconoclastically
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:03.840]   dismissing the sort of received wisdom and the founding archetypes and lore of the Steve Jobs
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.720]   and the Bill Gates and all the rest. And I'm way less successful than those people, but to some
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.880]   extent Stripe, in as much as it fits a pattern, is an instance of that pattern. And look, that's
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.120]   great. And I'm kind of happy that that phenomenon exists in the world, but the world needs lots of
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.240]   other things, right? And I don't think San Francisco particularly, I mean, I'm again using
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.080]   San Francisco as a kind of metonym for a cultural orientation, but I think that San Francisco doesn't
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   really encourage the pursuit of really deep technical depth. And we're recording this in
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.920]   South San Francisco, most noteworthy in the corporate world for of course being the headquarters
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   of Genentech, co-founded by Bob Swanson and Herb Boyer. And they produced cheap insulin for the
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.040]   first time with recombinant DNA. Herb Boyer couldn't have done that at age 23. Herb Boyer
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.440]   first had to accumulate all of the knowledge and the skills required to be able to invent that over
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.880]   the course of a multi-decade career. And then, I don't know what age he was when he finally went
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.560]   and invented it, but he was not in his 20s. And I feel San Francisco perhaps doesn't culturally
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920]   encourage one to become Herb Boyer. I don't quite know how to synthesize it yet, but as I think
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.680]   about advice for people in their 20s, look, I'm not going to normatively pretend or presume to
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.840]   know kind of in which direction one should go in one's life. And obviously there are successful
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.240]   examples of basically every strategy. And I'm really glad that you're doing what you're doing
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.640]   at what age? 23. 23. So that's- Wait, a podcast isn't. I'm not inventing recombinant DNA here.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.560]   Look, I think information dissemination is a really valuable thing in the world.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.960]   Anyway, I don't presume to know what people should do with their lives, obviously, but I wonder in
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.400]   as much as I'm trying to give advice, and especially maybe if they're reading my advice and not someone
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   else's advice, maybe they're kind of thinking about career paths that look sort of directionally
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.080]   like mine. I think my advice might be, maybe you should do something like what I did or I'm trying
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.640]   to do, but there are other paths as well. And I think a lot of really important invention in the
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.360]   world and a lot of the things that I'm most happy are happening actually require a very different
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   trajectory. And I think there were counterfactual versions of my life where I pursued that path and
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.360]   well, who knows how well it would have worked. So what practically does that look like to hone
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.520]   your craft in any of these disciplines that take a long time? I mean, you've spoken and tweeted
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.080]   about some of the problems with modern universities. Is that still the de facto path if you want to be
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.280]   the great biologist that Ark hires or something? In many domains, I don't know, right? So in
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.600]   hardware, which is not a small domain, most things in the world involve stuff and things,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.760]   and I just have no facility with or experience with doing things in hardware. And so if you
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.400]   want to become like a super skilled practitioner there, what's the best career path? I don't know.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:15.280]   Maybe it's to drop out and join SpaceX or something. I'm not necessarily endorsing
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   just pursuing the most establishment and credential-oriented path. I think people
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.440]   should try to find the gradient of maximal learning in whatever it is they care most about.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.560]   For biology, look, not that I'm a biologist, but it is very clear that in order to do really good
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   work, there are a lot of bench skills one has to acquire, and then there just is a lot of actual
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.840]   specific knowledge. There are very few successful pure autodidacts in biology where you, at some
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.240]   point, in virtually every case that I'm aware of, have to have had direct experience in and with a
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   top lab where you're seeing how people actually do it in practice. I think software is different
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.320]   to many other domains where you can learn a very significant fraction of the craft and the practice
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.520]   while being sort of a dog online and just kind of watching other people do it. In software,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   more of it just takes place in a remotely consumable fashion. You can watch the factory,
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.720]   so to speak, through open source and mailing lists and GitHub and things like that in a way
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.040]   that I think isn't the case for pharmacology or for sophisticated manufacturing or for
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:36.880]   semiconductors. Maybe one version of what people in the '20s should do is get some ideas to domains
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.440]   you're interested in or care about, but then figure out where can you learn the highest standards,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.280]   where are the highest standards embodied, and where can you go and experience that firsthand?
