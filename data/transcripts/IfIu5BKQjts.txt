[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.080]   We'll try to get through as many questions as we can before we do the Karsak Chan.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.240]   The first question is from one of our visitors from Holland, Marius.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.640]   He says, "Dear Jack, what would you do if you today were 40 years old, living in Europe,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.360]   and the effective cost of investing in a global index fund was 1% a year?"
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.480]   Move to America.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.020]   It is amazing how the cost structure in the U.S. is terribly stacked against the investor,
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.080]   and this is probably the cheapest country to buy mutual funds in.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.880]   I'm not sure that the overall brokerage system is any cheaper, but the mutual fund expense
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.520]   ratios are lower, and I can remember, we used to have to have the index fund start to get
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.520]   a little recognition.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   It took a long, long time.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   People would come in.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.680]   I remember one group from Germany, and they said they'd want to start an index fund, and
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.720]   not quite the way they said it, but that was close, and we got a little bit of, what a
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.840]   great idea, blah, blah, blah, and they said, "Now, for it to work for us, we need to take
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   1% a year out."
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   Well, I said, "You know, there goes the index fund.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.640]   There's not any point in an index fund if you're taking 1% a year out for distributing.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.000]   You can probably charge another 1% for managing it, and there goes all the magic."
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.180]   So they left, and I really like to let people down easily, but there's no point in beating
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.400]   around the bush either, and that is a whole offense on the efficiency with which you provide
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.800]   the index.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.360]   So for a European investor, first that involves, I think, extremely interesting asset allocation
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.160]   problems, but I'm just talking about the central problem, which I think is the cost problem.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.360]   The asset allocation problem is one I've tried to deal with a little bit intellectually,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.760]   which is, I believe that it's fine to have all your money in the U.S.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.120]   We've beaten that ground over and over again.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.880]   Everybody tells me I'm wrong, and I need a little reinforcement.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   I hope somebody else will tell me I'm wrong this week.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   The more I hear about it, the more I'm sure I'm right, but it's easily to be -- I could
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   easily be wrong.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   You know, I can't predict the future of the markets, but when you get to a European investor
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.800]   or an Australian investor, you know, they want some balance between their home country,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   I think, but not if you're in Finland, where there's only one company that's 80% of the
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.320]   Finnish market, Nokia, and so it changes from country to country, but for a European investor,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.720]   leaving the cost aside, I'd say you probably should -- you know, even if you're, God forbid,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.440]   in France, in the U.K., much better in terms of their economy and their prospects for none
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.040]   of this economic mess that we have all over the world, but maybe 25% in your home country,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.640]   25% or 50% -- I know it's a big difference -- in other international non-U.S. and 25%
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.080]   to 50% in the U.S., something like that, I think, is the intelligent thing to do, but
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.280]   I'm glad I'm not facing that option with this nice person in France.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.760]   Or where were they?
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.960]   Holland?
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.640]   >> Holland, yes.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:47.480]   >> The next question says, "Dear Jack, would you recommend an individual invest all of
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.440]   their assets into Vanguard firms, or spread the risk to one or more other index fund ventures?"
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> Well, it's a -- basically, it's a cost-benefit analysis.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.520]   Clearly, I would, you know, owe my own money as a vendor, and I'm not worried about the
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.320]   company going down, although to bring up an issue I did not touch on, we probably are
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:15.560]   a systematically important financial institution, S-I-F-I, and I think we giant fund managers
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.600]   are going to have to be -- get used to a little more government oversight, whether we like
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.640]   it or not.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.600]   I mean, $2 trillion is a lot of money, it's 5% of the U.S. stock market, and the mutual
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   fund industry is a top five firms.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.240]   I think this latest report, the government said this, top five firms with 50% of the
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.320]   assets in the fund industry, and that kind of -- and they're almost all index firms,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.000]   by the way, all except IMCO, and you could argue they were a close-to-index firm anyway
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   when you get to the bond area, and their correlation is probably 95 or something like that, very
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.200]   high, because they tend to be in the bond area.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.920]   And so we have to be very, very much aware of all that, and still, you know, if you want
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.240]   to have, let's say, half of your money in Vanguard and half somewhere else, first I'm
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.680]   hard-pressed to tell you where to put the other half, and second, you're probably going
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.200]   to have higher costs, so is that higher cost going to be worth the -- maybe sleeping at
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   night better feeling?
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.920]   And, you know, honestly, if I had money in some other mutual fund group, I would sleep
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.160]   less well at night.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.600]   I'm an insider at Vanguard, or sort of an insider, or a former insider, or a quasi-insider,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:37.640]   or a virtual insider, or some kind of an outsider, I'm not sure which, but I'd say no problem.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.520]   We all have the same, basically, protections, custodianships, and I'd say, given the character
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.080]   of our company, you should be able to be comfortable that there aren't going to be ethical barriers
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.440]   or breaches, or ethical breaches that jeopardize the value of your securities, or administrative
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.960]   burdens that will, say, not give you liquidity when you need it, although I worry about -- you
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.520]   know, I worry about just about everything, I guess, but I worry about the value of liquidity
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   in the mutual fund industry.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.560]   You know, maybe if we were less liquid, we would have more long-term holders, for example.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.120]   I mean, the promise of liquidity, as we all know, is something that not everybody can
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.400]   have at the same time, and so when you get to our level, particularly in something like
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:34.440]   municipal bonds, where the markets are very not-so-darn liquid, and so you do have those
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.120]   kind of problems, and could have those kind of problems if Vanguard were by far the largest
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.520]   municipal bond manager, and I should have the answer to this question.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.160]   I don't, but I require them to have a 15% liquidity reserve at all times, because we
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.920]   had such a cost advantage that we still had a competitive yield, having 15%, basically,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.560]   in very short-term, and this was cash-ready, just in case, and that came up in 2007 when
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.880]   we had a crisis in the municipal bond market.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.920]   Ian McKinnon, who ran our bond funds, was in the hospital at the time, so I was running
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.200]   the bond funds, and I was, you know, the portfolio managers, basically reporting to me during
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.240]   this period.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.400]   That was an awful period, because the bond market was falling apart, our shareholders
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.960]   wanted a lot of liquidity, and we had to provide it, and that's the first thing you do.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.680]   You say, "We're going to have the liquidity," and no matter what, I can remember the bond
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.160]   managers, they'd handle one more anecdote, come in and saying, "Well, you know, Goldman
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.040]   Sachs is bidding, we have to sell some bonds, and Goldman Sachs is bidding $95.5 for these
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.840]   bonds, and they're worth $98, and what should I do?"
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.680]   And I said, "The answer is very easy, but I've been thinking about, sell them.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.640]   Sell them, because that's the going market, that's what you can get for them, you have
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.560]   to have the cash, there's no way around that, and believe me, if I know Goldman Sachs is
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.400]   bidding $98.5 today, they'll be bidding $95 tomorrow, so get them the heck out of there."
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   And so we survived that crisis, and that's where the whole idea of the Swiss Army came
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:09.480]   up for the first time, and training people at Vanguard to be the guys that would think
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.880]   about answering the phones just a little beneath them, perhaps, and just, they were always
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.080]   ready, we had, we were all trained to handle telephones, so we didn't get lines backed
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.960]   up and all that, and they also learned something very important, particularly the portfolio
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.200]   managers, that there were human beings who owned their funds, and it wasn't just some
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.320]   big numbers game, and I think that was at least an equal part of it as compared to being
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.160]   ready for an emergency, which of course, when you're ready for an emergency, that doesn't
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:47.080]   usually happen, so we've been from 2007, no, 1990s, that year was that crisis, I guess
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.800]   1987, 1987 when all this happened, when we were much smaller, but it was still a big
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.680]   problem, and that's when the Swiss Army began, and I think that's been a good thing for us,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.800]   so much is electronic now, compared to telephone, that probably is less necessary, but I think
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.280]   the training of letting people know that there are human beings on the other end of that
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:14.840]   telephone is absolutely central to everything I believe about company philosophy.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.040]   I think this question relates to, if I remember correctly, an article in the Financial Times,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.720]   Victoria asks, "Jack, are we parasites?"
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.680]   Well I could have talked about that earlier, but that's where these diversions come in,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:38.920]   and intrude on my day, and make me push things aside to respond, and there was a very, I
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:46.760]   think, naive article by a UK money manager, saying that indexing was parasitical, because
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.960]   it took advantage of the efficient markets created by active managers, so we didn't contribute
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:00.280]   to the efficiency, but we capitalized on it, and first place, that has nothing to do with
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.440]   me today, but I've never believed totally in efficient markets, I believe sometimes
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:14.520]   yes, sometimes no, long run almost certainly yes, short run almost always no, but I did
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.040]   take the guy on, he mentioned me, and he mentioned Vanguard, about being the fomentors of this
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.480]   parasitical behavior, but I took him on, and actually, I changed the question a little
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.800]   bit, and I said, "Look, a parasite, there's this host body over here, and the parasite
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.600]   is taking something out of it, and in this business, we're all parasites, no question
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:41.640]   about that, we're a parasite that takes six one-hundredths of one percent out of the host
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.480]   body, that's the market return, and you, sir, are a parasite that takes two and a half percent
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:54.840]   out of the host body, and if you don't think that's important, compound it over, wow, so
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.760]   we had a little back and forth, he wrote back, I didn't answer his third thing, but I felt
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:06.440]   better after having done it, the FT has always been extremely kind to me in my ideas, and
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.600]   it's kind of nice, I have some, maybe a little bit financially snobbish friends who won't
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.640]   read the Wall Street Journal, won't read the New York Times, they read only the FT, and
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.880]   it's a good paper, and I like to joust, and they're always asking, everybody's always
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.400]   asking me for articles about this and that, and sometimes I do it, and sometimes I don't,
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.240]   and if I can tell you, can I give you one more anecdote, this was the most fun one,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.320]   so my granddaughter is coming into the office to have lunch with me, and at ten o'clock
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:42.520]   in the morning I get a note from the op-ed page editor, Taku Banshanaria, his name is,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:49.320]   the one at that time in the journal, and he said, this little, had a title with no message,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:56.760]   don't you dot, dot, dot, hate the books, and I wrote back to him and said, of course I
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.880]   do, it's a whole bunch of self-important people getting together to reinforce each other's
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:10.280]   misguided ideas, so he said, can you give me a thousand words on it, and I said, sure,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.560]   when do you need it, and he said, three o'clock this afternoon, and I was not about to cancel
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   lunch with my granddaughter, believe me, so I drafted up something real quickly, why I
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:30.040]   wasn't going to Davos, and then I came back from lunch after she left, lovely young woman,
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.880]   hate to see her go, lunch was over, and edited, and got it in by three o'clock, because it
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:42.680]   had to be in time for the European edition, and so it got a lot of criticism, it was fun
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.240]   to write, probably one of the best things I've ever written, actually, and it ended
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:54.680]   up by saying, well, one reason I'm not going to Davos is I wasn't invited, and the other
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.840]   reason is I don't know how to get there, but I didn't read that President Clinton was flying
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.720]   over for the final session, so if he reads this and offers me a ride in his plane, I
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:12.600]   will be there, so I hope you're allowed to have a little fun in this business, I certainly
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.240]   had my share, sorry to take that time, go ahead, Mel.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.560]   You've got all the time you need, John, Glenn says, I agree with Jack's critique of the
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.960]   total bond index tracking, how likely is it to change, and if not, what funds should we
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.240]   add to our portfolio to get better corporate exposure?
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.000]   Well, good question, and I want to emphasize that I may be a little bit of a purist on
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.440]   this, the differences are not large between us, I'd say the index properly weighted, we
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:51.480]   had things like 25% of all treasuries were held by China and Japan, a little bit from
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   the UK, I think, and so why are they counted when the idea is how are you going to perform
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.280]   relative to your neighbors, let's call it US pension, retirement plans, and US investors
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.320]   generally, they just aren't part of that equation, and people can disagree with that, fine, but
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   that's my position, and then they have a lot of shorter term treasuries, that I think are
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:20.760]   much more accurately kind of in the short bill or very medium, less than short term
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.480]   government bonds, and they're in the index, why would anybody want to be that short, that
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:31.560]   said, the differences are not huge, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be striving for perfection
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.160]   even though you'll never get there, but the option is, I think, and I actually did this
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.880]   when the spreads got so wide, a very rare move for me to make, I moved a fair amount
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:52.200]   of my money out of total bond market into corporate intermediate term index, and that's
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:00.680]   done fine, all those gaps of 2008 have been pretty much ironed out, I'm not sure it matters
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.320]   that much anymore, but I just leave it in there, so there is an option of corporate
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.880]   intermediates, and I'm trying to think here, and I'm probably slipping a little bit, it
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.120]   could be fund run by Welling and active, but it's an index fund, it's got a correlation
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.560]   of 98 or 99 for the index, whether we call it active manager or not, and that's, I want
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:26.120]   to double underscore, when you talk about ETFs starting to have more and more active
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:33.720]   management, every single one except, I think, one so far is a bond fund, and active management
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.000]   of bond fund is day and night different from active management of the stock market, bond
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.520]   fund, the tolerances are like this, between active and index, and equity fund, the tolerances
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:50.120]   are more like this, between the nine or around that, so that's what you can do if you want
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:58.680]   to do it, although I think we need to lend a hand to the investor, who probably many
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:05.880]   of you in this room are dying for more income, and yet my philosophy is, if you're in the
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:12.040]   bond market, don't reach for more yield than the bond market is prepared to provide you
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:18.520]   with, it's like to use a very trite example, like crawling out on a limb, and you crawl
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:26.680]   out further and further and you're fine, and then all of a sudden, one step too far, snap,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:37.240]   a vigorous metaphor, and so, do it a little bit if you want to, I don't, I'm not a significant
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.480]   exception in my opinion, that I have done, but basically, the market returns a certain
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:51.240]   amount, and you just have to accept that, don't reach for more, it's a little bit like
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.720]   somebody, the analogy I've used, someone's lost the first seven of the eight races on
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.280]   the card, I think there are eight races on the card, if you go to the race tracks, and
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.640]   you take every penny you have, betting it on a long shot, in the eighth race, what you
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:16.840]   may recoup, the odds do not favor you, so try and stay within the simplicity, low cost
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   index, bond stock, and the like.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.880]   Here's a related question from Dan Smith, and he says, "Total bond is what it is, and
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:32.200]   the index of tracts is what it is, and my circumstances have not changed, how do I decide
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:39.240]   whether or not to hold my positions as long as I live, to put it one way, or hunker down
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.880]   in the Mark Lee's aggregate to put it another?"
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:52.760]   Well, basically, I'd go for hunkering down, we are, these relative yields will change,
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.680]   the one thing we do know is, today's yield has a 91% correlation, and will continue to
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:04.360]   have a 91% correlation, more or less, with the returns you'll get over the next 10 years,
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.920]   so if you buy a government bond today at 3% and a corporate bond at 4%, 4.5%, the odds
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.160]   are very high that you'll get a 4.5% return over the next 10 years, or a 3% return over
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:24.280]   the next 10 years, and so it favors getting a little more aggressive on the yield side,
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:31.000]   that said, we all have, I try and say that it's impossible to do, the idea of human behavior,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.360]   you know, is how will investors react, and I'm afraid that once you get a little opportunistic,
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:42.760]   and reach out for something else, you'll be much too sensitized, much too insensitized
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.720]   to the prices that the bond fund has, and bond funds have gone down a lot, although,
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.160]   you know, the reality is they haven't gone down nearly as much, I mean, you read these
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   scare things, this is a very important point, these scare things in the paper about what
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:02.040]   a terrible year this is for bonds, and I can tell you in my own experience, the way I do
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:10.840]   it, my bond portfolio has gone down 0.9% this year, and that's because I have half of them,
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:23.720]   Nunes are my direct holdings, tax free Nunes, and the limited term fund is down 0.1%, and
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:31.160]   the intermediate term, I don't do long, because it's behavioral reasons, you know, I don't
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.800]   want to mess myself up, is about 1.8%, so you put 50/50 in, you can see it's going to
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:42.120]   be over 0.9, and that's a turnover for me, and I wish I'd ever been in stocks, I always
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:49.000]   wish things like that, I always wish I'd ever been the best performing asset, but my magic,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.440]   such as it may be, is I never act in those beliefs, and that's really an important thing,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:04.280]   and don't let your behavior overcome, and you know, the lows in February, a little bit
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:11.000]   like the story I told you about Gus last night, I was scared, why wouldn't I be scared, I
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.320]   mean, everybody must be scared, so when you're scared, and say, you know, I really ought
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:25.240]   to do something about this, I go back and read my books, they put me to sleep a little
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:35.480]   bit, but. Jack, we have a comment here, on your comparison of active versus index funds,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:43.080]   all in cost, included transaction costs only for active funds, don't index funds have some
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.360]   smaller transaction costs? Yeah, that's a good question, and it's true, they do, but
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.120]   they are so small, that they, you can't find them in the performance funds, if you look
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.560]   at the Vanguard index funds, and you subtract our stated expense ratio, from the return
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:06.600]   of the index, you get the return of the fund, there are, the evidence says, zero actual
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.880]   cost, and they're so small, they don't even come out to 0.1%, and that's very intuitively
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   satisfactory, there are ways to do the trading, Gus is very good at that, has been, we know
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.880]   staff and people who are very good at it, and most index funds are the same way, there
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.080]   isn't much magic indexing anymore, we used to certainly be by far the best indexer, but
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.960]   everybody picks up the secrets, you know, there's no such thing, not like the Coca-Cola
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:37.800]   formula, which probably is worthless anyway, there's a parenthetical for you, but yes,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:45.480]   there are costs, but they are so small, they are not evident in the data. Jack, this, it
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.240]   says, in common sense, your 10-year forecast used average earnings growth, plus current
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:57.960]   dividend yield, for consistency, why not use average dividend growth? You could use average
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.280]   dividend growth, instead of earnings growth, it doesn't give you as good a result, as
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.920]   accurate a result, because companies' payoff ratios change, so if someone wants to argue
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:12.120]   that, it's the more pristine formula, and that's actually what we call the Gordon formula,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.680]   fairly well known in academia, the market value relative to the future cash flow, and
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.760]   this is, they call my thing the Bobo model, the Bobo variation on the Gordon model, I
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.280]   happen to like the earnings growth better, there's a great intellectual defense, isn't
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:35.880]   it? But it works in the data, and I think it's easier to follow, and you don't have
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.120]   to worry about changing payouts, which have changed a lot on the way down over time, but
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.760]   they're both approximations, and they're pretty good approximations, it's amazing
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.480]   to me how well that formula has worked, not formula for what the market will do, but formula
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.680]   for establishing reasonable expectations, I think I mentioned earlier, and what the
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.520]   markets will do, and none of this stuff is perfect, and I think we all ought to be aware
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.720]   of the fact that if you're looking for precision in any of these things, please don't look
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:13.400]   to me for it, I don't have any precision, I have a directional idea, I have a strong
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.120]   idea of what creates value in the marketplace, that is to say, earnings growth and dividend
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.640]   yields, and that's about it, and that's all you can control, but if it does work,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   it calls attention to being skeptical of what the market is doing for those fundamental
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   returns, investment returns, earned by corporate America, and that's why I say, and I'll
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.960]   repeat it once more, I think I said it last night, I'll repeat it again today, we're
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:47.240]   probably repeating it to our dying day, which I hope is not today, and that is, the stock
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.880]   market is a giant distraction to the business of investing, or to put it in a way I did
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:24:00.680]   to these professors down in Southampton and Bermuda, just trying to remember the exact
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:09.000]   formulation I used for them, about the stock market is a derivative, and the stock market
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.760]   is a derivative of corporate value underlying, created by corporate America, so think about
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.960]   the stock market, the stock price is a derivative of the value of the corporation, or the value
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.520]   of American business as a whole, and that gets you into the whole area of derivatives,
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.320]   what sense do they make, and the magnification of returns, which you saw on those charts,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.120]   magnified way up, magnified way down, and ignore it, because you know it's going to
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.920]   be in the long run zero, that's the nature of things, so am I dogmatic about this, you
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:44.840]   better believe I am, does Lenny doubt, anybody want to raise their hand, oh by the way, can
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:51.240]   I ask a question, we've had a little discussion about, and I talk about this in my financial
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   analyst journal article, about how to charge advisory costs, outside financial advisory
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.960]   costs, against accounts, against the returns that investors earn, and you kind of end up
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.880]   trying to approximate it, but I just want to ask you all, I'll express it in a simple
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.880]   way, and then just give me one second to explain, I'd love to see a show of hands of how many
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:23.800]   of you consider yourself do-it-yourself investors, and if you're not, how many of you consider
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.360]   yourself, you need an investment advisor, and there's a lot of ground between those
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.520]   two, the pure do-it-yourself means you get started, and you don't have somebody telling
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:39.320]   you anything to do, but your fellow bogleheads, however you feel, and the other is, you rely
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.720]   on an advisor to tell you everything, so I'd like to see a couple of hands, a number of
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:51.080]   hands that are available, how many of you consider yourself do-it-yourself, wow, the
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:59.720]   message is getting across, and how many would say they need significant help, I presume
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:09.320]   that excludes the help I'm giving you this morning, thank you, I'm not amazed at the
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.000]   dominance of do-it-yourself, but I am amazed that she seems to be unanimous.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.160]   The next question is very timely, Jack, it says, given the very low level of interest
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.840]   rates and the bull market of bonds for the last 30 years, can you tolerate the assertion
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:31.800]   that a person in his late 50s should have no allocation to bonds in his portfolio?
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:38.520]   Well, they're in economics versus emotions, the economics would suggest that no bonds
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.080]   is the correct decision, because we know the stock market returns, or we have reasonable
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.320]   expectations, that's all we can do, stock market returns will be about 7%, I think I
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.480]   mentioned this earlier, which will double your money in a decade, and then bond returns
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.520]   will be about 2.5%, I think maybe I used 3 before, which will get your money up 35%,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:02.840]   so you've got three times as much money in stocks as bonds, and if stocks let you down,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.920]   I just doubt very much that they will let you all the way down below that 2.5% or 3%
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:15.000]   on bonds, it would take an unusual combination of circumstances, or some kind of a crash,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.640]   and then there's the issue of, we live in, everything is a risk, we know that, and uncertainty
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:28.040]   cannot be eliminated, but we know that there are certain uncertainties out there that would
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:34.200]   destroy the value of both stocks and bonds, as if bonds would be exempt, and if a meteor
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   strikes the earth, it really wouldn't matter whether you own Vanguard or Fidelity, I don't
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:51.400]   think, I'm still hanging on to my Vanguard, but that's the economic side, and if you profoundly
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.720]   believe that, do that, and pay attention, as I mentioned before, very importantly, to
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.480]   the income stream you get, and not to the variation in price, because that gets you
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:08.280]   into the emotional side, and so when your emotions start to affect your behavior, we
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.600]   had another 50% market decline, I said something like this earlier, I'm going to use 40%, but
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.240]   whatever it is, you're going to want to change from an all-stock portfolio, with some little
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.480]   protection, an anchor to windward, call it whatever you will, dry pallets, and that's
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.040]   probably the worst timing in mind to do it, so if you think you can exempt yourself from
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:35.720]   emotional problems, I would say that's a good basis for investing, just go all the way,
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.200]   now, a lot depends on your time horizon, it's one thing if you're 22 years old, and one
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:51.160]   thing if you're 111, like yours truly, or something, but very few of us can really isolate
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.600]   our emotions from the economics of investing, so I'd say if you really feel like that, and
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:03.000]   it might be, let's say, 60/40 is a kind of conventional balance, and you really believe
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.760]   in equities, you know, make it 85/15, you'll get most of the return out of your stocks,
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.280]   the return on your portfolio out of your stock, but you'll still have that little comfort
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:23.400]   level that things fall apart, so economics, all stocks, emotions, maybe 85% stock.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:29.000]   Jack, this next one is based on a quote that you supposedly made, and I'll just read some
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.080]   of the highlights, but it's relating to the general state of the mutual fund industry,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:42.520]   specifically regarding money market funds, you supposedly stated that if the money funds
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:50.360]   got in trouble, that other funds would chip in to make the funds hold, so this question
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:56.120]   is, Mr. Borough, if you were running Vanguard, and money market funds got in trouble, would
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:05.320]   you assess the holders of Wellington and Windsor, or other Vanguard funds, to bail it out?
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:11.880]   Well, I'll give you sort of a hedged answer, unequivocally, no.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.440]   Do I make my position clear?
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:20.120]   I follow up to that, it says, if you wouldn't do that, would you just let it go down?
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:26.680]   Well, let me say, my whole framework for money market funds is here is an instrument that
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   can help a lot of people, a better way to save than money in the bank.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:37.080]   Yes, the yield is nothing right now, or essentially nothing, but no one will be that way forever,
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:44.200]   but the asset value of money market funds fluctuates, and to conceal that asset value
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:51.000]   fluctuation by holding to its so-called dollar price is, I think, leaving the public with
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.800]   a misleading impression of what they own.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:00.680]   So I would say, let the fund share value fluctuate, and then the marketplace will work, if someone
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:07.960]   thinks they're now moved to a $10 asset value, instead of a $1, and so it goes to $9.98,
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:14.440]   $9.96, whatever it might be, or $10.03 or $10.04, and whatever it might be.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.240]   Just treat it like a normal fluctuating value asset with very small fluctuations, and then
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:25.560]   you don't get runs, because the price is adjusting, and investors who, what happened the last
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:34.200]   time, as everybody, I think, knows, is the, they were trying to maintain, this is the
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.480]   Met, father and son, brothers, what's it called, institutional index fund, or something like
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:45.720]   that, and all these institutions could see what was happening when Lehman collapsed.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.680]   They had a huge amount of Lehman paper, over 1%, I think, and all of a sudden, Lehman collapses,
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.400]   and everybody knows that it's not yet in the asset value, but it will be tomorrow.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   See, you get out of today's price, these people are not stupid, these institutional managers.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.320]   The poor public is going to be a step behind, because you've got to be watching these things
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.080]   like a hawk, as corporate treasurers have to do, and are supposed to do, so you get
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.880]   this cascading effect, and you want to be the first to go, and you can get a dollar,
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.200]   even though they're giving you a dollar for something worth, let me say, 99 cents or 98
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.840]   cents, and that means for the half of what they're left in the fund, it's not 98 cents,
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:31.880]   but 96 cents, so I think it's an industry that was built on the wrong premise, and one
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.280]   of mine, I tell people to be quite blunt about it, but I'm thinking about writing one more
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.960]   book, I won't lose this tongue-in-cheek, and it's going to be the largest book I've ever
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:49.160]   written, it's called "Mistakes I Have Made," and the reality is, as I look back on those
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:55.960]   mistakes, that almost all of them were made for marketing reasons, for marketing reasons
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.040]   to make the thing look more attractive, or to jump on the bandwagon of a trend like real
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:08.680]   estate, or specialty funds, and that kind of thing, and it was just an unfortunate and
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.640]   opportunistic, and words I don't like to use about myself, and I've lived and learned from
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:22.360]   that, going back to the first merger in 1966, with the Boston Group, and we started the
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:28.280]   first money market fund with a $10 asset value, I mean, I was really speaking from the book
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.480]   that I just told you about, in "Fluctuated Ways, Let's Show the World It Fluctuates,"
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.800]   and nobody wanted it, there were all these funds for the $1 asset value, that was the
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:44.520]   mode, and so reluctantly, but I did it, it was my decision, no one else's, and so we
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.080]   changed to a $1 asset value, so my instincts led in the right direction, and it has not
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   cost us anything, I don't regard our money market fund as a big mistake, but I do hope
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:59.800]   that some group of statesmen in this business will get together and say, "Look, the value
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:05.400]   fluctuates, how bad is it to recognize that, and if a lot of people don't want their money
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.880]   market funds, well, that's just too bad, we're going to do it right, and let them put the
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.480]   money in some CD somewhere, or something like that, and that's going to be painful, much
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.720]   more painful for Fidelity than it is for us, although we have a decent-sized money market
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:26.520]   fund in the business, I guess about $200 billion, I don't know exactly, and so there's a point
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:32.440]   at which you have to do what is right for the marketplace, for the economy, and if it's
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:39.080]   painful, well, there's a lot to be learned, I'll take a little bit from this slide.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:45.160]   It would also be painful for the investors, because many investors use the money market
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.000]   funds for their checking accounts, so every time they wrote a check, it would be a taxable
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.240]   amount, so how do you address that situation?
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:00.680]   Well, it's the easiest thing in the world, I hate that excuse, did I make myself clear?
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:07.000]   I have a tax-exempt, short-term bond fund, it's basically a money market fund, actually
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.240]   I use limited term a little bit longer, and it's basically a money market fund with a
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.880]   floating asset, net asset value, and so I get a little statement saying, "Here are the
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.640]   gains, here are the losses, here are the wash sales, and put this little number right down
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.240]   here in your tax return."
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.400]   Well, what's the matter with that?
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:29.720]   It's a simple one number, easy to understand, easy to calculate, not easy for us to calculate,
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.440]   but Vanguard, and I presume other people, calculate it for you, and it's no different
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.600]   from having an equity fund, and you get a little 1099 that says here's what your income
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:44.360]   was, and here's what your capital gains were, if any, and so I don't see that that's a problem.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.840]   I can see it might be a minor irritation, and actually my moral value has kind of slipped
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:56.280]   here a little bit, but before we ever got into that kind of an accounting system, I
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.080]   still used the short-term, or the limited-term Unibond fund, and I knew every year I had
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.480]   some gains and some losses, and I didn't know how to take into account wash sales, because
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.680]   when you put money in, you're taking money out, that always comes up, and when you're
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.320]   getting paid, the dividend, that can even come up, and I didn't know quite what to do,
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:22.600]   I didn't have any numbers, so I guessed, I put in my tax return, $138 from long-term
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:28.280]   capital gains, and the next year I put in $272 from short-term capital losses, and the
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.320]   next year, I don't know what I put in, but I was never challenged, I wasn't trying to
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:39.000]   cheat, I just didn't know, but within a couple of years of doing that, we got the whole tax
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.640]   thing straightened out, it's complicated from a computer standpoint, but simple from an
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.600]   investor standpoint, so I don't have to guess anymore, and guess what, the gains were $138,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:55.720]   the losses were $274, whatever one wants to say about it, so it's, I think, a trivial
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.720]   inconvenience.
