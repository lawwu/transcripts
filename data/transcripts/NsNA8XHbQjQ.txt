[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   I have a shutdown ritual, which clearly demarcates the end of work and the start of the night
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.340]   after work.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.440]   And the shutdown ritual—so it has to—you have to close open loops, right?
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760]   So you got to make sure this is like a review type period.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.120]   Let me look back at my inbox and look at my plan.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.240]   Let me look at my time block and my calendar.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.400]   Really make sure—there's nothing urgent that needs to be dealt with that I didn't,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.280]   and there's nothing that's just in my head that I don't want to forget that's not
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.280]   written down somewhere.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   Like, take care of all of that, right?
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.000]   So you review all these things.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   You get what am I going to do tomorrow.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.320]   You don't have to build your whole plan for tomorrow, but you have a sense for it.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.560]   And then you need some sort of demonstrative thing you do to indicate that you finished
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.860]   a routine, right?
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.420]   So my longtime newsletter readers know I used to actually have a phrase.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.600]   I would say, "Schedule shutdown complete," like a crazy phrase, right?
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.080]   It's not how normal people talk, right?
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.520]   Now I have a planner that has like a checkbox that says "shutdown complete" next to
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   it.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.080]   The reason why that is a demonstrative anchor is that you use this then for cognitive behavioral
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.480]   therapy because at first people have a hard time shutting down work.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.280]   I mean, I invented this because I had a very hard time shutting down working on my dissertation.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.300]   I just—what, this proof doesn't work and blah, blah, blah.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.080]   So what you do is when you get a rumination post-shutdown, "Hey, what about—what's
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   going on with our work?
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080]   Are we doing the right thing?
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.280]   Do we forget this or that?"
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.780]   Instead of engaging in the rumination, well, it's like, "No, I think we're okay.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.280]   Let me think about my schedule tomorrow.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   What's my plan?"
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.920]   You instead can just say, "I said that crazy phrase," or "I checked that box."
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.320]   I wouldn't have said that phrase unless I had gone through everything and made sure
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.480]   that I had a good plan and nothing's being missed and it was okay to shut down work.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.520]   Because of that, I'm not going to engage with your rumination.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   I said the weird thing.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.000]   Let's get back to what we're doing.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.440]   This is like cognitive behavioral therapy that after a month or so, you are really able
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.040]   to actually effortlessly disengage from work and do everything—all the other stuff that
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.980]   matters without having the constant ruminations about work, which gives your mind an actual
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.620]   break to do other things.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.240]   So I mean this is more mental health and productivity.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.480]   But for me, it was critical.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.940]   I mean I can really remember when I came up with this, exactly where I was in my grad
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.940]   student career.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.920]   I mean there's just too many ideas and concerns that were just roiling.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.360]   Once I did this, it took a few weeks and then I could actually shut down and go on and do
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   other things.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.760]   The paired associative nature of the brain can make it really problematic if you're
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000]   thinking about work at the dinner table.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.660]   You start to associate the dinner table with work.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.240]   When Matt Walker came here to do this six-part series that's soon to be released and we
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.640]   were discussing insomnia, he said one of the major issues with insomnia is people who have
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.280]   trouble falling asleep or staying asleep will often stay in bed when they can't sleep.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   And then the bed becomes associated with challenges with sleep, hence the recommendation that
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.720]   virtually every sleep coach and sleep scientist recommends that people actually, if they can't
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.600]   sleep for 20 minutes or so of effort, then you get up and leave the bed and go someplace
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.840]   else until you feel sleepy enough to go back and try or fall asleep on the couch elsewhere.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.120]   I put that in as a note to you.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.560]   But this seems incredibly important also for enrichment of relationships with spouses and
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.080]   children and people in your life.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.880]   I mean, the problem is the first thing that we ask people when they walk in the door typically
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   was how was work today?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.880]   Or how was work?
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.320]   What did you do today?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.360]   Tell me about your school day.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   Tell me about your work.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.120]   Maybe we need to come up with better questions.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.680]   Like here's something interesting we could do.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.200]   Or here's like something I read about unrelated to work.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   No, I think it makes a huge difference.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.040]   Thank you for tuning in to the Huberman Lab Clips channel.
