[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.160]   Paul's epistle to the Philippians, in the third chapter, reading verses eight and nine.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.920]   Verses eight and nine in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Philippians.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.120]   "Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.400]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.280]   but done, that I may win Christ and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.160]   which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.200]   is of God by faith."
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.400]   We come back once more to consider this great statement which the apostle makes here in
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.280]   this third chapter of this epistle to the Philippians, a statement which is somewhat
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.560]   exceptional in his writings in that it is so autobiographical.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100]   That is unusual in the great apostle.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.040]   He was a man concerned to present the truth, but he does periodically refer to himself,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.640]   and he generally has a very good reason for doing so.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.240]   He always does it by way of illustration only, or by way of defense when his title to be
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.920]   called an apostle is queried, or when there is some grievous misunderstanding concerning
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   the truth.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.160]   That is the kind of way in which he does it here.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   There were these false teachers traveling the early church called Judaizers.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   Their teaching was that, yes, it was quite all right for one to believe the gospel, but
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.760]   that was not enough.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.160]   In addition, one had to be circumcised.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.400]   One had, as it were, to become a Jew and go under the law in order to be a true Christian
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.200]   and to get the maximum blessing from God.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.800]   Now, the apostle regards this as desperately dangerous, and it is in order to demolish
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.120]   such teaching that he writes this chapter and brings in his own case, because, as he
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.560]   points out, it is a case that is very germane to this whole argument.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.200]   He says, "If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.440]   I more."
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.400]   If that is the teaching, he says, "Well, I would never have become a Christian at all,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.520]   because if those are the standards, being a Jew, being a man who is Hebrew of the Hebrews
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.120]   of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin and so on, and Pharisee, well, if that is
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.600]   it, if that is what makes a man a Christian," says Paul, "well, I was already a Christian,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.520]   and he could never have selected a more powerful argument."
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.960]   His own case, his own story, is more than sufficient, once and forever, to destroy that
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   false teaching.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.920]   But, as we have seen, in doing that, the apostle gives us a most amazing exposition of what
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.120]   indeed it does mean to be a Christian, and it is for that reason that I am calling your
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.360]   attention to it.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.040]   The apostle's anxiety is such that he says that he is going to write to them the same
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.200]   things, the things he has written before.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.600]   He says to write the same things to you, "To me, indeed, is not grievous, but for you it
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.120]   is safe."
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.260]   He means this.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.760]   If we are wrong about this question of what it is that makes a man a Christian, well,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.160]   then we are altogether wrong.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.520]   There is only one way of salvation.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.320]   It is that which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.800]   That is the whole case of the New Testament.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.020]   Most unpopular today, I know.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.820]   We are living in times when people say, "Well, something in Hinduism, after all, something
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.820]   in Mohammedanism."
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.960]   It is a different way of looking at it.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.640]   We all get there in the end, to the same place, many ways of climbing the mountain, many doors
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.360]   of entry into this great palace, to which the Bible says, "No, there is none other
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:24.440]   name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, save this of the Lord Jesus
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.520]   Christ."
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.400]   All other religions are false religions.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   This is Christianity.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   This is the Christian message.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.360]   That is why the apostle says, "It is safe.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.440]   I must remind you of this."
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.600]   You start compromising on this, he says, or diluting this, or adding to it, you have
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   destroyed it.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.320]   And the result is, you are lost, you have no salvation.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.920]   You have no hope.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:56.520]   So he says that he does this because, as I say, it is the only safe thing for them.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.320]   And I say once more that in my own feeble manner, I am trying to emulate and imitate
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.760]   the example of this great apostle.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.080]   My dear friends, I am in this pulpit because this message is the only way of safety at
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   this hour.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.520]   And if ever people should be concerned about that, it is now.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.800]   Our whole world is in such a strange condition of uncertainty and insecurity.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.000]   Who knows what tomorrow is going to bring forth?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.080]   Who knows what will emerge at any moment?
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   Again we are reminded today of how easily, quickly, and unexpectedly people can pass
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.360]   from life to death and time to eternity.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.640]   My friends, the whole object of preaching this gospel is this, to ask men and women,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.920]   "Are you prepared for death?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.960]   Are you ready to die?
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.280]   Do you know how to die?
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.800]   How do you face eternity?
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   How do you face God?"
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.520]   That is the question.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.400]   You see, because the whole message is this, that death is not the end.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.660]   Death in many ways is just a beginning.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.280]   This is the unreal world, this one that we are in now.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.960]   There is a great life, there is a great world beyond this, and it goes on forever and forever
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   and forever.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   That is the one that matters.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.640]   And as we go out of this world, we all will have to stand before God in the judgment and
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.440]   give an account of ourselves, what we have done with our souls.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.080]   Have we lived to the glory of God?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.120]   We will all have to give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.600]   It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.440]   Now I say there is only one way of safety, it is this gospel.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.480]   And that is why we must face it.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.720]   More, that is why we must be sure about it.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   That is why we must be certain about it.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.600]   Well very well, the apostle tells us.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.320]   To be a Christian, he says, is this, it is to worship God in the Spirit, to rejoice in
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.760]   Christ Jesus, and to have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   We have also seen how we become Christians in that way.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.320]   It is to be apprehended, to be arrested by Christ.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.640]   Paul was taken hold of on the road to Damascus.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.320]   Christ laid his hand upon him.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.800]   He arrested him, he charged him.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.240]   And he was convicted, and yielded himself willingly and readily.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.760]   Then he has gone on to tell us what happens to a man when he does thus become a Christian.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.160]   And we are interested in this for this reason.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.720]   That as you look at the statements made by the apostle of the inevitable consequences
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   or corollaries, if you like, of becoming a Christian, you have a very wonderful test
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.920]   which you can apply to yourself and ask yourself the question, well is that true of me?
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.440]   In other words, I am doing two things tonight, as I have been trying to do on the previous
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.320]   occasions.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.480]   I am not only making a positive statement of the gospel in the hope and in the trust
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.000]   that under the power of the Holy Spirit someone who is not a Christian may be convinced and
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   convicted of sin and become a Christian.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   I am also anxious to test those who claim to be Christian.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.320]   Because there have been many in the world who thought they were Christians.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.520]   These people did.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.040]   The apostle says they are not.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.760]   There were many such in New Testament times that have been ever since.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.240]   There is a possibility of people complacently imagining that they are Christians and will
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.680]   discover one day, perhaps when it is too late, that they have never been Christians at all.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.480]   I mean the people who think that to be a Christian is to live a good life and not to do any harm
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   and to go to church occasionally.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.640]   Well, they are in the most hopeless condition imaginable.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:52.240]   And as I am concerned on this question of safety, I am addressing such people also.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.080]   We cannot afford to take risks at a time like this.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.800]   We must be sure of where we stand.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.160]   Well now then, he has been telling us what happens, he says, is this when a man becomes
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.880]   a Christian.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.840]   He suddenly finds that his whole world is turned upside down.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.880]   He begins to think, he begins to count, to calculate, to assess.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   What does he find?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.000]   Well, he finds he has been living in a fool's paradise.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.840]   He finds he has been fooling himself, deluding himself, misleading himself.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.680]   He finds that he has been preparing a false balance sheet for life.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.960]   Those things which were gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   Completely the opposite.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   That is what he found.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   Then we went on last Sunday to see that he adds even to that, "Yea, doubtless," he says,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.040]   in that extraordinary statement of his.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.600]   I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.360]   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.840]   In other words, what we have seen so far can be put like this.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:07.480]   Once a man becomes a Christian, he finds that he has got an entirely different view of everything
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.040]   else.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.520]   But now tonight I want to take it a step further.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.080]   He also finds that he has got an entirely different view of himself.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.560]   All other things, I do count them all but loss.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.320]   Those are the other things, the things to which he had attached great significance,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.840]   the things which he had prized and valued so highly.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.760]   All those, he says, I see now are loss, refuse, dung, utterly worthless, useless, a manure
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.480]   heap, the things that have stood between me and belief in Christ.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   He says, I hate them, the things which he so admired and so coveted.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.640]   These were the very things that had robbed him of the blessings that now have come to
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.120]   him in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.280]   But now he turns to himself.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.960]   He has got an entirely different view of himself.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.560]   Everything has been changed.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.360]   And now therefore he proceeds to tell us how he wants to see himself and how he wants others
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   to see him.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.240]   Here is an interesting phrase.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.640]   He says that I may win Christ and be found, be found in him.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   What he means is this.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.520]   That is how I want people to find me, he says.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.440]   When people look at me now, he says, this is what I want them to see.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.680]   That is what he means by and be found in him.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   Well now then, what does he tell us about himself?
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.120]   What is it that a man can now say about himself?
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.360]   What can others find in him because he is a Christian?
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   Let us look at them.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.440]   There are three main statements made here.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.320]   A Christian is a man who wants to win Christ.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   And do count them but done that I may win Christ.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.360]   Here is the phrase.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.720]   What does he mean by this?
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.480]   Well now, let us put it like this.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.400]   Do you notice the way he keeps on repeating the name of our Lord?
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.080]   What things were gained to me?
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   Those I count at loss for Christ.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.600]   Yea doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.680]   Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but done
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.680]   that I may win Christ and be found in him, not having my known righteousness which is
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.280]   of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.600]   by faith.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.920]   You notice the repetition of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:46.880]   So frequently in that short space and that gives us the key to the whole matter.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:54.480]   A Christian is a man to whom the Lord Jesus Christ is absolutely central.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.000]   Christ?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.320]   Christ is the central object of the Christian's ambition that I may win Christ?
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.120]   He's the goal of his life.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.880]   He is his greatest interest.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.360]   He is his greatest concern.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:19.200]   Now here is something that the apostle makes not only abundantly clear here but everywhere
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.120]   in all his writings.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.840]   Something I say that is of supreme importance for us if we want to be quite sure that we
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   are Christians.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.000]   This is the result of becoming Christian.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Christ becomes central to win Christ.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.840]   That's my ambition, that's my object, that's the thing that comes before everything else
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.960]   he says in my life.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.440]   But what I want to emphasize is this.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   He means the person of Christ himself.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.280]   This is the thing he emphasizes.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.800]   You notice that he doesn't say that I may win Christianity.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.280]   The apostle doesn't talk about Christianity, he talks about Christ.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.120]   He's not concerned primarily about a teaching or about an attitude.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.960]   No, I'm taking this up and I'm emphasizing this because I verily believe that this is
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:18.200]   the single greatest danger confronting all church members everywhere in the world at
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.320]   this present moment.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.100]   It is to be interested in Christianity and not in Christ.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.800]   It is to be interested in Christian teaching, Christian application of truth, Christian
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.860]   attitudes, and not to know the person.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.640]   It is the greatest danger of all.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.160]   I could dilate on this, I mustn't do so this evening, but there is a very popular
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.440]   teaching on the continent of Europe at the present time.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:55.040]   It is possibly the most popular theological school of teaching at this very moment on
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:02.320]   the continent of Europe, which says this, that the facts concerning the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.560]   do not matter at all.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.400]   It's the teaching that matters.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.760]   And all we are told here is only a valewing that it brings us to some kind of experience,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:19.360]   some kind of religious experience, as to whether he was born of the virgin doesn't matter,
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.080]   whether he worked a miracle doesn't matter.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.400]   Indeed, the teaching says he never did, that he wasn't born of a virgin, that he never
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.680]   worked a miracle, that his death is not an atoning death, he never rose from the grave,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.920]   and so on, but it doesn't matter.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.220]   Now, that is the most popular theological teaching in the Christian church on the continent
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.480]   of Europe at the present time.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.160]   That's why I'm emphasizing this.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:48.440]   Oh, how different it is from the teaching of the apostle.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.080]   I don't care what your Christian view of this, that, and the other is.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.760]   I'm asking, what's your relationship to him?
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   Where does he come in?
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.960]   Now, this is quite amazing.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.840]   There are movements in this country that call themselves Christian and pass as Christian,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.120]   issue books as Christians, have great propaganda as Christians, and yet you can read some of
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.360]   their books and you will literally not find the name of the Lord Jesus Christ mentioned
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   once.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.720]   Well, I have only one comment.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.280]   That is not Christianity.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.400]   It can be good moral teaching, but it's not Christian teaching.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:35.160]   You can't have anything here unless he himself, the person, is absolutely essential and central
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.680]   in the beginning and the end, always, everywhere.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.920]   Christ himself.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:49.800]   That I may win Christ, not a Christian philosophy, not a Christian attitude, but Christ himself,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   the historic person.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.600]   Well, of course, it's not surprising that the apostle should say this, is it?
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:02.400]   You see, this man's entire life was changed by meeting the person, not a teaching.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.000]   He'd met the teaching before and dismissed it as blasphemy and would have nothing at
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.160]   all to do with it.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.000]   What changed this man's life right round was the meeting with the person himself.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.360]   So to him, everything concerning the person is of vital importance and of vital significance.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.320]   And I want to emphasize that this evening.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.240]   There is no Christianity apart from Christ.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.360]   There is no Christianity apart from the historic facts and events in connection with this person.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.560]   This is not a teaching.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.520]   It is not a philosophy.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.800]   This is a declaration of what God has done in time about us men and our salvation.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.440]   And the facts are absolutely essential.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.160]   Here is the Christian message.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.920]   In the fullness of the times, when the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.680]   son made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.560]   He was born in Bethlehem in a stable, put into a manger.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   That's a fact.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.960]   This is the thing on which my whole position depends, that the word was made flesh and
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.480]   dwelt among us and proved that he was the son of God by his miracles, by his teaching,
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.920]   by everything that he did.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.400]   All the facts are essential.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.360]   He died literally upon a cross.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.640]   He was buried in a grave.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.080]   He literally rose in the body, out of the grave, manifested himself for forty days to
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   certain chosen witnesses and ascended in their presence into heaven and there took his seat
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.440]   at the right hand of God in the glory.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:42.520]   That's what the apostle is talking about, this person and what this person has done,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.600]   what this person has achieved.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:54.760]   Now you see the thing that matters therefore is this, is the fact of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.760]   himself.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.960]   Everything has changed for this man because the Son of God came, has come into the world
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   and has done all this and has gone back into the glory.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   That's everything.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:12.560]   And what he wants is to know this and to understand this and to be influenced by this even more
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.000]   than he is at the present time.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.520]   Now, he tells us that this is everything to him.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.200]   He's got nothing apart from Christ.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   In writing to the Corinthians he says, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.600]   unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, Christ the person.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   He's made all that.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.360]   What more do you want?
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.320]   You want wisdom?
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.400]   You want understanding of life and its attendant circumstances and its problems and its prospects?
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.040]   You'll never get it anywhere, he says, except in Christ.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.920]   He's everything, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.120]   Christ, he says, what is he?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.640]   He says he's the beginning, he's also the end, he's the Alpha, he's the Omega.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.520]   Then he says in a great phrase, "He's all and in all."
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.320]   There's nothing else.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.440]   Oh, what's the phrase a man once used?
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.560]   It's so perfectly true.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:18.600]   The Apostle Paul is a Christ-intoxicated man.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.440]   Christ is everything, that I may win Christ.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   This is what he wants.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.400]   He's already said it in a most amazing way in the first chapter of this epistle to the
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.680]   Philippians.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:34.760]   In one of the most astounding things he ever said, he said this, "To me, for to me to live,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   is Christ."
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.600]   That's what I mean by living, says Paul, it's Christ.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.080]   Now, my friends, what's our view of life?
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   What's living to us?
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.040]   To me, says Paul, to live is Christ.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   What is to live to us?
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.240]   What if you were asked for your definition of what living means?
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.880]   What is living to you?
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.040]   What does living mean to men in this modern world?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.900]   It means money to so many.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.900]   It means pleasure.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.180]   It means drink.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.180]   It means position.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.600]   It means a thousand and one things.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.040]   That's real life, they said.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.000]   Most people have turned their backs in places of worship because they want life, real life.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.880]   That's their view of life, you see.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.440]   To live is to do these things.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.640]   Now, says Paul, to me to live is Christ.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.400]   It isn't life without him, but with him it is.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.600]   It's life and life more abundantly.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.700]   And his view of death is exactly the same.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.520]   To me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   Why?
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520]   Well, for this reason.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:41.640]   He says, "I am a straight patrich too, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ."
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.960]   What's heaven to the apostle Paul?
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.480]   Well, that's what it is.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.280]   Heaven is to be with Christ.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.000]   He doesn't think so much in terms of golden streets and great gifts and blessings.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.480]   Oh, it's just to be with him, to see him as he is with unclouded eye, to look into
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.920]   his face, to spend my eternity with him.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:08.480]   To me to live is Christ, to die is to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:15.640]   My dear friends, does he hold that position in your life and in your esteem and in your
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.880]   thinking?
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.040]   Is he absolutely essential to you?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.760]   Do you feel you can't go on without him?
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.940]   Has he changed everything for you?
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.680]   Is he at the center and entirely the circumference at the same time?
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.920]   Is he the beginning and the end?
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   Is he everything?
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   Is he all and being all?
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   Where does he come in?
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:42.400]   Oh, I plead with you, contemplate this question most earnestly and most seriously.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.200]   It is the person himself that matters.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:56.120]   To Paul this is the great ambition, to win Christ, who is already all and being all to
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   him.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.560]   But let me go on to the second point, which is this.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:05.640]   The second thing he says is that he wants to be found in Christ, that I may win Christ
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   and be found in him.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.600]   Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.080]   faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.840]   Now here again is a tremendous and a glorious statement.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:30.280]   God give me strength and ability to put it before you in such clarity that we may feel
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.680]   something of what this great man felt when he wrote these words or dictated them to some
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.120]   of the many wincers.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.180]   Let's try and get hold of them.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.180]   This is glorious.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.360]   Use all your ability, my friend.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.720]   Ask the Spirit of God to enable you to concentrate.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   It's not easy.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   It's such glorious doctrine.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   It isn't easy.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.160]   It isn't this kind of stuff that you get on your television or you get in your novelettes
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   or anywhere else.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   You've got to think about this.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.160]   It's glorious doctrine.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   But oh, how wonderful.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.800]   Let's try and lay hold upon this, that I may be found in him, he says.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   What does he mean?
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.720]   Well, you see, this is his view of the Christian life.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   What is a Christian?
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.000]   How would we answer that question, I wonder?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   What's a Christian?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.760]   Ah, you see, a Christian is a man who has had forgiveness.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.000]   Quite right, but you know, that's a very poor definition.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.840]   A Christian is a man who has had various blessings.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.520]   All right, I'll agree, but you know, that isn't really the way to define what a Christian
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   is.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.600]   In the New Testament, the favorite way of describing a Christian is two words, "in
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.280]   Christ."
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.840]   You look at it as you read your New Testament.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.000]   In Christ.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.180]   That's the Christian.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.760]   You see, everything in the Christian life is related to him.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   The whole is related.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   The parts are related.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.960]   What does he mean by this phrase, "in Christ"?
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.720]   Now, he says, "This is how I want to be found."
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:01.080]   He's used this same expression in the second chapter in describing our Lord himself and
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.320]   his incarnation and so on.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.600]   You remember how he puts it, "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.360]   of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men."
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:21.160]   And being found, being found in fashion as a man, that's how he was found to be.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.600]   When people came and looked at him, they saw a man, in fashion as a man, being found, being
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.880]   found as the boy Jesus, being found as the young carpenter.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.440]   People came and that's how they found him.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:39.040]   The Son of God was to be found in the likeness and in the form of a man.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.460]   Now then, says the apostle, "That's how I want to be found, so that when people come
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.440]   and examine me, what shall they find?"
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.840]   Oh, the answer is they'll find someone who is in Christ.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.080]   But what does it mean?
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.800]   Well let me try it like this.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.520]   You see it means that he's living an entirely new kind of life.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.840]   We can never repeat this too often, to become a Christian is the biggest and the profoundest
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.080]   change that one can ever know.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.360]   To pass from not being a Christian to becoming a Christian is the greatest revolution conceivable.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.680]   There's nothing as great as it.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.520]   It's an entirely new life.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.200]   How do you mean, says Emmanuel?
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.640]   I'll tell you as he tells us here.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:32.440]   You see, until a man becomes a Christian, his life is based entirely upon himself.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.480]   What I think, what I do, what I like, what I desire.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.200]   Entirely selfish, isn't it?
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.360]   We all know that.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.560]   The life of the natural man is intensely selfish.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.200]   All revolves around himself.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, a great change takes place.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.760]   And the change is that he is no longer basing his life upon himself at all.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.800]   Not even his best.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.320]   His best thoughts, his best activities, all that he says is lost, be found in him not
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.840]   having mine own righteousness, which is of the law.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.520]   That's what it used to be, you see.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.920]   His good life, his religious life, his moral life, and all the rest of it, he was very
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.480]   proud of it and he lived on it.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.240]   But he says, I've finished with it, that's got nothing to do with me now.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   The life I have now, he says, has got nothing to do with me and my own activities.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.840]   Not mine own, it's this other one, this thing that is in Christ.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.960]   So he puts it like this.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:41.460]   The Christian's life is based entirely upon his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:46.680]   Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but the righteousness which is
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.960]   by faith or through the faith of Christ.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.560]   The righteousness which is of God, by faith.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.060]   Now that's the thing.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.760]   So I put it simply in this form.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.520]   Until a man becomes a Christian, he has faith in himself.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.400]   The moment a man becomes a Christian, he has faith in Christ.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   That's the difference.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.840]   The whole basis is different.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.320]   He's finished with that old life of self-dependence.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.980]   He is entirely, utterly dependent upon the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.200]   This is a Christian.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:25.360]   A man whose whole position tonight depends upon what he has believed concerning the truth
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.120]   of God in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.200]   Now I'm making a big statement there, but it is the Christian statement.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:42.280]   A Christian is a man whose whole view of everything is entirely dependent upon his acceptance
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:49.640]   and belief of this message concerning the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:56.360]   A Christian's whole life is based upon this faith of his in him.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.300]   But let me try it in another way.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:06.360]   He is a man in Christ, that I may be found in him.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   What does he mean by that?
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.520]   Well, those of you who know your Pauline epistles know exactly what he means.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:18.040]   And there's nothing that I know of more wonderful in the world than this particular teaching.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.400]   What does he mean by saying that he wants to be found in Christ?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.440]   Let me try and give you a very brief summary of what he means by that.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.680]   He stated it very fully in the epistle to the Romans in chapter 5 from verse 12 to verse
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   21.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.560]   Let me summarize it.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.120]   We've had it also in that second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians that I read to
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.560]   you at the beginning, and I read it deliberately because it is a wonderful exposition of just
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.520]   this very thing.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520]   What is it?
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.120]   Well, look at it like this.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:56.400]   Every one of us born into this world is in Adam.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:03.280]   Adam, the first man, our first father.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.920]   We've all come out of Adam, so we're all in Adam.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.080]   That means that we've inherited our life from him.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.040]   We've inherited everything from him.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.720]   Adam sinned, Adam fell, Adam was punished very well.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.320]   We are his offspring, we are his progeny.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:24.160]   Adam by falling lost his perfection, he became imperfect, his nature became sinful, his nature
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.080]   became twisted and perverted.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.880]   We are all born in Adam, like father, like son.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.680]   In other words, we're all born sinners.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.780]   If you dispute that, you're not a Christian.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.040]   If you don't admit that you were born a sinner, you can't see any need of salvation.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.280]   We are all born in sin.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.000]   We were all, says Paul, the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.240]   That's because, you see, we are all in Adam.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.680]   Adam sinned and we all sinned with him.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.520]   It was a corporate representative act, and we're all involved in that action.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.200]   The sin of Adam and the consequences of that sin have come down upon us all.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:13.420]   That's why every child is a rebel and always wants to do the thing he's told not to do.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.680]   That's why we all like evil and sin and are ready to read such things and to follow them
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.400]   and to listen to anybody who whispers things into our ears.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   When we are adolescents, we all enjoy it and gloat in it.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.160]   All this bias towards evil and wrong and sin is the result of our being in Adam.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.800]   We're all reaping the consequences of the fall of Adam.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.240]   As Paul says, "I was like that once."
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.920]   Like everybody else, we were all the children of wrath, even as others, in Adam, and lost
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.320]   in Adam, and sinful in Adam, and hopeless in Adam.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.240]   Now then, here's the Christian message.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.520]   God sent his Son into this world.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.320]   The Lord of glory became Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.800]   What for?
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:04.880]   To start a new humanity, to start a new race of people.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:11.040]   The race that was in Adam fell and is doomed and damned, is fallen and sinful.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.800]   There's only one way of saving us, and that is to start a new race, and that we belong
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   to the new race.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   Here he is.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.920]   Who is Jesus Christ?
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:25.520]   He is the second man, the last Adam.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:32.040]   There are only two big representative men, Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.280]   Adam is the first man, the Lord Jesus Christ is the second man.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.600]   Adam is the first Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ is the last Adam.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   There'll never be another.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.960]   Here is the only other.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.200]   Here is the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.120]   Here is the beginner of a new progeny.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.440]   Here is the first leader of a new humanity.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.560]   That's what he means.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.760]   He says, "I'm no longer in Adam, I'm in Christ now."
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.200]   He belongs to Christ.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.520]   He's joined to Christ, and all the benefits that he's enjoying are the result of this,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.080]   his union with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   What does it mean?
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.360]   Now then, let me just note them for you.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.360]   Here is the wonderful teaching.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.000]   This is Christian salvation.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.800]   And you see why everything that happened to the historic person is of such vital importance.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.920]   He's my representative, and what he did, he did for me.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.320]   And when he did it, I was doing it in him, because he is my representative.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.000]   If I'm in him, well, what he does, I do.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.160]   That's the Christian teaching.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   What has he done?
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:39.800]   Well, he was crucified, and he died upon the cross, and he was buried in a grave.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.400]   Why did he die upon the cross?
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.440]   Well, the answer is, he was dying to the law of God.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:53.200]   You see, God's law pronounces its judgment upon sin, and it condemns sin, and it punishes
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.920]   sin, and the punishment of sin is death.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.880]   Very well, why did he die?
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   He never sinned.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.920]   So, the answer is that he was dying for us.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.520]   He was bearing the punishment of sin meted out by the law.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.560]   He was bearing the penalty of the law against sin.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.840]   That's what he was doing.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.440]   But the wonderful teaching is this.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.600]   If I'm in him, when he died, I died.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:25.800]   So the apostle says, I have been crucified with Christ, because I'm in him.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.720]   It isn't only he who died, I died with him.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:33.640]   I have died to the demands of the law upon me, to the condemnation of the law.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.880]   Did you notice how Paul put that in writing to the Ephesians?
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:45.760]   But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.440]   dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, and hath raised us up together.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   That's it.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.280]   You'll find it in all Paul's epistles.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:35:01.480]   He puts it there in Romans 6, knowing that our old man was crucified with Christ.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.840]   How shall we that have died to sin continue any longer therein?
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.920]   Here it is.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.680]   If I'm in Christ, what's happened to him has happened to me.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.300]   He's died, he's borne the punishment of sin, so I have.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:17.040]   So Paul says that I may be found in him, not having my known righteousness which is of
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.120]   the law, and which I've already seen to be worthless and useless.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.920]   No, no, but that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, through faith in Christ,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.640]   the righteousness of God which is in him.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.760]   Very well, but wait a minute.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.600]   That's only the first step.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.760]   Because I'm in him when he died, I died.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.520]   But thank God I've also risen with him.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.000]   He rose again.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.320]   He came out from among the dead and he has risen.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.080]   So have I.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.560]   He's ascended into the presence of God and he's seated at the right hand of God.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.680]   If I'm in Christ, all this has happened to me.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.760]   Hereth he quicken and hath raised us up together with Christ.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.760]   What's it mean?
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.680]   Well, I can put it like this.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:11.280]   He stands in the presence of God in all the perfection of his holiness and his righteousness.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.200]   And if I am in him, I also stand in the same righteousness.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   That's what it means.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.280]   I've risen with him.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.880]   I am reconciled to God.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:28.400]   I am standing in the presence of God, clothed with the robe of the righteousness of Christ.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.880]   He never sinned, but that righteousness is given to me, not my known righteousness which
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.440]   is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.000]   from God, by faith.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.560]   It means this, that when I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, I become a part of him
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.360]   and I've died with him, I've been crucified, I've been buried, but I've risen.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.320]   And as he stands before God, so do I.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.080]   In him, God doesn't see me, he sees me in him.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   I'm clothed with the righteousness of Christ.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:04.920]   Which means, you see, that I have got access into the presence of God.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:10.000]   That I, who used to try and pray and wonder whether God was really accepting me or not
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.160]   or listening to me or not, now know that I am accepted because I am in the beloved.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.360]   I go in Christ.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.320]   By him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.120]   It isn't in myself, it's in Christ.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.680]   God's my Father, I'm reconciled to him, my sins are forgiven, I can pray.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.160]   Listen to Paul again, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:43.320]   Christ, by whom also we have access into this grace wherein we stand.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.000]   My friends, do you realize what it means to be in Christ?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.760]   Do you begin to understand why Paul is so excited?
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.520]   He wants to be found in him, not having his own righteousness, but this righteousness
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.720]   which is of God, by faith.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.280]   A Christian is a man who is alive unto God because he is in Christ and he can look into
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.840]   the face of God and pray and know he is praying to his Father and that God will hear him and
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.840]   bless him.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.560]   Do you know what it means?
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:18.040]   And it means this, that he is partaking of the life of Christ, in Christ, be found in
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.720]   him, joined to him, as a limb is a part of the body, as my hand is in me.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.160]   So the Christian is in Christ.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.920]   Listen to the apostle putting it to the Galatians.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.880]   I am crucified with Christ.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:47.160]   Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:54.040]   In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.480]   and who gave himself for me.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   You see, the whole life of the Christian is governed by this relationship to Christ, of
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.680]   being in Christ.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.620]   Because he is in Christ, his past is blotted out and forgiven.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:15.240]   Because he is in Christ, he is living his present life by the power of Christ who is
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.520]   in him, not by himself, not by his own energy, not by his own righteousness.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.680]   Listen to John saying it, "Of his fullness of all we received and grace for grace."
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.000]   It's like a plant, you see, that won't grow, being grafted into a powerful plant, and it
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.320]   begins to grow and to bear fruit.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.960]   It's like a man dying of thirst, suddenly given drink, linked to a fountain, a well
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.620]   put in him, bubbling up into everlasting life.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   This is it.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.960]   "We drink of thee, the fountainhead."
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   What does it all mean?
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.520]   Well, if you like, let me call it a new birth.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   Being found in Christ means that a man is born again, as an entirely new life, a new
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.480]   nature, a new heart, a new beginning, new powers, new opportunity.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.440]   Everything in his present life is lived by the faith of the Son of God who loved him
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.160]   and gave himself for him.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.280]   And in the same way, his entire hope of the future is in Christ, seated with him in the
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.200]   heavenly places, in Christ Jesus.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.240]   Here at the end of this chapter, our conversation is in him, from whence also we look for the
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.040]   Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.040]   What is a Christian?
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.520]   He's a citizen of heaven.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.000]   He's a stranger here.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.560]   He's a colonist here.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.080]   There's his home in the New Jerusalem.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.240]   He's in Christ, and Christ is there, and he's merely a stranger here for a while.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.560]   There is the place he belongs.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.080]   So that when you talk about your bums and the world being blown to nothing, it doesn't
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.480]   affect me as a Christian.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.200]   I belong there, and nothing can touch that.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.480]   Here's his argument.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.560]   It's all because he is in Christ.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:00.840]   He wants to be found in him, not having his own righteousness which is of the Lord, but
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:10.080]   the righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.480]   And this obviously leads to the last thing which I merely mention.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.400]   Christian is a man who wants to win Christ.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:29.920]   Christian is a man who is in Christ, and he's a man who wants to serve Christ.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.600]   "Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but lust for the excellency of the knowledge of
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:43.640]   Christ Jesus, my Lord, my Lord."
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   What's he mean?
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   He says, "I'm nothing but a slave.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:54.480]   The one who took hold of me has arrested me, and ever since I'm in his hands I live only
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.680]   as he would have me live, my Lord."
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.360]   What the master was to the slave, Christ is to me, he says.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.560]   I'm no longer my own.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.480]   I've been bought out of the market.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.920]   I was a slave of sin.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.200]   I was a slave of the devil.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.040]   I was a slave of the world, and I couldn't get free.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.600]   He came and by the cost of price of his own blood, he bought me out.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.640]   You're no longer your own.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.000]   You're bought with a price.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.200]   You've got no right to sin, says Paul to the Corinthians.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.360]   You're not your own masters.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.720]   You've been bought by the precious blood of Christ.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   He is your owner.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   You're the slave.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.840]   Paul's favorite designation of himself is this.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:40.640]   Paul, the servant, which means the bond slave, the bond slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.600]   Oh, it's inevitable, isn't it?
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.840]   If you really believe that the Son of God came from heaven to earth and even went to
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.800]   the death on the cross and to a grave in order to save you, in order to reconcile you to
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.600]   God, in order to make you a child of God, to save you from hell and destruction, if
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:04.040]   you really believe that, my friend, the logic is inevitable.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.320]   You must say, "I've no right to myself.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   He's my Lord.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   He's my master.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.080]   I'm nothing but a slave to him, and I'm a happy slave and a glad slave.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   Love so amazing, so divine, demands it.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.920]   My soul, my life, my all."
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:21.920]   What's a Christian?
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.280]   He's a man whose life is controlled by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.240]   His thoughts.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.400]   He thinks after Christ.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   That's how the Christian thinks.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.680]   He doesn't think like other people think.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.880]   He doesn't view life tonight and its attendant circumstances and prospects as anybody else
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   does.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.160]   What's the world living for?
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   What's it thinking tonight?
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.640]   What's it interested in?
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   What's its outlook?
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.280]   Well, we know what it is, don't we?
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.400]   What's the outlook of a Christian?
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:55.560]   Entirely governed by Christ.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.200]   And it's a teaching which tells me that my life in this world is but a pilgrimage and
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:08.840]   a journey, that this isn't the real world, that that's the one that's going to come.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.040]   And that this is a sinful and an evil world.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.600]   I mustn't have my prospects in this.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.760]   I mustn't get excited about this or be enthused by this.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.640]   I think as Christ thought, and we know how he thought.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   He was in it but not of it.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.080]   He walked through it.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.960]   And you and I must live the same life.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.120]   All our thinking must be governed by him.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.760]   Your political thinking, your social thinking, your every type of thinking must be governed
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   by him.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.400]   Likewise, our feelings.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.280]   The Christian is a man who says, "Let nothing please nor pain me apart, O Lord, from Thee."
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:45.040]   A Christian is a man whose will is governed by that of Christ.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:53.280]   "My Lord, let nothing please nor pain me apart, O Lord, from Thee.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.680]   Only to do Thy will, my will shall be."
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.680]   That's what he's saying.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   "My Lord."
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   Let me close by quoting to you the words of Augustus, top lady who expresses this so perfectly.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:22.760]   "Object of my first desire, Jesus, crucified for me, all to happiness aspire only to be
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.720]   found in Thee."
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.240]   This is the Christian confession.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.560]   Look at it all again.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.320]   Can you appropriate these words of the great apostle?
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:43.200]   Can you appropriate similar words written so many centuries afterwards by Charles Wesley?
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.560]   All who claim the name of Christ tonight face this challenge.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:46:05.680]   Do you say honestly, "Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in Thee I find."
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   Can you say that?
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:16.520]   "Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in Thee I find.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:22.440]   Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, lead the blind."
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.800]   Can you say that?
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:32.440]   Can you go on and say this, "Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.440]   sin.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:39.520]   Let the healing streams abound, make me, keep me pure within.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:49.000]   Thou of life, the fountain of life, freely let me take of Thee.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:59.400]   Spring Thou up within my heart, rise to all eternity."
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.360]   Is he that to us, my friend?
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.160]   How can we be Christians unless in some measure that is true of us?
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.400]   We can say that honestly.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.880]   It is the person that matters.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.520]   And the Christian is a man who having had a glimpse of himself, my supreme desire is
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:30.800]   that I may win him, that I may be found in him, that I may be his bond slave and live
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:39.640]   to his glory and to his praise while I am left in this sinful world of time.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:46.760]   Oh, my dear friends, make sure that you know him.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:53.800]   Make sure that your life is based upon faith in him, nothing else at all, nothing of yourself,
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:00.920]   nothing of the world, entirely, utterly only faith in him.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:06.280]   I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:14.080]   And the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:19.480]   and who gave himself for me.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:25.760]   My Lord, your personal relationship to him, do you know him as such?
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.280]   Are you relying upon him and upon him only as such?
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.920]   If there is any doubt about it, fly to him, cast yourself upon his love and mercy, ask
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.280]   him to reveal and manifest himself to you, plead with him, don't give yourself rest
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:49.440]   nor peace until you can say, "My Lord and my God."
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.360]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
