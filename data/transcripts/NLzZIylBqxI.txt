[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   Pastor John, there's an interesting pair of passages in the book of Ecclesiastes, specifically
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.760]   Ecclesiastes 519 and 6-2.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.760]   In those passages, we're told that God is not only the source of material possessions,
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.480]   but He's also the source of the power to enjoy those material possessions if He gives it.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.040]   So what do you think this means?
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.920]   How much of delight in creation is a gift from God?
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.760]   Here's the short answer.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:44.200]   Yes, we should pray for the ability to rightly enjoy what God has given us to enjoy.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:55.560]   And all of truly God-honoring delight in creation is a miraculous gift of God.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.920]   There is much non-God-honoring delight in creation that's not a miraculous gift of God's
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.760]   grace.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.680]   But if any of us delights in creation at all with a heart for God that sees Him as the
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.360]   maker and sees the gift as a taste of the giver, that delight is a gift of grace.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.640]   And none of us came up with it from our fallen selves.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.280]   So that's my short answer.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.400]   Yes.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.180]   But to the question, what does Ecclesiastes 519 and 6-2 mean, we got to read them.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.400]   So let me read them and then just make a brief comment.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.120]   So here's 519.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.640]   Everyone to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them and to
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.200]   accept His lot and rejoice in His toil, this is a gift of God.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.760]   So yes, the gift of possessions and the power to enjoy them is a gift of God.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.160]   Now here's 6-1 and 2.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.640]   There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.400]   A man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:28.360]   he desires, yet God does not give him the power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   them.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.720]   This is vanity and a grievous evil, or a sore affliction, be another translation.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660]   Now just a word about Ecclesiastes.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.540]   Almost everyone agrees, however you interpret this book, almost everyone agrees that one
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.260]   way or the other, the book of Ecclesiastes is meant to expose the emptiness and futility
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:03.240]   and frustration and final misery of life without God, or as he calls it, life under the sun.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.520]   But the writer has a profound view of God's sovereignty and a profound view of God's total
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.440]   involvement in creation, and that we will all give an account someday so that the last
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.000]   verses of the book are, "The end of the matter, all has been heard.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.640]   Fear God, keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.060]   For God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether good or evil."
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:42.420]   So the person who asked this question notices rightly that two things are owing to God.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.940]   One, the measure of wealth that anyone has in all his possessions.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.620]   Yes, the providence of God governs that.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.500]   And two, the power to enjoy it.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.900]   The situation in verse 19, God has given wealth and the power to enjoy them.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.380]   The situation in verse two of chapter six, God has given wealth and no power to enjoy
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380]   it.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.940]   A stranger enjoys it.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.020]   So he's asking, "What does this mean?"
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:20.000]   What this means is that in God's providence, you can miss out on pleasure in more ways
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.460]   than one.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:31.580]   You can be deprived of material things that you want, or you can get them and be deprived
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.140]   of the power to enjoy them because they're snatched away.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.500]   I read the other day, I think this is a perfect illustration of what he's talking about.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.740]   I read the other day of a man and his wife who were building a dream home.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.540]   They dreamed about it, they planned it, they had designed it.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.300]   They moved into a trailer beside it to watch it go up.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.780]   And just when it was finished and they were about to move in, she died of a heart attack.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.180]   That's Ecclesiastes.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.260]   And his purpose in pointing out these miseries, the grievous evils of these sore afflictions,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.540]   as he calls them, is not to make us godless or cynical or hopeless.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:23.700]   His point is to make us despair that meaning and joy can finally be found in this world
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.660]   under the sun.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.100]   That is, as naturalists, as godless.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.060]   One man gets rich and gets the ability to enjoy his riches.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.900]   Another man gets rich and loses his ability to enjoy it.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.220]   And the lesson for both of them is, don't set your heart on riches.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.100]   And so maybe the last thing I should do is read Paul, because Paul just writes like he's
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   read this, right?
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.580]   In 1 Timothy 6, 17, he says, "As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:07.580]   haughty, not to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.160]   us with everything to enjoy.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:17.540]   They are to do good and to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.780]   treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.780]   of that which is truly life."
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.300]   In other words, life with God in the kingdom, not finally life here under the sun.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.560]   I think the writer of Ecclesiastes would say, "Amen."
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.240]   Indeed, amen.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.860]   And the weekend is upon us, and one must never head into the weekend without a great book
