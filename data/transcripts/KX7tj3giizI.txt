[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Can I tell you a funny story? So I was in I was in and then I
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.800]   when I landed, there was an assistant message on the plane.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.480]   And then the pilot text me like, Hey, bad news. We're not going
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.160]   to be able to take you tomorrow. There's an error message. And if
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.400]   we can't resolve it, we can't fly. I said, Okay. So I text
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   sax. I'm like, Hey, dude, I'm in a really tough spot. Is there
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   any way that I you know, I could catch a flight, you know, with
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.800]   you tomorrow? Absolute dead silence. Three hours later, Paul
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.240]   pilot Paul text me and says, Good news. cleared us we're
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.000]   going tomorrow. I text sacks right away. Hey, no worries.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.920]   It's all resolved. In eight seconds. He responds awesome
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   with an exclamation.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.400]   He had zero intention of bringing me and my family with
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.440]   it. Zero.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.040]   I filibustered he filibustered.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.920]   No, the truth is the plane was with me I was using I'd be happy
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.960]   to let you borrow the plane if I'm not using it. Here's sacks
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.440]   the last time we went to dinner ready? The check comes Miller
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.920]   locks lands on the table here sacks. What you're seeing see
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.640]   that? You know what that is? sacks going for his wallet. You
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.280]   can just count it.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.960]   Because I can't remember the last time. He's the last time you
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.960]   picked up a check. J. Cal. What do you every time I pick it up
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.360]   on the way in maybe for a slice of pizza.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.840]   sacks is one of the most generous people I know. I
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680]   remember we went to a bar once we barely had time to get a
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.360]   glass of still water a diet coke and some of the free nuts. And
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.760]   then J. Cal was like guys, it's on me.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.800]   gave it right to the bartender. That's true. My turn. My turn. I
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.040]   got
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.880]   to you got the the white truffles and the flamin young last week.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   I think these bar nuts are on me. It's only fair. Yeah,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   throwing some cashews to throw in the cashews and raisins the
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.840]   trail. I'll get the trail mix. Because you got the truffles
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.720]   last time to month.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:21.760]   All right, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast. We're still
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.280]   here. Episode 105. I don't know if you saw boys last week. The
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.360]   pod hit a new high watermark 16th overall in the world. So
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.040]   congratulations.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.200]   I thought we peaked at 14. Actually, was it 1414 people
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   listen to this pod
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   when I was in DC this week at a bunch of meetings and so many of
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.000]   the of the staffers listen to the pod. And they came up to me
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   they're like, Hey, love you guys listen every week. It's really
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.760]   great. It's really crazy. Actually, the reach of this
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.240]   thing. It's really cool. Now when you're in DC, how gleeful
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.720]   were they about saxes absolute shellacking last week that must
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.600]   have been high fives all over the dams like they won twice.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.520]   Trump announced and sacks lost. Listen, we, we talked a lot of
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.680]   that.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.320]   Are they about SPF and how much money he gave them in order to
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   stop that red wave?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.720]   I talked to a lot of folks, folks. And what I would say is
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.600]   we talked a lot about energy policy, life, life sciences,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.560]   obviously, two areas that I invest a lot of money in, and
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000]   foreign policy. And actually, David, you'd be surprised by how
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   many fans you have there.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.520]   Cool. Well, I mean, like General Milley, like we talked about
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.800]   last week, he's come around Jake Sullivan just this week, said
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.240]   that he told the Ukrainians it was reported that they can't
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.080]   have Crimea back get realistic. So Jake Sullivan and Milley are
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.480]   like the voices of reason now, the administration on this, and
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.640]   they're just saying the same thing I've been saying, for
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.320]   which I was excoriated by the foreign policy establishment.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.600]   And I got into a little Twitter spat with Ian Bremner this week,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   because all of a sudden he posted Oh, everybody has been
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   privately saying that we need to negotiate. No, no, you haven't.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.000]   You were criticizing you were denouncing Elon as a Kremlin
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.280]   agent when he posted that Twitter poll suggesting that
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.680]   the Ukrainians should negotiate. So you were publicly denouncing
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   those of us who are calling for negotiations. And now all of a
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.880]   sudden, you're saying, well, this has always been the
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.920]   position. But I think what's significant about that is the
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.240]   guy is just a weather vane for the blob and the foreign policy
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.920]   establishment. And so the weather vane is now pointing
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.320]   towards negotiation. So that's the good news here.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.840]   Do you think that if DeSantis wins the presidency, you will be
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.960]   nominated as Secretary of State? Treasury? What would you take
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.000]   Treasury? State?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.200]   So if you were offered a cabinet position, would you take you
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.360]   should you should take what you what you have to understand is
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.480]   that my position on foreign policy or Ukraine specifically
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   is not it's not, it's not adopted by either party. I mean,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.920]   McConnell, and the center Republican leadership are very
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.640]   much on board with the Biden administration's policy on this.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.240]   They are very, very hawkish. It's really the unit party on
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.520]   this issue. There's really just one consolidated blob.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.640]   Okay, but back to the question, would you? Would it be a dream
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.840]   of yours? Would you find great joy in having a White House
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.080]   position? DeSantis goes in to serve your country? Would you
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.360]   serve?
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.840]   Would I serve if if if the president of the United States
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.760]   calls you up and asks you to do something, obviously, you have
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.040]   to serve your country, but it's not something I'm looking for.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.360]   That's a yes.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.080]   What if he asked you to serve as the US ambassador to Burkina
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.520]   Faso?
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.200]   Where?
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.880]   The ambassador roles are so funny. It's like you have to
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.040]   compete for the good ones. And then some people get stuck with
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.680]   the bad ones.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.600]   Those are those are available for purchase.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.840]   Yeah, yeah, exactly. You know, there's like, there's like a
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.520]   menu of these things like these ambassadorships. Like, I don't
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.480]   think it's like written down anywhere, but it's kind of like
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   unspoken. It's like if you want the ambassadorship to the UK,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.240]   that's like $10 million. And then, you know, like,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.440]   the thing was, but UK and France, it's every every embassy
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.800]   every ambassadorship comes with an annual budget. But the cost
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.440]   of actually running that embassy and really throwing the parties
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.000]   is much more so for the UK and France. The gap is 10 million a
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.160]   year that you have to fund out of pocket. So you got to be
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.600]   really willing, you know, to put the money up. But apparently I
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.880]   mean, you got to pay for the parties. My friend, my friend
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.560]   was was the ambassador to the UK under Obama, and I went to a
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.320]   party there. It's unbelievable. And he has the best life because
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.360]   like, you know, he was meeting everybody in the world, you can
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.680]   imagine goes through the UK and then wants to meet the US
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   ambassador. It was a great job for him.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.840]   Right. But the money I'm talking about is the cost of buying one
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.960]   of these secures. You have to typically raise that bundle.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.720]   Yeah, you bundle that much money for whoever. This is what I've
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.960]   heard. I mean, I don't know. This is what I've heard is that
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.800]   does that mean that SPF parents if Elizabeth Ward wins the
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.400]   presidency,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.640]   right now the Illuminati right now just revoked all of our
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.640]   Illuminati cards. We're not supposed to talk about this
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.280]   guys, that you can buy an ambassadorship. But speaking of
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.560]   buying politicians and coverage, let's get an update on FT x. So
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.760]   I'm
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.440]   talking about Trump. Speaking of politics, I mean, you know, you
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   bring it up because if I bring it up, I didn't want to tell
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.920]   somebody in the first five minutes, the only thing I want
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.280]   to bring up is, I think I'm entitled to and I told you so on
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.320]   this, there was a story where the FBI said that the reason why
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.240]   Trump kept the boxes in his basement, they've now the FBI
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.600]   has definitively said, it's because he was just trying to
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.880]   preserve mementos, not try to sell state secrets to the
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.120]   Saudis or something like that, like some people were making
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.600]   wild conspiracy theories about so Jake, it looks like I was I
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.040]   was right about that. In fact, I think we had that very
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.120]   discussion on this pod.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.960]   Yeah, I mean, we I said I thought he was keeping it for
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.800]   like keepsakes like mementos. That was my position too,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.160]   because he's
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.880]   a warrior. You didn't support this?
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.600]   Let me ask a question, because I'm gonna put it past him. He's
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.560]   a maniac. I think if you believe that this was about mementos,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.240]   which the FBI is now said it was, I think you also have to
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.160]   say that the FBI's approach and rating his home with armed, you
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.040]   know, soldiers was heavy handed. Now, I'm not saying they didn't
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.200]   have the legal right to do it. I'm sure they checked all the
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.320]   right boxes. But it was heavy handed. But look, that brings me
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.200]   to another point. Why do they do it? I actually suspect now that
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.160]   what the Biden administration is trying to do is keep Trump in
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.720]   the news. I think they actually want to provoke him to run. They
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.080]   want to see exact, it's the exact same thing. Remember the
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.200]   50 million that went into Republican primaries to support
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.440]   the you know, the election denier candidate. Turns out that
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.240]   was a successful strategy for them as much as I hate to admit
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.000]   it as as reckless as I think that was, and hypocritical,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.800]   because I don't think you can be out there claiming that these
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.000]   candidates are a threat to democracy at the very same time
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.600]   you're funding them. So I think it was completely hypocritical
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.360]   and sort of Machiavellian, but it worked. And I think in a
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.720]   similar way, what the democrats are going to try to do over the
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.240]   next year is, is keep Trump in the news as much as possible.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.880]   And in fact, CNN ran his entire speech announcing last Tuesday,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.960]   I think for this reason,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.520]   if Trump wins the Republican nomination, he's going to, then
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.480]   he will lose the presidency. Because if you look at all of
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.000]   these exit polls that came out of these midterms, he's just so
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.960]   massively unfavorable, but that's not what's going to be,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.880]   you know, litigated in the primaries and the primaries,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.240]   it's just Republican on Republican. And there are a
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.520]   non trivial number of paths where Trump actually beats to
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.080]   Santos. And I think that's very scary to the republicans who
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.120]   want to just move on and have a chance of actually consolidating
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.240]   power. And it's gleefully blissful for the democrats.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.680]   Because if again, and we saw this, look, if the democrats
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.520]   weren't able to fund and field MAGA candidates in the
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.320]   Republican primaries that then lost in the general election,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.840]   well, the best MAGA candidate of all is Trump. So it David Sacks
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.280]   is completely right now, like the balance of power here should
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.400]   be if you're the democrats, whatever you can do to keep him
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.880]   in the news, whatever you can do to induce him to run, makes a
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.120]   lot of sense because he will kill cripple the Republican
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.320]   Party. He'll split he'll split.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.040]   Look at how Jake has got a big red. He's admitting to the
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.600]   hypocrisy, which is for years, he's screaming about what is
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.120]   your life? Hold on a second. You've been screaming about what
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.280]   a threat to democracy is how he's secretly on the payroll of
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.320]   the Kremlin or foreign governments and yet, and yet you
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.240]   want to keep him in the news. You want to be the nominee and
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.560]   you
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.800]   Republicans don't have the common sense to kick him out of the
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.000]   party. Oh, I do. Come on, I was on the DeSantis train before the
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.640]   midterms election. You will kick Trump out. You on this pod will
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.080]   never kick him out of the party. You should say how much
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.360]   we disavow him.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.120]   Publicly disavow him. How I've already said I support to
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.440]   Santa's. I said it before the midterms. What else do you want
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.760]   me to do? But by the way, I don't think large. I think I
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.640]   think you're I think you and many other people on the
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.360]   democratic side in the media are being very hypocritical about
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.560]   this because you want to claim that he's this unique threat to
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.200]   democracy while playing this game where you want to keep him
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.000]   in the news. You want to basically provide him with as
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.280]   much oxygen as possible because you think he's more beatable.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.320]   And by the way, I agree that he's less electable than
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.280]   DeSantis, which is why part of the reason why I'm on the
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.080]   DeSantis train. I also think DeSantis would get more done.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.760]   But look, I don't think it's a foregone conclusion. He's gonna
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   be the nominee. Did you see the new polling that came out after
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.240]   the midterms? DeSantis is now the favorite in among Republican
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.600]   primary voters among every different slicing that you want
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.840]   to do, of whether it's likely Republican voters, primary
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.000]   voters, whether it's Fox News viewers, and on and on and on.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.080]   DeSantis is now ahead of Trump by about
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.160]   Okay, wait, hold on, I need to be able to state my position
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.080]   because Saxton interrupted me seven times. I just would like
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.000]   to get my position on here. Number one, you all backed
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.640]   somebody who is a horrible human being who made terrible
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.320]   decisions. And now you guys keep supporting him at some point,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.360]   you have to put your foot down and say, Listen, we don't want
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.680]   this guy. You have to publicly say, January 6, you know, and
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   this guy's approach, the election denial, you guys have
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.000]   to come out and just say, we don't want this person to run. I
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.760]   think you've been hedging too much. I think that's the
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.440]   problem. Now, who am not? How can I get the Republican Party?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.400]   Yeah, now you always were a little bit like, because I did
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.120]   know. Hold on, hold on. And this very pot, I asked you, if he
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.960]   run, would you support him? Would you ever vote for him
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   again? And you were like, well, and you would vote for him
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.120]   again. If he wins the nomination, you'll vote for him.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.440]   That's the truth. Republicans will still vote for him.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.640]   Look, you know that before was popular before the midterms
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.160]   I was on the descents of strain. I was saying so on this pod for
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.000]   over a year when it was very unpopular, certainly in the area
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.640]   in which I live. And so you know, and there are a lot of
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.440]   Republicans now most Republicans now agree with me on this issue,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.080]   according to the polling that just took place. But if he wins
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.480]   the nomination, you will Jason is that you want us to buy into
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.880]   every bullshit narrative that you've ever told about this
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.840]   issue. January six and bullshit. No, it was a bullshit. Let him
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.880]   finish. Let him finish. He's interrupting me every two
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.760]   seconds. Stay out of it. freeberg. I just want you guys
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.920]   to guys, I just want you guys to speak and then let the other
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.800]   person speak. That's it.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.360]   My point is, here we go again. I don't I don't want to rehash
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.960]   every single thing in the past. But But look, the point is that
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   I think we have more electable candidates. I think we have
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.240]   candidates that would get more done in office. But and I've
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.120]   already said so but I you know, but I don't that doesn't mean I
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.360]   believe this whole like threat to democracy thing. I think that
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.920]   is massive inflation of the actual threat. But But look, if
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.240]   you want me to say that we have more electable candidates, we
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.880]   have candidates who will get more done, who frankly would be
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.240]   less alienating to moderates and independents and could even win
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.880]   over some moderate Democrats the way that the Santa's didn't
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.160]   Florida to win by 19 points. Yes, happy to say that. And I've
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.880]   been saying that.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.400]   I will just say, if I if I'm if I'm if freeberg allows me to
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.760]   make a point, I would like to say, it is a threat to democracy
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.600]   January six and election denial. Those two things are acute.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.240]   Why party fund over $50 million to those candidates?
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.560]   cynical because they want to win cynicism, pure cynicism.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.880]   Okay, we're on the same page about that. Yeah, yeah, it's
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.400]   pure cynicism. But do you let me ask you a question. And then
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.960]   we'll wrap on this because I know it's uncomfortable for
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.360]   freeberg to watch mommy and daddy fight.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.720]   Some childhood trauma.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.120]   Drama is okay. Mommy daddy still love each other. Even if we
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.720]   fight sometimes, it just makes me want to turn the volume down.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.120]   Go ahead. Almost done. Anyway. I do think fielding moderate
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.080]   candidates is the path. And I think you brought this up a ton
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.600]   of times who it's the race to whoever can get that moderate
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.000]   middle and I hope that they feel better candidates. But do you
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.640]   think sacks he's running? This is one of the cynical takes is
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.720]   that he's running because it will help all the legal cases
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.280]   against him. Do you think there's anything to that?
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   My guess is that that they see him as an easier candidate to
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.560]   beat and they're going to do everything they can to try and
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.400]   keep him in the news. And I don't, I actually I don't think
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.560]   that's your position. I actually think that you're being sincere
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.680]   that you don't want him to win a second term. I mean, remember,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.000]   like we don't know, I think we all believe that we're gonna
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.200]   have a pretty severe recession next year. So just because the
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.840]   democrats cynical strategy in the midterms of promoting, you
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.360]   know, what they call it election deniers in the primary that
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.120]   happened to work, but just because it worked last time
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.440]   doesn't mean it's going to work next time.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.840]   And abortion absolutists and a whole bunch of other things. I
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.880]   think I think the point is pretty much this, which is that
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.360]   people gave Trump a lot of credit for being an idiot
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.680]   savant. But it looks like he's more of an idiot savant minus
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.840]   the savant. Okay, this is a, this is kind of a goofball, who
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   has a brilliant media strategy, and he had his finger on the
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.960]   pulse in a moment. And then he just couldn't execute couldn't
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.160]   put two and two together couldn't put one foot in front
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.640]   of the other. And he was way too divisive, and he got booted out
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.760]   and he lost fair and square. And now what the republicans have to
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.680]   realize is if they don't figure out how to field somebody out of
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.560]   the primaries, that is different than Trump, the democrats will
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.880]   win. Because if it is Trump, whoever the democratic candidate
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.920]   is, I don't think it really matters. We'll crush Trump.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.480]   Yeah, look, I think that's likely correct. I mean, I think
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.800]   that we talked about it last week, you cannot win the
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.240]   presidency with call it 45% of the vote. I mean, Trump is capped
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.840]   at that amount.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.560]   And the scary thing for republicans, by the way, is
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.320]   Trump does a much better job than anybody else in getting his
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.640]   base activated. So the thing that all these polls get wrong,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.880]   and I think they've consistently gotten wrong, and as a result,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.360]   have underestimated him, is they don't give him the credit he
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.000]   deserves duly for being able to curate a fervent base of that 30
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.840]   or 40% of America that will show up for him. And even if they
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.640]   didn't show up as much in the midterms, they sure as hell
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.560]   showed up in the primaries for his candidates oftentimes. So I
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.760]   just think it's a very dangerous cocktail that you can't sleep
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.160]   on. So the republicans have to take this really serious moderate
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.040]   republicans want to have a chance of winning. You guys have
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.920]   to figure out how to beat Trump in a ground game. Because if his
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.720]   base shows up, he has a decent chance of winning the
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.560]   nomination. But then you will lose the general.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.360]   Yeah, I think that's, I think that's pretty much spot on. I
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.160]   think republicans really have to be smart and disciplined and
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.920]   think about, we have to nominate the the most electable
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.760]   candidate. But here's the thing is, we're not even debating
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.520]   policy right now. No one, no one really says that, hey, on a
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   policy basis, there's a huge difference between, say, Trump
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.960]   and DeSantis or some other folks. It's all about personal
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.640]   style. And is it really worth it to the republicans to
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.280]   potentially lose the next election, based on personal
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.200]   based on style points, it's a silly reason to lose, you know,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.720]   William F. Buckley, a long time ago said that he would always
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.360]   support the most electable, conservative candidate, he
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.800]   didn't always go with the most conservative candidate, he
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.120]   wanted to go with the most electable candidate who met a
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.680]   basic policy bar. And he sometimes got in trouble for
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.840]   that. For example, he supported Bush 41 over jack Kemp. I know
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.760]   I'm going back a long way. But But in any event, you know,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.640]   having thinking about electability is just really
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.160]   important.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.840]   There's one civil lining here, the head of the Republican Party,
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.400]   Rupert Murdoch has absolutely dissed Trump. I don't know if
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.280]   you saw the New York Post, but he put on the cover of the
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.520]   New York Post a little lower, like 10 Florida man makes
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.640]   announcement and on page 26, he had the announcement of Trump
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.080]   running for president. And the funny thing was the last
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.320]   Rupert Murdoch, he didn't even name Trump as the president of
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.000]   the absolute last line of that column. And he said, Oh, and he
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.320]   also happened to be the 45th president of the United States.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.480]   Yeah, it was very funny.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.760]   You're seeing a lot of Republicans saying, I think
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.240]   correctly, is that if you want to win elections, you have to
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.640]   look out the windshield, you know, not in the rearview
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.280]   mirror. And what we saw in the midterms is that even talking
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.040]   about 2020 was at minimum, a giant waste of time and a
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.280]   distraction and at maximum potentially cause these
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.040]   candidates to lose. I mean, the fact of the matter is that that
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.440]   a lot of candidates, including some I supported in
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.840]   battleground states who got lured into trying to
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.640]   relitigate 2020, they all got vaporized. And I just think
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.640]   it's stupid to be talking about the past. voters want you to
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.880]   focus on the future. And especially when there's no
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.840]   policy outcome that matters. That's at stake for you to be
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.720]   talking about a past election, instead of the future and
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.680]   let me ask you a question. It's just politically stupid.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.480]   freeberg. If I may bring you into this discussion
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.200]   uncomfortably, as it might as uncomfortable as it might be,
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.560]   would you vote for Biden? Incredibly old? I don't know,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.520]   it's gonna be at one or 82. And the next election, you vote for
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.640]   Biden, or DeSantis,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.560]   as I go through the list of things I'm most concerned about
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.560]   in the world today. Number one is the debt and spending cycle
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.080]   of the federal government. In the US. I'm I think it's the
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   most kind of scary set of facts and conditions that we're
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.880]   getting set up for kind of a major crisis 10 to 15 years from
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.200]   now. Because you can't afford all the debt that we've taken on
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.240]   as a country, as well as the entitlement as well as defense.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.000]   And so something's got to give and there's a bunch of paths
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.080]   that could emerge from that set of conditions that are all
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   really scary paths and not good. I'm more concerned about that
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.680]   than I am about nuclear war, or climate change. Just to be
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.360]   clear, because I think that the social effects and the global
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.800]   geopolitical effects that arise from the US kind of
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.600]   destructuring because of our debt and spending cycle that
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.680]   we're in right now, are far more significant than what we'll
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.640]   experience over the same period of time. And again, I do think
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.080]   that technology is going to resolve a lot of our issues with
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.600]   climate change. And I think nuclear war, cool heads will
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.920]   prevail, everyone's got a family. So that's what I'm most
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.960]   concerned about. So any kind of voting decision I make is made
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.440]   with that lens, which is what's the best path to supporting
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.360]   some some sort of responsibility, setback or
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.040]   stepback to resolve those issues, as Charlie Munger said
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.000]   so well in this interview that was published this week. And I
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.440]   said it a few times on the show, but he did. He's a much better
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.360]   speaker than I use as far fewer words. But you know, in
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.880]   democracy, eventually, the populace realizes they can vote
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.360]   themselves all the money. And, you know, that's what we see
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.200]   happen in an accelerated way. In Latin America, we've seen that
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.480]   with a lot of these democracies that ultimately resolved to kind
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.440]   of socialism. And in the US, we're seeing a lot of this
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.560]   behavior where we're kind of voting ourselves all the money
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.320]   we're putting in place politicians and the populace is
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.120]   saying I want I want I want, and more money comes out. And it it
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.000]   totally decreases the strength and the resiliency of our nation
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.680]   and our economy. And it's the most concerning thing to me,
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.080]   because the incredible innovation and economic engine
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.200]   that is the United States is threatened. And it really
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.960]   threatens a lot of stability in the world today.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.960]   Chama. Any any final thoughts here as we wrap up the political
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.840]   discussion? Obviously, a democrat, so you're voting for
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.480]   Biden, but you also care about fiscal responsibility. So where
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.080]   are you at? With your vote for 2024?
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.440]   I don't think that we know who's actually running on either
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.040]   ticket yet, just to be completely honest. So that's my
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.360]   perspective. My other comment is, I think what David said is
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.000]   so spot on the single biggest issue that we have is that we
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.040]   have made a huge decision to de globalize. And that de
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.960]   globalization has the risk of introducing a hyperinflation
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.120]   loop. And we won't know how bad that is for another year or two.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.080]   Why would it do that? Why would it? Well, think about it this
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.240]   way.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:01.040]   So today, let's just say you buy a chip to make the iPhone, you
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.640]   buy that chip from, you know, TSMC that makes it in Taiwan
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   ships it to China. And the entire world is serviced with
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.120]   that supply chain that keeps that chip as cheap as possible.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.640]   Now, with the chip sacked, as an example, we will build resilient
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.480]   supply chains, where now instead of one place, it'll come from
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.520]   six places, five of those six will be in allied territories,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.800]   the United States, Western Europe, potentially Mexico. The
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.000]   thing with that is that that now is six x more equipment that
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.400]   you're buying. Right? Instead of one machine, you now have six
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.600]   machines. Instead of one person operating the machine in one
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   country, you have six people in six countries. As you can
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.440]   imagine, when you layer up all these costs, there is no world
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.440]   in which that chip is as cheap as it was before. And so the
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.680]   cost of that has to be born either by the consumer who pays
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.760]   a higher price, that's measured as inflation, or by the
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.160]   government who subsidizes it at the point of import, that'll be
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.240]   measured by debt. And so one way or the other, in our in our path
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.600]   now towards more resiliency, and national security, which by the
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.840]   way, I think is the absolute right decision. Okay. Energy
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.040]   independence, all of this stuff we have to do today, we are at
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.120]   risk of a hyper inflationary loop, if not managed well. And
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.600]   so you have to be really on the levers of the economy, and you
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.360]   have to understand it deeply, the person that deserves the
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.400]   most credit of preventing this hyper inflationary loop right
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.960]   now is Joe Manchin. And hopefully the history books,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.240]   whatever Jay Powell does, I think has been good. But the
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.640]   fact that mansion prevented 6 trillion more dollars of being
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.120]   pumped into the economy in the last two years, is probably the
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.760]   single thing that prevented inflation instead of being
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.560]   peaking at nine from peaking at 15 or 16. I think it would have
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.760]   been a national disaster without that
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.440]   Chamath is right that extra 6 trillion that Manchester would
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.640]   have been a national disaster. But let's also give credit to
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.440]   every Republican because they also voted against it. I mean,
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.760]   the fact that the pressure was on mansion to do the thing and
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.200]   see the forest from the trees and he did that.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.240]   Yeah, no, look, I agree. I agree that I encourage I agree that he
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.400]   was in the hot seat. Well, so a cinema, by the way, cinema
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.880]   didn't go for the three and a half trillion build back better.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.200]   But then mansion, you went along with the $750 billion version of
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.120]   BBB, which they renamed the inflation Reduction Act. That
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.760]   was kind of a disappointment. So frankly, like I give more
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.200]   credit to the Republicans, they were against all of it. And the
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.960]   Democrats jammed it through. So if you're worried about all of
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.640]   this trillions and trillions of unnecessary spending, once you
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.800]   give the chance,
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.400]   I'm talking about the delta between what was spent and what
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.240]   could have been the entirety of the gap is really was prevented
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.960]   by Joe mansion.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.680]   I know, but it was Joe mansion siding with the Republicans. My
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.280]   point is, look, we got your point perfect on spending. They
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.160]   both want to spend too much money. But at this particular
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.280]   moment in time, the Republicans are more restrained about
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.560]   spending than the Democrats.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.080]   Let's go to number one issue for each person. Hold on. Number
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.400]   one issue for freeberg is fiscal responsibility. I was going to
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.440]   say the same thing. It is my number one issue in this next
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.800]   election. I want to see austerity fiscal responsibility
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.840]   and get this spending under control so that our kids do not
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.960]   inherit, you know, stagflation, hyperinflation, or whatever
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.880]   cocktail of disastrous economic policies we are handing to them.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   What is your number one issue? sacks for 2024? If you had to
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.680]   pick a number one issue, what would it be for David Sachs?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.840]   Look, I think it's simple. The President's job is to ensure
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.120]   peace and prosperity. So you guys are talking about the
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.880]   prosperity side, I think we do need fiscal responsibility, we
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.680]   need to have a good economy, there's like a bundle of
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.200]   policies that go into that starting with, I think, greater
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.960]   fiscal restraint. And then on the peace side, I think we need
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.680]   to adjust America's foreign policy to be less
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.040]   interventionist. We're, you know, we're involving ourselves
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.680]   here, there and everywhere all over the world. And I, I'm
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.720]   hopeful that what I'm hearing out of the administration in the
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.680]   last couple weeks, from Jake Sullivan, from Millie, these are
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.280]   some good things that I'm hearing. But, you know, I would
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.040]   like to see us dial back on the foreign interventionism.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.960]   If you had to 6040 that or whatever, is one more important
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.680]   the other or they both equal and then we'll go to both equal for
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.640]   you, which one's more important?
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.280]   Both. I mean, look, how can you have a successful United States
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.760]   if we're either in a recession or at war, you don't want any
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.920]   either of those situations.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   So those are your top two equally, what is it for you,
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.240]   Chamath? What are you there?
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.920]   There's also a third one, which is culture, J Cal. So this one's
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.320]   a little bit hard to categorize. But I do think culture matters.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.400]   And, you know, I want us to have a culture of excellence. I want
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.160]   in the schools, for example, I think schools should have
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.560]   grades, they should have advanced math, we should hold
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.480]   our kids to a high standard. I think that we want to have safe
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.680]   cities, we want to, you know, have cities where crime's not
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.640]   out of control. We need to have, you know, a sound border policy.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.560]   So I think there's like a collection of policies there
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.880]   under, you know, schools, crime border that are sort of broadly
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.200]   cultural, I guess. But or maybe you could call them quality of
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.600]   life issues. So you know, yeah, we need to have a good economy,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.040]   we need to stay out of foreign wars, but also we need to have
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.680]   a high quality of life.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.920]   Can I steel man something for you? Because I, I really agree
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.720]   with those three things, David, that you said, but I've, I've
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.000]   spent a lot of time thinking about this. And my formation is
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.800]   that there's one thing that allows us to solve all three, if
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.320]   you bear with me for a second. And I think that that is the
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.880]   energy independence of the United States. If you look
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.960]   inside of what's happening in the US today, the cost of
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.720]   generating energy is effectively as cheap as it's ever been, and
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.320]   as close to zero as it ever has been, and it's only going to get
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.800]   cheaper. The problem that we have is that we have all of
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.400]   these decrepit laws and infrastructure and regulatory
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.600]   capture, that causes us to always be in an imbalance. And
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.240]   as a result, we do all kinds of crazy things. We borrow enormous
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.200]   amounts of money to create subsidies, we go and we fight
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.880]   all of these, you know, foreign wars that don't make any sense.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.560]   We wrap the energy problem and set in climate change language
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.120]   would cause us this cultural division. But my belief, quite
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.040]   honestly, is that the reason the IRA was so important is as it is
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.480]   the most clarified piece of legislation we've seen, that
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.120]   essentially puts all forms of energy on a level playing field
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.320]   and has the chance to get America to permanent energy
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.920]   independence. And if the cost of energy is zero, and we can
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.800]   abundantly create it in the United States, what I think
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.160]   happens, David is we have energy to rebuild our supply chain much
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.520]   cheaper. So inflation gets under control, we don't borrow as
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.440]   much, we have a completely different lens on foreign
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.480]   policy, so that this interventionism and fighting over
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.720]   resources is much harder to justify. And we put the climate
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.600]   change language aside, and we use energy independence as a
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.080]   form of national security, which gives us the courage to battle
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.560]   all these other cultural taboos that we otherwise have to say we
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.080]   agree with, even if they don't necessarily make any sense. And
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.040]   there's a bunch of them. So I don't know my, my answer to your
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.960]   question, Jason, is that one thing, if we accomplish in the
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.680]   next five to 10 years, has a chance to really change the
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.880]   course of the United States.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.640]   Right, and then so I'm guessing then Biden's your vote, because
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.720]   if it is in fact, Biden, because Biden is the one who pushed for
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.280]   these clean energy tax credits and this policy in it.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.840]   Free, but you also cancel, you also cancel our energy
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.640]   independence. I mean, look, we were energy independent based on
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.240]   fracking, you may not like fracking, but it did get us
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.320]   energy independent. And you may think that there's environmental
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.160]   consequences to it that you don't like, and that has to be
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.840]   balanced. But we did have
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   an against fracking, I believe in that gas, I believe in coal,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.360]   actually, as a bridge fuel, I believe in all of these things.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.880]   I believe that these are all more important than going off to
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.040]   all of these foreign lands, and trying to justify spending
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.120]   trillions of dollars and putting 10s of 1000s of American lives
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.880]   at risk, essentially for resources that we can actually
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.920]   create for ourselves at home.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.200]   Well, I agree with you on that 100%.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.160]   I'm fine with I mean, I'll tell you like clean fracking as a way
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.600]   as a bridge, go ahead to getting to, you know, more independence
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.840]   through nuclear and renewable scratch free birth,
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.400]   like I said before, China's declared that they're building
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.120]   450 nuclear power plants, the net cost, effective cost of
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.480]   electricity production out of a nuclear power plant is somewhere
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.840]   between one and five cents per kilowatt hour, the US on average
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.240]   is paying 11 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour. Nuclear is just
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.880]   through utilities. So free bird that's with all the regulatory
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   capture and all that crash that you have to spend, for example,
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.920]   we have to spend $220 billion a year to replace the power lines
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.000]   in America by law. That's $2.2 trillion just there.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.040]   Right. And so the cost for solar and wind off grid, I think is
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.480]   around three to seven cents a kilowatt hour in that range,
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.440]   right. So it gets nowadays, it's gotten much more competitive.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:03.240]   But I think that the nuclear solution is just not even being
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.160]   engaged in the conversation. Now, I want to go back to the
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.040]   previous point, which is because I didn't state the numbers
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.640]   before. So I just want to state them because they're so shocking.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.840]   And this is what what shocks me. The current federal debt is $30
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.600]   trillion, our GDP is around 23 trillion 5% interest rates on
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.480]   $30 trillion is one and a half trillion dollars in interest
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.280]   payments alone every year. And our social security so one and a
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:33.480]   half trillion dollars. I mean, that alone is about 6% 7% of
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.000]   GDP. So you have to tax every transaction in the country by
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.920]   six or 7% just to pay the interest payments on the debt.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.600]   And then we have Medicare and Social Security.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.680]   That math is wrong. Because you have maturities of all different
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.840]   types with different yield to maturities and different coupons.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:54.760]   That's it's not today's numbers. It's what's happening over time.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.320]   So as you look out, and you look at the yield on treasuries, and
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.360]   you apply that to the current debt level, and the increment in
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.000]   the debt level, you'll get to that level, right, you'll get to
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.080]   a trillion five a year in interest payments that need to
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.920]   be made, plus another call it three, four or $5 trillion a
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.240]   year in mandatory spending. And so that's where the country
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.960]   starts to run into a problem. Because at some point when you
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.400]   have to tax so much to cover the cash payments that need to be
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.440]   made by the federal government, the economy really gets hurt,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.080]   and things start to cripple. And then if you were to take those
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.840]   entitlements away, Social Security, Medicare, you have a
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.560]   real problem with people's ability to support themselves in
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.680]   an economy where they're not working. These are elderly
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.880]   retired people. So there is a need at work to pay these
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.800]   expensive medical bills. So there's a major crash coming if
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.640]   we don't figure out how to bridge our way to this gap. So
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.840]   if someone wants my vote, and they're going to run for
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   president, they would put up a simple chart like Bill Clinton
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.440]   used to do, and show me a 10 to 30 year plan and just say,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.600]   here's where we're headed. And here's what we're going to do to
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.880]   make sure that doesn't happen. And that chart alone, I think
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.560]   can win the vote.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.200]   Okay, let's pull up the chart then. So here is the federal
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.800]   debt total public debt as a percentage of gross domestic
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.000]   product. As you can see, in the 70s and 80s, we were at under
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.480]   50%. The 90s, we started, you know, growing, I don't think
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.320]   this matters. I think everybody, every self proclaimed
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.520]   intellectual looks at this chart and says, Oh, my God, we've
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.600]   exceeded 100%. You know, the the Empire is going to go to ruin.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.640]   That's not why the Empire goes to ruin, we have the reserve
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.040]   currency of the of the world. And there's an enormous amount
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.920]   of power that comes from that position. So what the right
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.280]   number is, is TBD. That's the most honest way to think about
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.080]   it. It was 100. It's at 150. It could go to 200. Many countries
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.640]   operate at levels above us and still haven't imploded per se.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.200]   The real thing is what part of what Friedberg said is, look, if
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.960]   you really want to look at what we pay, today, we pay $400
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.920]   billion this year, that's the interest payments, okay, that's
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.720]   when you calculate all of the different maturities we have,
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.600]   with all of the different coupons we have, that's what we
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.320]   owe today. And David is right, mathematically, that if interest
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.680]   rates go to 5%, and stay there forever, but we know that that's
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.880]   not how economies work, they ebb and flow. Okay. So the real
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.680]   problem that we have to understand is how do you
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.120]   actually create enough growth. And then the next time that we
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.520]   have a meaningful fall in interest rates, like every other
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.320]   person does, you know, look, a lot of people in America know
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   how to refi their credit cards, refi their home loans, refi their
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.840]   mortgages, the United States could have had a much more
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.640]   aggressive and thoughtful strategy of refi by pushing out
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.120]   these maturities way into the future. And again, Trump
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.280]   actually suggested that but because he sounded like a
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.960]   goofball, everybody said absolutely no way. But in
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.040]   hindsight, that one move would have saved us trillions of
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.560]   dollars over the next decade if we had done it and this time
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.520]   around, we have to have politicians who are smart enough
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.120]   and have the wherewithal to say, it doesn't matter where this
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.360]   idea came from. It's really smart. rates are now back to 2%
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.760]   or one and a half percent. Let's now issue 50 and 100 year bonds.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.400]   And let's refi this problem out into the future. That makes a
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.640]   ton of sense. And we have to do it.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.760]   The refi makes a ton of sense. Just to pull up a chart here.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:15.200]   And to counter your position there that it doesn't matter
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.760]   much a month. Maybe you can respond to if you look at GDP
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.360]   ratios here. Number one, two and three, Japan, Venezuela, Greece,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.720]   Sudan. And, you know, you know, some smaller countries there,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.240]   but United States currently, none of these countries, look,
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.120]   how would you respond to this entire world runs on the US
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.880]   dollar complex? Whenever we raise rates? Yes, it is true
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.080]   that on the one hand, our interest payments go up, but
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   proportionately and on a relative basis, he I think maybe
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.520]   let me take a step back. Look, what are the most important
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.120]   things in investing, which is appropriate here is that people
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.000]   ask, what is the price of a stock? Well, before you go
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.720]   public, you're calculating what the intrinsic value of a company
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.400]   is, okay, all the things that they do all the money that they
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.360]   make, here's what we think it's theoretically work worth. But
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.720]   the minute it goes public, the intrinsic value no longer
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   matters. It's what is it valued relative to everything else?
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.360]   Okay. The United States is a relative, if it's a stock, if
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.840]   all these countries are stocks, we are valued relatively to
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.560]   others, not not intrinsically. And the reason why we have so
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.120]   much power is because everybody else is actually valued relative
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.640]   to us. So this is why I think the right thing to look at Jason
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.480]   is the rate of change of debt to GDP for the entire g eight, or
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.240]   g 20, or the rest of the world. And what you'll see is something
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.360]   that goes up into the right, nobody in the world has been
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.480]   rewarded for not investing in their populations and bought and
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.680]   basically borrowing from tomorrow to invest in today's
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.160]   human capital. Okay, so we have a disagreement here. Freeberg,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.840]   you think this is a major issue? Yeah, because I think it's
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.040]   manageable. Freeberg. Yeah. For I think there's two things that
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.440]   are missing. One is the inflationary effect. So you look
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.120]   at that list of countries that are there, they're paying higher
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.560]   interest, and they're paying in the form of inflation. So they
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.440]   have less that they can spend on their people. And ultimately,
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.320]   what ends up happening, it's just simple arithmetic, it's not
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.560]   about relative value of a currency. It's the arithmetic
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.760]   that we have a check we have to write every month to pay for
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.600]   Medicare and Social Security, and it is written into law, what
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.480]   that check needs to be. And the rate at which we're having to
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.380]   write those checks, the increment of those checks is
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.840]   going up so significantly that when you add on the interest
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.680]   payments, and you look at those checks, and then you add on
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.480]   defense, something's got to give because you cannot raise taxes
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.880]   in the amount that's needed to fund all of that outlay without
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.640]   this causing either number one, massive inflation, if you just
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   take on more debt, or number two, you know, significant loss
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.040]   of services, either Social Security, Medicare or defense,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.920]   and so something's going to give and the distribution I think is
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.680]   not being discussed.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.440]   Sorry, just one just one point the President's budget, anybody
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.080]   who is a president of the United States gets hold of their annual
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.720]   budget, it's about five and a half trillion dollars this year.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.400]   So you're talking about interest payments that are still less than
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.720]   10% of their total budget. Now that includes the entitlement
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.600]   payments, okay, so about $3 billion, $3 trillion, sorry,
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.840]   three and a half trillion is what you have to pay for 20%. No,
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.120]   $3 trillion is the sum of Medicare and Social Security.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   Okay, so the President still has one and a half to $2 trillion
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.480]   of leeway, of which a quarter are debt payments. So my
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.640]   perspective, quite honestly, is mathematically, there's a lot of
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.960]   room to run here, before these things get really out of control.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.720]   And even if they do, I think the relative problem is for the rest
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.840]   of the world will be so egregious, that the ability for
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.440]   the United States to go to those banks and those economies, and
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.560]   basically sell in more us debt is quite high, because they
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.160]   cannot afford to own debt in their own country. So if you
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   think that the United States is bad, go back to that list. Guess
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.080]   what those central banks in those countries are going to be
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.000]   buying us dollars faster than they can go out of style,
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.920]   unless we see some union of India, China, Saudi Arabia,
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.680]   Russia, Japan, Brazil, obviously not Japan, but some some of that
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   consortia will become a closer trading partner, and perhaps
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.840]   could cause a shift in the balance of the dominance of the
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.720]   US dollar. And that's one path to to consider.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.320]   Saks, what do you think of the balance sheet here? Obviously,
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.920]   we have two opposing opinions here from Chamath and Freeberg.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.120]   Where do you stand on the United States balance sheet? Are we
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   over our skis?
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.760]   Yes, the balance sheet is a disaster. What are we at like
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.960]   130% of debt to GDP? I mean, we have like 30. Yeah, it's not
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.560]   even stable. I mean, we can't spend 27% of GDP right now. 27%
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.680]   it should be 15%. Right. So the spending where does that number
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.560]   come from? Why? There's a there's a bunch of economists
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.880]   who have shared these papers. Morons, morons, morons, fake,
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   fake.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.920]   If you look at if you look at government tax receipts over
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.000]   time, with all different kinds of tax rates, including very,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.440]   very different top marginal tax rates, what you see is that a
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.760]   federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP is in the 17
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.040]   to 19% range. And like the best years you make 19% it's usually
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.920]   in a good economy. And in a bad economy, it's like 17%. And it
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.280]   really it doesn't matter whether Reagan was president or Clint
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.400]   Bill Clinton, and so on. So there's only so much blood you
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.160]   can get from a stone. And historically spending was around
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:35.680]   19% of GDP. And so you would have a one or 2% you know,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.160]   deficit every year. And that really accelerated first you had
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.760]   the financial crisis of 2008. And then you had COVID. And
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.120]   free works, right, you know, we we went from call it your 20% of
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.840]   GDP spending to roughly 30% or more during COVID as kind of
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.840]   this emergency measure. But like everything else in government,
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.920]   you know, the emergency measure becomes a permanent program. So
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.640]   now we're at 27%. It doesn't seem to be going down. And the
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.000]   Democrats want a lot more. I mean, we talked about it build
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.120]   back better would have been three and a half trillion,
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.920]   instead of 750 billion, if they just had one or two more votes.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.840]   So hold on. So so free burgers, right? There's like nothing
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.240]   stable about the point we're at. It's the point we're at is bad
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.800]   on its own terms, having 30 trillion of debt, let's say that
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.080]   interest rates stabilize at 3%. That's still a trillion a year
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.840]   of debt service, which is more than not a trillion. If interest
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.960]   rates stabilize at 3%, which is optimistic, and we're servicing
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.200]   a trillion, sorry, 30 trillion of debt, that's roughly a
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.720]   billion dollars a year of debt service payments. That could be
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.080]   spent on other things. Guys keep saying billion when it's a
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.440]   trillion.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.840]   The average yield to maturity needs to be factored in there.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.880]   So over a 15 year period, David, you would be right
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.080]   mathematically, if all matured, but that's not what this is,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.600]   because you rear you'd have to refi and reissue a bunch of debt
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.880]   that is at lower yield right now at these interest rates. I want
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.400]   to be clear.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.880]   I'm not sure how any of this is good. I mean, remember,
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.400]   I understand.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.080]   Let your mouth say why I'm good or not.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.480]   I'm not saying that this is a good or it's a trend. What I'm
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.640]   saying is I have this issue that all of a sudden people make up
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.960]   and you guys are doing it now. An arbitrary number with no
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.560]   rooting in history or fact and say this is bad. And all I'm
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.080]   saying is, I know it feels bad to us. And I think we would all
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.760]   run this country differently. If we could control the balance
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.040]   sheet, I would as well. I would try to get debt way way down, I
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.080]   would try to get deficits way way down. But all I'm saying is
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.880]   using this justification of an arbitrary number always falls
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.720]   flat. So I'm encouraging us all. Let's find a better model of
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.880]   reasoning. Because every time we point to some Randall's book
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.960]   and say 127% is bad. Nobody listens. And I think the
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.800]   message that you should take away is is because it's
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.240]   imprecise, and it's not rooted in any actual logic. And if
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.760]   there's a better building, the reason I believe that this is
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.960]   concerning is, I look at the top 10 countries that have, you
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.760]   know, debt ratios that seem out of whack. And I think, wow, what
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.800]   is their fortune been for the last 10 years vis a vis Japan
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.040]   and Venezuela, the right comparison, the right comparison.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.560]   Okay, well, I can say, look at the British Empire. And when and
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.040]   what was the debt to GDP when it started to actually fall off?
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.960]   Does anybody know?
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.760]   I know. No, I'm saying okay, was it triggered? Was it triggered
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.520]   by debt to GDP? And I think your answer will be in part. I can
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.920]   ruin us. They took on ruinous debt, and they couldn't maintain
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.960]   their empire anymore. And the whole thing collapsed. I'm just
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.400]   asking for some numerical specificity.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.960]   Right?
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:41.080]   The last time there was a lot of numerical specificity. There is
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.480]   a ton of work that's been done on why does the word pulling
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.200]   shit out of their ass? So tell us that it's historically the
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.520]   best way to manage the growth in a in a in a country is to have
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.200]   deficit spending be equal to or less than the growth rate of the
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.600]   economy of that country. So for example, if your income, the tax
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.080]   revenue that's being generated by the government is equal to
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.520]   say 15% of GDP, you do not want your spending to be more than
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.400]   17 or 18%. If the economic growth rate is two to 3%. That's
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   it. If you do anything more than what happens? No, if you
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.200]   do anything more than that you're borrowing from the
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.600]   future to pay for today. That's the simple truth. Okay, so what
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.560]   happens? And when you do that, the rates go up and the prices
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.080]   go up and eventually your currency doesn't work. So you're
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.200]   making a bet. Read the book that I talked about last year, the
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.080]   most recent Ray Dalio book, he goes through six stories with
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.560]   the economic data to prove it the factual data, the history of
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.640]   what's happened with six empires over the last 500 years, where
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.360]   this exact same scenario has played out. This isn't some
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.640]   random arbitrary story. I read that book. And everyone in that
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.320]   everyone had the exact same perspective that you have when
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.440]   they were living in those days. And they said, You know what,
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.600]   we're gonna be okay, because we're the reserve currency can
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.360]   and the world loves us. And we're the empire and we have
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.120]   influence everywhere. And they all lost primacy and their
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.840]   currencies collapsed. And they all broke apart. And I'm not
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.720]   saying that that can't happen in America. What I'm saying is, you
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.960]   get so full throated. I read that book. It's great narrative,
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.120]   but the numbers are brittle. Okay, they're fragile, and
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.600]   they're mostly made up. Okay, so read it. So all I'm saying is,
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.760]   in the absence in the absence of numerical specificity, I agree
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.600]   with you that this trend is alarming, and it's bad. I agree
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.400]   with you. And I agree that we should spend a lot less. What
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.520]   I'm saying is when you say to the world, stop spending because
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.640]   XYZ number is bad. You have no credibility because it's not
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.520]   something that you can actually back up. And all I'm saying is,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.560]   if you could find a better logical argument, you would
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.920]   probably get a lot more people to you can show it to you're
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.720]   just being ignorant. You're ignoring it. You're saying you
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.680]   don't want to actually believe it. The numbers are there. I'm
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.400]   not saying ignorant a disparaging way. I'm saying
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.600]   you're literally just ignoring the show. Show me the numbers.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   Show it to me.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   They get upset at us for fighting.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.680]   I'll make you a PDF. I'll send it to you tonight. I promise.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.280]   And I'll post it on our friggin things that people can watch it.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.760]   All right. Listen, the the group chat is going to be on fire this
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.200]   weekend. Sacks final word for you.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.400]   Okay, final word. Okay,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.240]   final, please.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.000]   do it before like this, but
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.680]   opposite sides. I think it's great. I still respect and love
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.080]   each other.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.000]   If you go back in history and look at jet debt to GDP levels,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.200]   the only other time where anything remotely like the level
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.240]   we're at right now is right after World War Two, when we had
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.720]   just saved the world from Nazism. Okay, that was worth
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.840]   going into debt for you look today, what is it that we've
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.720]   gotten into this 130% debt to GDP? What is this $30 trillion
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.760]   of debt for? What have we bought with all that money? Huge
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.000]   amounts of it have been squandered. You're right. And
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Biden wanted more if the courts didn't stop him. He would have
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.840]   spent a trillion.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.480]   For giving a bunch of student loans for basket. Your degrees
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.600]   are liberal studies or whatever.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.720]   Graduate degrees at Brown.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.080]   Let me finish the point number one is that this money is being
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.520]   squandered at levels we've never seen before. And the
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.720]   squandering is continuing. It's not like we've reached a steady
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.840]   state. It just keeps going and going. And it goes on. I can't
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.680]   precisely saw it. So again, I can't precisely say when it's
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.480]   going to break, but I do know it's going to break. The other
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.640]   thing, point number two, is about consequences today, there
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.200]   is a phenomenon economists call crowding out, where when
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.320]   interest rates go up, more and more money flows into the risk
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.880]   free rate of return. And then that crowds out investment
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.680]   capital. And we've talked about it on the last pod where if the
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.160]   risk free rate is 5%, and then like high quality corporate
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.640]   bonds are offering eight to 10%. Now equity investments must
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.560]   generate 15%. And VC must generate 20%. And there are very
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.760]   few VC investments that can generate that kind of IRR. So
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.640]   what happens, the money flows out of VC, and there's less
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.960]   money for risk capital, what drives our economy risk taking
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.680]   data on for North ship. So hold on a second. So this massive
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.880]   debt service that we have, which drives up interest rates will
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.080]   crowd out the very kind of economic activity that the
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.920]   United States needs to stay on the cutting edge.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.960]   Chama rebuttal, rebuttal to the rebuttal to the rebuttal. No,
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.240]   you're so right. So why don't you just bookend the argument
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.560]   exactly the way you just did. My point is not that you said it
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.880]   just before that we don't know at what upper bound these things
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.800]   break or don't break. And all I'm saying is every time you
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.560]   throw up a random number, you guys sound like the boy who
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.800]   cries wolf, okay, and you're shouting into a vacuum is, is
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.560]   just the as the advice that I'm trying to give you guys, I agree
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.880]   with you. I spend my entire days investing in and trying to
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.600]   figure out what is the risk adjusted rate of return of the
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.080]   things that I'm doing. And I'm trying to tell you as somebody
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.440]   with some reasonable financial numeracy, every time I hear you
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.680]   or Ray Dalio or somebody else say, this number is where it
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.120]   all breaks, and it doesn't, you lose a little bit of
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.560]   credibility, then you go to this number, and you're like, Oh, at
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.280]   127. We get your point.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:03.680]   No, let me put it back. How much is too much? How much debt can
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.240]   we handle? And how much spending as a percentage GDP? Should we
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:11.600]   handle? What is the limit in your mind? And how do you decide
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.960]   what that limit can or should be?
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.000]   I think the honest answer is every time that I have been
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.320]   alarmed that we had hit a threshold that was meaningful.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.760]   So for example, like I think under Obama, we passed 100. And
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.840]   it felt very scary, because I was like, wow, that seems like a
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.440]   demarcation. It turned out to not be a demarcation at all.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.200]   Because it's relative to every other country and what they're
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.640]   going through. And I understand that you don't want to believe
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.680]   that. But I do think that America's economic vitality is
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.120]   not an independent function, it is a dependent function on
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.280]   everybody else, we are relative to everybody else, if there's a
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.840]   different cosmos and a different planet somewhere, maybe this
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.840]   will all reset. But right now it's not. And so we all trade
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:57.160]   relative to the United States. And in as much, I would like to
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.120]   just say, I don't know enough to guess what this number is. And
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.080]   I'd rather focus on what David said, which is, there are things
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.760]   that we need to do that we need to incentivize people to invest
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.360]   in extreme risk taking that create new businesses that move
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.560]   the world forward. You can have that conversation without belly
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.600]   aching and crying to mommy about a GD debt to GDP number because
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.320]   every time you throw it out there, nobody knows what you're
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.720]   talking about. Nobody knows what reaction to have. And everybody
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.000]   feels over time, David Friedberg that you're crying wolf. So all
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.520]   I'm saying is, I get that it's concerning to you. And it
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.560]   creates anxiety. But every time you and you probably this is not
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.120]   the first time you've had anxiety, you probably had
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:41.000]   anxiety at 5075 100125. Guess what, I bet you'll have anxiety
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.400]   at 150. I don't know what it means. I do know what sacks
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.000]   means, though, which is that right now we have a risk free
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.120]   rate that's going to five, we have corporate bonds, it'll be
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.920]   a 10. We have equity investing, the most risk taking, which is
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.320]   the early stage venture that has to return 25. And that is an
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.480]   incredibly high bar. But we need to do it. And we need to do
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.080]   maybe fewer investments, quite honestly, with fewer
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.680]   participants, with less dollars that are more effectively put to
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.320]   work, okay, maybe this is a good jumping off point to talk about
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.720]   all the waste in Silicon Valley. And that stuff can happen
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.000]   without debating incessantly, this debt to GDP number.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.640]   All right, freeberg sacks, and then we're gonna move. Go. I
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.320]   agree. I've never had anxiety about debt to GDP. It's never
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.120]   been anything on my radar. The conversation I'm trying to have
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:36.160]   today is the amount of spending the federal spending, including
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.480]   interest payments, as a percent of the GDP as a percent of how
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.760]   much we can tax to pay all those to make all those payments every
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.600]   year. And so what I'm concerned about is the ballooning cost of
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.440]   paying out all the obligations the federal government has to say
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.680]   something different than what you were just saying that if you
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.720]   were cared about only that, then refinancing the debt is an
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.800]   equally valid proposition and changing the duration expense.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.760]   It's not the only expense. So interest payments are ballooning.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.000]   In addition to interest payments, Social Security and
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.800]   Medicare payments are also ballooning and defense out of
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.080]   control spending. Everybody has their hand out. Everybody wants
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.240]   an air drop those four big categories together. You don't
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.160]   have any room left.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.600]   You're talking about discipline in spending in defense. Great. I
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.080]   agree. You're talking about discipline and capping health
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.280]   care costs. Great. I agree. What does that have to do with this
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.840]   other orthogonal thing you've been talking about, which is
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.960]   this random number that the GDP it doesn't
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.520]   let's move on from that discussion.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.920]   One final point that we can move on. So so look, I think time for
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.160]   the final point. Go. It's important discussion. Apparently
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.080]   luck in the in the interest of bestie harmony. I will partially
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.960]   agree with the point that your mouth is making, which is that
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.040]   for a long time in American politics, people have sort of
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.080]   cried wolf about debt to GDP. For example, if you remember way
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.800]   back in 1992, Ross Perot, basically based his candidacy on
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.880]   the idea that the US was racking up way too much debt. You know
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:07.720]   what debt to GDP was in 1992? 41%. Okay, so people used to care
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.960]   a lot about this. I remember when Reagan was president and
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.360]   jet to GP was 30%. People were saying that he was this like,
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   you know, wild spender, okay. But I think that precisely
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:23.400]   because nothing broke at 3040 80% 100%, you then had the rise
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.840]   of this theory called MMT or modern monetary theory, which
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.720]   said that the debt to GDP debts don't matter. If you're the
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.800]   reserve currency, you can print as much money as you want. And
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.920]   so people started indulging in this. And so now I actually
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.080]   think we are at a point I can't say precisely where it breaks.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:44.560]   But I do think that because debt to GDP didn't seem to matter for
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.160]   so long, I actually think we got carried away. And now we're at
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:52.280]   levels which are just going to be ruinous, if for no other
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.760]   reason than our debt service is going to crowd out. Whether you
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.920]   want more guns or more butter in our federal budget, if you want
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.320]   more defense spending, you want more entitlements, you want more
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.160]   discretionary spending, there's no question that debt service is
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.960]   getting bigger and bigger is going to crowd out those
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.440]   programs. There's no question we need to spend less. I 100% agree
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.680]   with you. Okay. But all I'm saying is, we should spend less
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.360]   on defense because we have different ways of defending
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.120]   ourselves. That should be the logical argument for less
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.840]   energy independence is defense and a balanced budget could be
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.960]   defense as well. If you look at the IRA, that was less than a
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.240]   trillion dollars over a decade. Okay, that has the potential to
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.400]   shift trillions of dollars a year in defense spending. Yes.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.560]   Okay, okay. So let me wrap. Okay, let me wrap here for a
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.200]   second. Thank you. You can look at these bills in and of
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.840]   themselves, and try to actually do the right thing. Without
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.840]   wrapping up all of these random arguments. And I by the way,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.440]   just be clear. I don't believe in it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.400]   The world's worst moderator. Come on.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:00.720]   Actually, during the Obama presidency, we had a thing
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.920]   called the sequester. I don't know if you guys remember this.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:08.120]   Yeah, Republicans and Democrats agreed that basically that
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.880]   because we had just had like these trillion dollar deficits
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.360]   because of the 2008 global financial crisis, they got
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.640]   together and said, Listen, we're going to hold the line on
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.160]   spending. And there'll be no increase on defense spending in
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:25.120]   exchange for no increase in discretionary spending social
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.280]   programs. And for a few years, we held the line on spending
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.680]   actually. And then of course, both Democrats, Republicans
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.600]   didn't want that for different reasons. And the sequester went
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.920]   away. We need to go back to something like that.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.840]   There are two things.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.040]   One one detail, like when you go and send a bill, so look, the
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.240]   way you pass a bill, right, you have to send it to the CBO to
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.360]   get scored. One of the things that I learned this week is that
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.840]   sometimes the CBO and they're not really empowered to actually
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.320]   tell you how things get offset. So for example, like if you have
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.480]   a medicine, what they will do is say, well, we'll look at at the
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.560]   population level, how much would this medicine cost if it's taken
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.680]   by the population. But if that medicine then all of a sudden
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.160]   has the potential to actually off ramp you over here, those
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.040]   savings are not really factored in as well. So David, to your
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.160]   point, another way that we can refine how we build budgets to
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.840]   make sure that we're not overspending is to actually
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.240]   improve the toolkit and the data that like the CBO is given so
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.760]   that when they score things, they can actually look at the
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.640]   total impact like for example, like the IRA. Again, one of the
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.120]   biggest benefits will be to defend spending. If we choose to
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.560]   make those cuts, you will be able to do it differently once
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.120]   we have, you know, no reliance on foreign energy.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.920]   Okay, to wrap this segment, the first segment, which took 57
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.120]   minutes, it's obviously really well, I think it's an important
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.440]   discussion. Hey, Jake, how would you vote for a dissenters to be
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.840]   promises fiscal responsibility? Well, here's the thing, I am
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.960]   going to take a look at the candidates, I'm going to make
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.280]   the best decision in terms of what I think is that I'm
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:01.760]   answering like you're giving no answer is this. Yeah, it depends
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.000]   on if the Santa's gives you everything you want a fiscal
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.680]   policy. Why wouldn't you vote for him? If he stays out if he
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.880]   if he's in favor of a woman's right to choose for the first 15
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.720]   weeks, that's Florida policy. Are you Yes. You know, I would
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.640]   take a look. I would take a look. I honestly would like not
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.560]   to vote for him 15 weeks right to choose, combined with fiscal
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:28.800]   responsibility. I I'm voting for a moderate this time. And tax
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.520]   cuts. Okay, but to wrap up here, the two things that matter, I
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.760]   believe, and based on our panels discussion, austerity and
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.480]   excellence are what are going to get us out of this mess. Here's
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.760]   what the platform seems to be shaping up our 2024 platform
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.040]   control spending. Everybody here thinks that's important. Energy
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.440]   independence, everybody here thinks that's super important.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.520]   Stop fighting unnecessary wars, and maybe rethinking our foreign
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:55.920]   policy. I think we all agree on that. And the cultural focus on
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.120]   excellence, not excess. This is shaping up to be a little bit of
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.000]   an all in platform here. Great discussion, everybody. Speaking
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.160]   of austerity measures, I think, you know, we should just talk
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.520]   right, right up top here about what's going on at Google. Chris
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.960]   hone, I believe is how you pronounce his name. Chris own,
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:18.080]   he sent a letter to Google and Amazon, Amazon today, after
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.360]   already announcing 10,000 layoffs. They just said again,
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.120]   and he said, prepare for more layoffs in 2023. And these are
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.840]   not factory workers. These are white collar, high paying jobs
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.360]   that are being laid off here. There's surplus elites, plus
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:38.800]   elites. It is definitely a part of the zeitgeist right now. So
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.600]   they're going to reduce headcount massively. But in this
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.880]   letter to shareholders, he points out, notably, not just
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.040]   hey, Google needs to do a riff a reduction in force. But he
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.440]   points out a more granular point that I want the panel to talk
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.480]   about here, which is, he says, Hey, you need to reduce the
[00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:02.680]   actual salaries at Google, the average salary being $296,000 67%
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.520]   higher than an incredibly well paying workforce, Microsoft
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.120]   quote, we acknowledge that alphabet employs some of the
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.000]   most talented and brightest computer scientists and
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.240]   engineers. But these represent only a fraction of the employee
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.720]   base, many employees are performing general sales
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.400]   marketing and administrative jobs, who should be compensated
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   in line with other technology companies. And he says we need
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.960]   to establish an EBITDA margin target, as you can see in this
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.320]   chart, and reduce the losses on other bets, perhaps increasing
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.840]   share buybacks as well. So what we're looking at here. Now after
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.880]   what an incredible business, my god, I mean, the business is
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.160]   nuts. freeberg, you worked there, what in this rings true
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:52.040]   to you? Or not? And then how many people does Google need to
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.640]   employ to operate the business and invest in the future of the
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.560]   business in your mind, they have 187,000 employees at Google.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:09.720]   It's grown 24.5% rounded up 25% year over year, they grew 25%
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.920]   year over year in their business. How many people need
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.160]   to run this business to have it aggressively grow?
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:23.200]   Look, I think there are two main drivers of the issue that
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.760]   Google maybe meta, maybe Twitter, prior to Elon's
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.280]   involvement, and really Silicon Valley as a whole, the bigger
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.400]   companies have faced the first is the war for talent. The war
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.200]   for talent started, I mentioned this last time around 2004 2005.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.600]   Because prior to that, there weren't as many grads coming out
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.880]   of undergrad with computer science degrees, right? I think
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:51.280]   10% of grads in the Bay Area schools were finishing with
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.360]   computer science degrees. Today, the numbers like 60%. So you
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.520]   know, around that time, the war for talent led organizations,
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.600]   particularly Google down a path of offering more perks and
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.480]   benefits to their employees to create a workplace that was more
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.400]   competitive. And that ends up being a slippery slope, because
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.160]   then other organizations try and find parity, and then other
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.080]   organizations try and overdo it and push it even further. So
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.760]   this leads to both wage inflation across the, the
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:28.040]   but it's also led to almost like the acceptance or the allowance
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.640]   for degrees of complacency. And so I'm not saying that the
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.800]   workforce is all complacent. But I do think that complacency is
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.520]   forgiven some amount of complacency, I'm going to take a
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.360]   Friday off, I'm going to take two Fridays off, all of a sudden
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.920]   I'm not working any Fridays. The other thing that's happened is
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.160]   as this workforce has aged. I worked at Google 20 years ago.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.000]   And a lot of the folks I work with almost all of them now have
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.120]   families at the time, everyone was young. And as the
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.720]   demographics of Silicon Valley has matured, you have more
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.800]   people that are less about killing themselves and giving
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.320]   everything that they have to their organization. And they're
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.320]   more interested in being with their families and now spending
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.440]   less time at work, especially in light of the fact that
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.000]   compensation has ballooned to a point that you can now live a
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.360]   very, very comfortable lifestyle. And you don't need to
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.160]   have a big payday in order to be able to take really good care of
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.880]   your family, which was the case as a startup. And then the other
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.720]   issue is just one of innovation. At Google, if you work on a new
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.360]   project, and it doesn't work, there's no loss, you still have
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.960]   your job. And they've started programs, or they'll give you
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.520]   equity and new startup ideas, or they'll give you all this stuff.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.160]   So they'll give you upside if you win, they'll give you bonuses
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.680]   if it succeeds, but there's no downside. And so the pain and the
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.320]   burn that you would feel as a startup founder, or as someone
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.400]   building a new business isn't experienced or realized. And I
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.120]   cannot I don't need to tell you guys this. But for anyone else
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.120]   that's listening that may not really be fully aware, the lack
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.120]   of pain, the lack of risk, the lack of downside, the lack of
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.200]   having no safety net and, and falling through the pits removes
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.040]   all so much of the incentive to succeed, and to drive and to
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.820]   innovate. And I think that's become part of the complacency
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.360]   problem. That's caused larger organizations to simply say,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.600]   let's throw more heads at the problem. And when you just throw
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.400]   more heads at the problem, you have more of kind of talent war
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.160]   problem that I mentioned number one,
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.840]   what is the average salary? 280,000 300,000 rounded up.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.200]   That doesn't cloud I don't know if that includes benefits,
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.720]   whatever, let's just call it 300,000. Yeah.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.680]   And by the way, that doesn't mean that those people should
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.940]   all get fired. But I know it speak it speaks to the fact I
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.020]   think they're wonderful people. They're some of my best friends
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.600]   work at Google. It's a great organization. People do
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.780]   incredible work there. But in terms of return of dollars
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.040]   invested as a shareholder, that's the question. That's the
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.800]   that's the analysis. That's the scope that the shareholder is
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.560]   looking at is do I want to spend $1 to make $1 five? Or do I only
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.520]   want to spend $1 where I know I'm going to get $1 80 back. And
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.760]   so if you just bucketed where the dollars are going, you would
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.800]   end up saying you know what, I'd rather just focus on the places
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.720]   where I spend $1 and I get $2 back or $1 80 back. And I don't
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   want to do any of the stuff where I spend $1 make $1 five
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.600]   back. And that's called ROIC or return on invested capital. And
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.780]   that includes return on invested human capital. And so the
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.760]   analyst in the stock that that's an investor in the stock will
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   look at it through that lens. Whereas everyone that's working
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.880]   there is still contributing meaningfully, they're still
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.600]   doing valuable work. But in terms of return on invested
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.240]   capital, a good chunk of the projects are not driving the
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.920]   majority of the value a minority of the projects and minority of
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.000]   the headcount is driving almost all the value.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.320]   I mean, if you sensitize that to what you said, David, a, if it
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.840]   was just 75, or a half that number, then you know, the stock
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.320]   goes up 35% overnight. And if it goes up to the full number,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.080]   yep, the stock goes up 65% overnight.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.000]   I think that's totally feasible. And then and then I think what
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.280]   you do is you take $10 billion a year, and you have a high
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.960]   accountability model that you speak to the street about. And
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.080]   you say, here's how we're going to hold ourselves accountable to
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.760]   investing this $10 billion every year, and not just have
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.080]   everything be a nebulous 15 year project. And then it's always a
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.000]   15 year project. And you're always just burning cash to go
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.720]   after those projects that are highly nebulous.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.520]   If you had to steel man the other side, I think the
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.440]   argument would be I would say they would make probably three
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.920]   arguments. argument number one is like, Look, don't get overly
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.840]   distracted by other bets, because it's a small category of
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.400]   spend. And we've contained that cost pretty rationally, relative
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.120]   to the rest of the core business. The second thing that
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.040]   they would probably say is, there's an enormous amount of
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.280]   work that is never seen by Wall Street that explains how good
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.640]   our services, whether that's, you know, in early iterations of,
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.200]   you know, technical capability, like GFS and Big Table to things
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.800]   like TPU, two things like TensorFlow. And all of that
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.640]   builds up all the things that DeepMind does all the compute we
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.880]   have to throw against search to support that. So I think they
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.000]   would probably say, well, people probably don't have a great
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.120]   sense of today, that it's not just 25% of the team that's
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.400]   required. And then the third thing is what they would
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.320]   probably say is, it's very hard to explain, but Google has all
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.120]   kinds of other things that they do for free, to create the
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.280]   ecosystem so that the internet works well. You know, I heard
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.880]   this one thing where somebody was explaining that Google is
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.280]   like, you know, the DNS server, right? Google is the time server
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.320]   and all of this stuff they do for free. And all of it is just
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.520]   about making the internet work more efficiently. And that has
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.240]   some cost. So that's probably how they would steel man how to
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.560]   build back up to some number. But it's probably there's still
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.800]   a gap between that number, David and what the prevailing head
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.320]   count is.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.560]   Yeah, I think I think that's, that's totally true. Because the
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.640]   infrastructure team led by ours is the most remarkable
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.800]   engineering organization on planet Earth, in my opinion. And
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.560]   they have laid fiber lines across the Atlantic, they have
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.160]   built their own data center infrastructure, their own
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   switches, their own silicon, like everything is built by this
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.560]   team from the ground up from first principles, and it gives
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.240]   extraordinary moats and advantages to the business, it
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.560]   makes the internet a better place, it allows, you know,
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.440]   ultra fast, super cheap YouTube video viewing across the
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.520]   internet. I mean, there's just so much of these core advantages
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.680]   in the business. But if you look at the headcount over time, you
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.720]   have to ask yourself the question, you know, how many of
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.920]   these investments that are core are really, you know, captured
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:28.080]   in the headcount that blossomed from 2013 47,000 people so that
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.120]   the business has gone up in headcount by Forex. In the last
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.720]   nine years, one of the things that Jeff Bezos was always so
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.320]   incredible at, and I saw him give a speech on this at one
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.840]   point, Bezos gave a speech that I saw and he said, we are really
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.480]   good at failing. And he showed all these projects that Amazon
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.400]   tried. And he said, we tried a nine, we tried to do our own
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.040]   search, we tried to build our own cell phone, the fire phone,
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.640]   we tried to do this, we tried to do that. When they don't work,
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.040]   we kill them. And when they did work, they became 100 multi
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.960]   hundred billion dollar enterprise value creators for
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.040]   them, like AWS, which was one of these projects. And so Amazon
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.760]   was so good at taking the stuff that wasn't working, knowing
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.080]   when it wasn't working and ending it, and they were still
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.960]   able to drive an innovation engine. One of the challenges I
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.240]   see with alphabet is that they are so good at bringing the best
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.480]   talent to work on these innovation problems. But where
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.080]   they're not good is saying, you know what, this isn't working,
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.040]   it's time to move on. And if they did just that, if they
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.280]   added that one disciplinary capability, then I think this,
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.920]   as you said, the market cap would go up by $600 billion.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.720]   What about this? I just want your reaction to this thing that
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.800]   a lot of people whisper in Silicon Valley, which is part of
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.600]   what the big companies should do. It's part of the positive
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.920]   game theory is to not let these talented people actually leave,
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.360]   it's better to pay them 300,000 or 200,000 or whatever, and stay
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.080]   at Microsoft and meta. And Google or whatnot, then go off
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.440]   and start up, build a startup that could actually then disrupt
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.960]   them. And so you know, it's it's a cost worth bearing, because
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   it's actually mitigating strategy as it's called
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.520]   strategy. Yeah. But you think about that super, super
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.320]   interesting idea. I think that the people that are likely going
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.920]   to actually be able to execute on that are going to leave and
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.520]   do it anyway. Right? They're surely aggressive
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.840]   entrepreneurs are not going to be
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.160]   look, I was not super I had made a little money when I worked at
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.440]   Google. But I was not super wealthy. And I left the last the
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.160]   vast majority of my stock options and RSUs on the table
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.120]   when I left Google in 2006. Here's our climate core, because
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.520]   I could not help but do that. I could not help myself. I had to
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.840]   go do that thing. Of course, I think the kinds of people that
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.880]   are going to succeed in entrepreneurism cannot help
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.520]   themselves. It doesn't matter how much money is being thrown
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.200]   at them. Here's the chart. Basically, these companies have
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.720]   been correlating their spend and their headcount to their
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.280]   revenue, not what's necessary. You look at alphabet total
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.120]   employee change since 2018 95.36%. I mean, I don't know that
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:00.560]   looks pretty good to revenue. 132%. It doesn't look like they
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.880]   were massively overhiring if you ask me. Totally. Totally. So
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.080]   what are you guys talking about? So maybe I'm wrong. I will say
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.520]   look, a big part of Larry pages decision to shift the company
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.560]   from Google to alphabet was he believed that the core business
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.920]   at some point would ultimately be disrupted that the core
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.160]   advertising engine was going to be disrupted. And there wasn't
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.480]   going to be the sustaining long term growth advantage in that
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.000]   business. Maybe he's been disproven. Or maybe the it
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.280]   hasn't been just it hasn't been proven yet. But the concept was
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.000]   we need to find the next Google. And we need to build the next
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.360]   Google. And so we want to allocate capital within a
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.840]   portfolio of bets, and have some number of those things, maybe
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.040]   not all of them, maybe not even a lot of them, maybe just one or
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.920]   two of them turn into the next $100 billion revenue line for
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.200]   us. Now, he always said that that's going to take a long
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.400]   time, he definitely
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.720]   underestimated the quality of Google search and the dominance
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.800]   of it. Now, it's probably it probably stands to reason that
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.160]   if we have enough innovation at the fundamental model level in
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.520]   AI, particularly like a bunch of really powerful multimodal
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.240]   models, the new form of search can disrupt Google. But the
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.400]   problem is, they are so ahead of everybody else with respect to
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.440]   those models as well. So the real question is, even that next
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.320]   big leapfrog isn't going to happen without billions of
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.600]   dollars of capital invested. And you know, the most likely folks
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.880]   that are able to do it, I think open AI at some level, but
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.120]   again, they're going to always have to raise money from other
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.800]   folks. Google can self fund it, and it makes an enormous amount
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.600]   of sense to drive that technical mode. So it just seems like
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.320]   Larry, what are we going to happen here? Any? Are they going
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.600]   to make the cuts or not? You think they'll make do they have
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.880]   the ability to not make cuts and just ignore a 6% shareholder
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.480]   Chamath? Or are they just going to make them and then we're
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.080]   going to go on to you?
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.880]   I'll tell you the dynamic, the dynamic will be how much Ruth is
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.760]   able to convey report is the CFO. And she's hardcore.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.720]   She's hardcore. She's incredibly everyone on that leadership
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.680]   team is incredibly impressive. But she has a very particular
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.120]   lens, a Wall Street lens, and she understands what the
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.720]   shareholders are thinking and looking at. And she will convey
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.360]   these points to the board. And, and there will be engineers and
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.600]   Sundar is an engineer and he will and he's a very good. He's
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.840]   very good at gathering and the different points of view and
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.400]   having balance around this. And he will share his points of view
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.880]   with the board. And I think ultimately, it will come down to
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.160]   my guess is like we just talked about some portfolio allocation
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.400]   decisions, which is how much risk and how much beta how much
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.640]   alpha and do we have the right mix in our portfolio, and it is
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.080]   inevitable, there's going to be some cutting. So I think that
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.840]   there will likely be some reduction.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.640]   5% 10% tank 10,000 employees. That seems like the number that
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.480]   people are going with.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.080]   Yeah, yeah, let's see.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.240]   I guess. Okay, sacks. What's your take on austerity measures
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.120]   and moving to an age of excellence and efficiency, which
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.440]   is happening inside of the tech industry as we speak?
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.760]   I think freeberg's right that these companies could operate a
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.400]   lot more efficiently. I think there's an economic argument
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.920]   there. But I want to up level it and talk about the cultural
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.880]   aspect of this for a second and also bring in to the huge
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.520]   stories this week, the the SBF story, the interviews he did
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.160]   with the New York Times and Vox, and then this hysteria around
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.880]   well, you know, what's happening at Twitter. Look, I think that
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.680]   there's something clearly has hit a nerve here in this last
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.800]   week, where you have all of these employees who have
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.920]   voluntarily left, creating all of this drama. And, you know,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.760]   Antonio Garcia Martinez had a good quote about this. He said,
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.920]   What Yolanda is doing is a revolt by entrepreneurial capital
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.840]   against the professional managerial class regime that
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.440]   otherwise everywhere dominates. And that same PMC, which includes
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.200]   the media is treating it as an act of last measure state.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.440]   There's another version of this that came out a couple weeks
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.920]   ago. And by the way, let's mess just a just means like you're
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.560]   insulting the monarch, the
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:00.240]   insulting the crown. There was a good one here. There's an
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.880]   article on compact magazine a couple weeks ago, where the
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.560]   editor Jeff Schellenberger tweeted, the layoffs at Twitter
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.640]   are no different than what's happening across Silicon Valley.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.120]   But because the ideological antagonism of the professional
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.600]   left to Musk, they make clear what's at stake, the collapse of
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.560]   a jobs program for surplus elites. And then and then
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.000]   there's a great quote from this article, which again,
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.120]   that's so hard hitting.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.800]   I know it's no, it's a deep nerve. I'll get into one
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.240]   differently. Yeah, exactly. So a quote from this article said,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.200]   one of the biggest and least talked about social questions in
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.200]   the West is how to economically provide for our own modern
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.280]   version of Francis impecunious nobles. That is how to prop up
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   high status people who can't really do much economically
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:50.440]   productive work. Wow. I mean, like, this was brutal. Yeah,
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.760]   for now. So I think this is really hitting a nerve because
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.000]   the fundamental quid pro quo of our civilization is that in
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.040]   order to achieve economic and social advancement, you go to
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.480]   college and get a degree and you submit to voluntary re
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.520]   education of yourself at one of these woke madrasas, one of
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.920]   these re education camps, that's a good pro quo. You get some
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.760]   people did your punch up guy right that intro? No,
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.480]   this is this is what I believe for a while now. There are some
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.080]   number of people who get useful degrees like computer science or
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.040]   engineering, but huge numbers of people get degrees in like we
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.120]   talked about the basket weaving or whatever the politically
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.480]   correct degree is. And they graduate with a million dollars
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.880]   in debt and no marketable skills, right? And right. And
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.080]   what was propping up all of these people were these
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.800]   fantastically wealthy monopolies, tech companies that
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.800]   were hiring huge numbers of these people. Now all of a
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.320]   sudden, we get to a point where we're in an economic recession.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.960]   And these companies are starting to do layoffs, and they're
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.960]   starting to do a little bit more soul searching about who's
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.480]   really adding value. And people are starting to get laid off.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.880]   And I think this hysteria is coming from a place of deep
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.560]   insecurity. You had all these people go to college, they did
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.240]   not learn critical thinking skills. What they learned was
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.200]   that, listen, if we pay lip service to the right platitudes,
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.080]   then we will have career advancement. And now they're
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.040]   learning that that may not be true. And actually, the person
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.120]   who's pulled the mask off this entire regime is not other than
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.840]   SPF. And he did it in an interview with Vox, and we have
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:38.200]   to go to this, okay. He's the devil, but he basically pulled
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.120]   the mask off this whole civilizational quiproquo. That
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.840]   is a sham. Okay. And here's what he said, that the Vox reporter
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.120]   said, you were really good about talking about ethics for someone
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   who kind of saw it all as a game with winners and losers. What
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.680]   did SPF said? Yeah, he he, I had to be. It's what reputations are
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.000]   made of to some extent. I feel bad for those who get fucked by
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.040]   it. Basically all these people who incurred a quarter million
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.800]   dollars in debt and think they can just spouse the right
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.240]   platitudes. He says, by this dumb game, we woke Westerners
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.160]   play where we say all the right shibboleths, so everyone likes
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.960]   us. How stupid does the New York Times feel right now? How
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.120]   stupid do all these nonprofits and foundations who received all
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.320]   this money from SPF, he played them, all he had to do was say
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.720]   the right words that say the magic woke words, and they would
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.200]   basically cover for the most enormous grift that's ever been
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.360]   perpetrated. That is basically the quiproquo of our
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:43.160]   civilization is be woke and you will have indefinite career
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.040]   opportunities no matter how, how
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.680]   virtuous signaling would be another way to say it. I mean,
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.960]   it doesn't necessarily have to be the work woke ideology, but
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.120]   virtue signal and give donations to people. This has been a
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.920]   playbook of grifters for a long time. Bernie Madoff gave a ton
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.680]   of, you know, donations, and he used the same donations that he
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.520]   gives the Republican Party. None. They're not part of the
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.240]   regime. How many how many conservative? Yeah, I'm not sure
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.840]   this is a lot. I'm not making a political point. I'm making a
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.600]   cultural point. Okay, who were the charities that he donated to
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.880]   it was all the right what causes not, you know, it was not
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.960]   demic one was not woke. He was passionate about the pandemic
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.360]   stuff. Are you kidding me? freaking out about the pandemic?
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.600]   No, no, he wanted to have a pandemic.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.520]   As he explained it to me, the neurosis it was the No, no, no,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.960]   that was not what he was funding. Sax. He I actually
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.920]   talked to him about this when I interviewed him. He said he
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.320]   wanted to do pandemic prevention and early warning systems and
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.720]   wanted to invest in strategies to fight the next.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.880]   And definitely freaking out about COVID is was a central
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.680]   neurosis of the professional managerial class for the last
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.280]   couple of years. It is not what he was funding. I just want to
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.880]   make that point. Yeah. Whatever. I mean, you want to do
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.000]   prevention. I mean, you can frame it as not but I actually
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.920]   literally talked to him about it. He wanted to do pandemic
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.680]   prevention in the future.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.160]   He wants to steal money from California taxpayers via ballot
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.800]   initiative to fund his brother's organization, which would have
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.240]   disbursed the money in who knows what ways, probably not
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:16.120]   legitimate, out of a professed concern about the next pandemic.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.080]   Why? Because the PMC is neurotic about the last pandemic. Come
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:20.800]   on. This is
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.440]   you're saying to them I understand. Of course. Yes,
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.480]   thank you. It's pandering. I understand. It's absolutely
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.200]   pandering. Now listen, why? Well, hold on. Why did this
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.080]   work? Why did this work virtue signaling work? And again, why
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.360]   were they only charities and causes that appeal to the sort
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.520]   of the left is because they're the ones with the power in our
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.480]   society and in our culture to define what virtue is. When
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.920]   you're virtue signaling, who are you signaling to the people with
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.440]   the power to decide what is virtue? And what is vice, right?
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.000]   That is why people go to work at the New York Times. That is why
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.120]   they basically go into, you know, all these influential jobs
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.160]   at nonprofits and foundations. They're the ones deciding what
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.440]   virtue is. They're the dupes, the ones who are fooled. And now
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.000]   what's happening is there's an economic consequence to it,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.920]   which is, it is coming out, these people have no marketable
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.080]   skills, and companies are tightening their belts. And now
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.680]   all of a sudden, they're starting to become deeply
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.880]   insecure about their own future.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.360]   My comment is that, you know, when you look at Twitter, as an
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.240]   example, Bill Gurley had a really powerful quote as well,
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.040]   which is when companies cut, you know, they don't cut nearly
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.080]   enough, and they and they miss estimate and underestimate how
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.520]   resilient a company is back in, you know, Twitter had 200
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.400]   million ma you, they had only 1000 employees. And so clearly,
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.360]   at that point, they knew what they were doing. And now the
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.640]   business has, you know, increased in ma you by call it
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:45.480]   50% to 300 million. But the employee base increased by seven
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.560]   and a half x. So clearly, something is misaligned. And I
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.520]   think the thing that you know, people are going to find out is
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.000]   by the way, with contractors, probably 12 x, right. So I think
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.360]   that, well, there you go. So I think that the thing that
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:03.360]   frustrates a lot of folks that are leaving or that are trying
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.000]   to throw bombs is they don't want Elon to be right. Because I
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.640]   think to David's point, if Elon is successful, he has uncovered
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   this very uncomfortable truth that was frankly hiding in plain
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.680]   sight, which is that many of these technology companies using
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.880]   technology, get so much operational leverage, that they
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.520]   have some enormous efficiencies. And then it's only a decision by
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.600]   the professional managerial class to reward themselves with
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.000]   fiefdoms, and kingdoms of employees and you know, the
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   surfs that work for them. I mean, it's really quite crazy if
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:40.680]   you think about it.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.000]   Well, freeberg made this, you know, early on in the history of
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.680]   this podcast. Well, hold on, I'm going to add to your position.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.920]   freeberg said something that adds to your position, which is
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.000]   early in this podcast, he said the nature of organizations is
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.600]   they want to grow. And that's government or even these
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.640]   departments you're talking about. Anybody who runs a
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.440]   department is never going to say my department needs to be 20%
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.320]   less. So we can hit the bottom line, they're gonna say give me
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.640]   20% more because everybody else is getting 20%. Go ahead.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.400]   And then if you if you if you layer in the Charlie monger
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.280]   quote, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.840]   You can understand why because the professional managerial
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.000]   class is rewarded by compensation that is actually
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.200]   independent of dilution. Right? Because if you look at these
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.880]   compensation plans, all of these professional stock owners, they
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.760]   complain all the time about stock based comp, right. And
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.400]   these companies have budgets between two and 5% a year that
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.360]   they give away. And so you have this situation where an
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.520]   engineer or an engineering manager or a sales manager or a
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.920]   marketing manager, in success at 1000 people can grow to 5000 or
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.960]   10,000, their compensation doesn't change in any other
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.240]   organization, their compensation would change. Because let's say
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.400]   that it's a percentage of the profits that are distributed
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.640]   unless the company is phenomenally growing. Eventually,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.160]   you'll see it in the bottom line of what you take home. And so
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.280]   these folks are incentivized to have these status signals of
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.680]   value. I have a 50 you know, you guys have heard this. I have 50
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.240]   person team. I have 100% I oversee 3500 employees and you
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.640]   and everybody is conditioned to think, Oh my god, that's
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:21.120]   incredible. You must be really important. And so we're going to
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.720]   sort of now see in real time, a questioning of that belief
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.920]   system. And if Elon proves to be right, it's a really important
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.080]   decision point for a lot of other technology companies.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:36.680]   Because if you are an 80 to 90% gross margin business, built on
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.640]   software, maybe you have a bigger responsibility than
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.000]   you've discovered to date to your shareholders and to the
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.640]   existing employees to find the efficient rate of return, right?
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:51.240]   What is the efficient frontier of headcount? The other thing
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.320]   is, it now allows let's just say that now, Twitter goes to a
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.480]   making up a number 2000 employees after this whole
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.520]   Google Form thing. The great thing about the 2001st employee
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.480]   for the 2000 employees and for the shareholders is that that
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.720]   2001st new employee is 100% aligned because they're coming
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.200]   into something eyes wide open. And I think that that's also an
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.960]   interesting thing that isn't getting enough recognition is
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.400]   he's putting out there what he stands for this hardcore culture,
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.640]   irrespective of whether we think it's right or wrong, all the
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.240]   people that stay are voting that it's right. And you know, as
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.040]   long as it's not breaking any laws, he's allowed to do that.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.920]   And so if people now want to join that organization, they
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.000]   should be allowed to do that too, just like the people who
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.320]   don't want to should be allowed to leave
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.440]   sacks, you and I came up and we talked about this, I think on
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.520]   last week's show, or maybe it was two weeks ago, we talked
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.840]   about what the expectation was in Silicon Valley at a startup
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.280]   what startup culture was, in terms of just the effort that
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.560]   was required to build a winning company. And we all said 60
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.520]   hours a week was the baseline. That's something that, you know,
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.160]   has been I think a lot of people you mentioned this trim off
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.760]   people working two jobs for 30 hours a week and taking two
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.720]   salaries from two of the fine companies.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.680]   10 episodes, go into tik tok, and search for you know,
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.600]   engineering salaries, you'll see some of the craziest tiktok
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.040]   videos kids are making 350 k, working 30 hours a week. It's
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:16.760]   nuts. Yeah.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.600]   And so I think we're gonna have is a I think we're gonna have a
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.440]   cultural divide here, there are going to be a series of
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.160]   companies that say this is classic Silicon Valley, we're
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.160]   gonna we're gonna crush it, we're gonna work aggressively,
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.120]   we're gonna put in 50 6070 hours a week, and we're all going to
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.960]   benefit from that. And then there'll be another class of
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.280]   companies that says, Hey, no, we want to have a more lifestyle
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.960]   business. And if people want to work 3040 hours a week, and they
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.600]   contribute, we don't need to be perfectly efficient. And you
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.560]   know, the playing field of the playing field of capitalism will
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.680]   show who is right, sex.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.680]   Yeah, I mean, look, I actually went out of town a few days ago.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.520]   So I wasn't keeping up with, you know, every detail of what was
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.360]   happening at Twitter. And I started getting all these text
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.080]   messages about how Twitter was dead or dying or whatever, like
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   the site had been unplugged, or what have you. And I'm like,
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.720]   what is going on? And you know, you tweeted this morning, hey,
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.360]   is this working? And I'm like, yeah, like, like, yes, it's
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.120]   working. Like, and
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.920]   it's working. And so what we went through?
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.040]   Yeah, so I came to learn what they're talking about is that
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.400]   all Ilan did was give a voluntary offer that if you
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.600]   didn't want to stay, you could take three months severance. Now,
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.640]   remember, last week, they had a riff, you know, which was
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.920]   basically economically required, in which they gave employees
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.720]   three months severance, which is 50% more than what he had to it
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:34.520]   was generous. Now, it seems to me that what if you're one of
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.600]   the employees in the other half that made the cut, but yet
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.200]   you're not really motivated to stay. And maybe you don't really
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.240]   want to operate like a startup. I mean, Elon's basically saying
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.960]   we're going to go back to working and operating like a
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.480]   startup. That means that you might have to work nights and
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.680]   weekends, like a startup. What if that's not what you signed up
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.440]   for? You may be sitting there at Twitter, saying, Oh, man, I wish
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.040]   I gotten riff. Well, now Elon is offering you the opportunity to
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.840]   take the same package. So I'm like, how can this possibly be a
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.880]   bad thing? It's actually the great management technique that
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.000]   Tony Shay rest in peace from Zappos created, he would say
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.640]   when people went through their first couple of months of
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.680]   training, he'd say, Now, if you don't want this job, I will pay
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.960]   you a month's salary. This is on their first day after they went
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.400]   through training their first like day on the job. He said,
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.640]   Okay, now that you've gone through the training, I'll pay
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.520]   you I think it was $5,000 or $3,000 to not take the job. And
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.140]   something like one out of five people would do it. And so he
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.920]   said, Listen, I don't have to fire them later on, this is
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.440]   going to make my management easier. It was it's it is
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.960]   actually a kind thing to do to give people the opportunity to
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:40.320]   leave
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.320]   how giving employees an option to
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.040]   opt out.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.960]   The reason people are upset, let's be honest, sex is some
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.800]   people, you know, live to work and some people work to live and
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:58.560]   the people who are working to live, find it crazy that hustle
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.160]   culture even exists. And people who are part of hustle culture,
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.560]   like the four people in this podcast,
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.200]   find it crazy, it's just working. hustle culture is
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.920]   working above the hours you're being paid for. That's that's
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.800]   basically what hustle culture. That's how you're getting paid.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.280]   That's how most people would define it.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.280]   A salary is actually not you work for 40 hours. A salary
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:17.720]   means you get your job done.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.560]   Okay, that's how we look at it. That is not how other people
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.520]   look at it. And you'll say, Oh, my God,
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.400]   there's no question that Elon is going to raise
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.720]   the bar. If we lose American primacy, it's because of that.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.280]   Not because of
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.880]   I agree with you. I'm just give me the other side. I'm still
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.640]   meeting the other side. People look at their salary. And they
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.400]   look at themselves as getting compensated for 40 hours and
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.480]   every hour above that. But do you know this generation's mind
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.680]   looks as hustle culture. There are people that are not agreeing
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.720]   with it. There are people that are working 6070 80 hours a
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.880]   week as a teacher to make 3040 k firefighters, you know, working
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:56.800]   on oil rigs and to hear somebody like hustle culture at a
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.800]   startup where you're making 350 grand and you're upset because
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.160]   like the matcha lot ran out or whatever. It's just so out of
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.360]   touch. I'm not disagreeing. Yeah, look,
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.480]   my view on it is that people need to love their jobs and love
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.520]   what they're working on. Because I think the only way to be
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:15.120]   successful is to work hard. But the only way to work hard and be
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.160]   happy is to really love what you're doing. And if there's a
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.280]   lot of people at this company or others who don't really love it,
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:25.320]   and they are just there to pay the bills or whatever, then I
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.600]   actually think it's extremely generous for Elon to be
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.120]   offering them a package the right thing to do. I don't
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.440]   understand how giving them an option was anything but
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.800]   positive. And yet the media has gone berserk on it. Meanwhile,
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:41.240]   while giving SBS a virtual pass on the largest one of the
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.840]   largest frauds in history and made off level fraud. You read
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:47.720]   the New York Times legend. No, there's no alleged dude. It's
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.680]   come out he loaned himself like this is just one data point. He
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.000]   loaned himself a billion dollars. And he loaned the head
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.840]   of engineering $500 million off the balance sheet, nothing to
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.480]   see here, what possible justification. And you know, an
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:58.960]   SPF.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:02.160]   And the reason just say the word to say the hard part out loud.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.480]   The reason why these same publications are not covering
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.720]   this is because they were complicit in his reputation
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.760]   laundering. Yes, the New York Times before that article put
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:14.560]   out this other puff piece where they talked to him. And they
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.520]   were excoriated on Twitter, because it was like not a single
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.400]   question about the fraud, or alleged fraud, alleged,
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.320]   allegedly,
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:22.680]   a fraud,
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:28.600]   billion dollars suddenly goes missing and no one knows where
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.920]   it is. I'm willing just to call that a fraud.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.400]   You're willing to jump the fence. They're busy scrambling
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.880]   to sort of save their own reputations, which is why they
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.920]   are trying to like, hide the cheese effectively and point
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.720]   over here and say, Hey, look at what's happening. Elon sent an
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.840]   email worth only one button. Yes.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:47.880]   I mean, let's be
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.040]   intellectually. I love that meme that Elon tweeted out. Do you
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.080]   see that the two rhinos?
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.000]   No, no, please. No, it cracked me up.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:00.440]   You know, this is all gonna get reblogged.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:04.560]   It's too funny. It's just too funny. It's too good.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.280]   It's too good to not put up on the screen.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.760]   I mean, that's that nature photographer is the New York
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:09.960]   Times. It's
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:14.040]   okay. Yeah, people who don't see it. There are two rhinos.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   They're fornicating copy. Yeah, they're copying. But right now
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.640]   for calculating is like it's to 2000 pound animals. populating
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.080]   doggy style 10 feet behind a nature.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:32.480]   Behind I'm trying to be the world's major photographer, a
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:36.840]   nature photographer with a $6,000 telephoto lens that
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.960]   like to like the entire set again. But he's 10 feet behind
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.800]   him are the two rhinos. The two rhinos that says FT x losing
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:49.000]   over a billion dollars in client funds. And the the photographer
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.360]   is senators calling for the FTC to investigate.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.080]   But the important thing is the photographer is pointing in
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.280]   completely the wrong direction.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:59.680]   The thing that is obviously right in front of his face,
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.520]   right that he should be photographing. Yes, he's using
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:06.000]   that long telephone. And that is that is the New York Times that
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.360]   one or Warren that's the point C.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.440]   It's the arrow in the right direction. Yes, point the camera
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.000]   in the right direction is the point. I just want to point out
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.600]   my one Bology tweet on this in this regard. Oh, God.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.120]   Bology is not capable of one tweet. That's gonna be 76 tweets
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:21.520]   in a store.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.120]   You're right.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.680]   Of course, it's a treat service. Bology says, think of a regulator
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:30.320]   as a binary classifier. What's their false positive and false
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:36.600]   negative rate? BTF, Bitcoin ETF block for years, FT x ignored
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.440]   for years. The actual filter is not. Is this a scam? The actual
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.040]   filter is, is this a scam? Who's spicy? It's not consumer
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.840]   protection. It's reelection.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.360]   It rhymes.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.280]   Young Spielberg make a banger out of that. It is a banger.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.720]   It's not consumer protection. It's reelected. And if you are
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.280]   part of these interlocking power structures that we call the
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.840]   regime, it's the New York Times, it's the regulatory state, it's
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.560]   a democratic party, you get a big
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.120]   public and hold on, let's be clear, your, your team now
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.520]   controls the house. And so, whose team? David? Oh, David
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.440]   Sim. David, I understand. But starting in January, you know,
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:20.400]   there's any amount of congressional oversight.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.840]   How's your Hunter Biden investigation?
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.680]   Such a month.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:27.880]   No, no, hold on a second. Let me say this right now. The first
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.880]   investigation by the House of Representatives needs to be SPF
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.000]   and FTX, not honor Biden. SPF makes underbind look like a
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.920]   piker. I mean, yeah, you know, 100 by and was what a couple
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.160]   million dollars of grift. This is $10 billion plus a grift. So I
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:42.320]   think
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.960]   it also touches regulators, it could touch, you know, it's a
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:48.480]   big it's a big failure. It's a system.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.120]   Biden knows how to party. So let's be honest here. I mean,
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.000]   that is the issue. I just think the quote of the week goes to
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:00.560]   john j. Ray. He's FTX his new CEO, he famously oversaw the
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:05.200]   liquidation of Enron. And he says I have over 40 years of
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.160]   legal and restructuring experience. I have been the
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.760]   chief restructuring officer and or chief executive officer in
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.000]   several of the largest corporate failures in history. I have
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.080]   supervised situations involving allegations of criminal activity
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.840]   and malfeasance and run. Nearly every situation in which I have
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.040]   been involved has been characterized by deficits of
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.600]   some sort in internal controls, regulatory compliance, human
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.440]   resources, systematic. Never in my career. Have I seen such a
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.400]   complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.000]   absence of trustworthy financial information has occurred here.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.240]   This is the person who oversaw Enron saying this is
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:45.520]   unprecedented. And Ron was the previous unprecedented situation,
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.920]   which is now being framed as manageable by none other than
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.920]   john j. Ray, what a great name. Congratulations on being the
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.720]   chief restructuring officer of FTX. There was an article that
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.120]   showed Nick, if you could please throw the picture up on the
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.440]   screen of, of all the people that invested the universe of
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.400]   SPF. And my god, what and they and the article headline was
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.160]   it's a who's who of VC and my comment is actually no this list
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:21.000]   is a who's who of people who did no diligence. Yeah. So ever. And
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.400]   I just want to call one person Nick, if you look at the
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.760]   alimeter research, this, this firm called one inch, J Cal
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:31.840]   invested in a firm named after the length of his penis.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.400]   Maybe coming out of the cold plunge. Okay, but you're that
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.440]   cold plunge the shrinkage. You know, the shrinkage was that an
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:46.840]   SPV. Listen, I'm a shower. Not I'm a grower. Not a shower.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.400]   Alright, listen, you guys coming out. Everybody knows coming out
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.560]   of the cold plunge. It's it's not going to be the best
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.600]   performance for any of us.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:02.120]   We've lost the script on the show. Jesus, please. We got a
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.800]   wrap. I mean, it's just too much.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.120]   Do you guys not think that all these investors receive audited
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.320]   financials? And no, you know, they got they had a lawyer, a
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:10.920]   legal firm.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.760]   Did you guys see who FTX is auditing firm was it's called
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.680]   Frager medicine that says it's based in the metaverse. This is
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.000]   like the Hollywood upstairs Medical College of the auditing
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.240]   world. Their address is in decentral land. Bernie Madoff. I
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.880]   think his brother in law ran the accounting firm that did their
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.480]   audits, right? It was like, and it was a dead floor in the
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.520]   lipstick. It was in the same building, right?
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.920]   On the list. So building to have like a secret floor with no
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.440]   priority.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.000]   Look, I mean, even in that case, people relied on an audit from a
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.840]   CPA that said, Here are the numbers. And those numbers were
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.560]   fraudulently conveyed. And I think that there's probably some
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:48.160]   you know, some forgiveness necessary here that there was
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.040]   maybe there may have been serious fraud that took place.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.240]   And I don't want to be too disparaging of all the people
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.240]   that we work on this work at these investment firms made an
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.160]   investment and they all got duped and the LPS got duped. And
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.520]   so I don't think this is just fundamentally like a failure of
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:05.080]   diligence. So we we we were part of the process where they tried
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.720]   to show I have to be careful. My lawyers remind me that we're
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.840]   still under NDA actually with FTX. So but what I can tell you
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.680]   is we did not get any financials. So we were verbally
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.160]   when you ask for it when you
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.200]   we sent a two pager of stuff. Anyways, I can't say more than
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:22.600]   that. But don't get yourself in trouble. Oh, I want to I want to
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:27.480]   say something else, by the way. Last Friday, David and I were at
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.440]   URI Milner's birthday party. And there was a chess tournament.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.120]   And Magnus Carlsen was there. And anyways, David was in the
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.880]   finals. Okay, it was David and his partner look at the smile on
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.600]   David versus versus Matt. Hold on. Wait, I'm getting to a great
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.000]   punch line versus Magnus Carlsen and his partner. David one.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.600]   Wow. partner was was should I say Yuri's daughter who I think
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.640]   is probably what like 10 years old. She's incredible. Yeah,
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.080]   she's like second in America. Yeah, she's good. She's good.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.200]   He's incredible. Anyway, yeah, thank you to Yuri. That was a
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.360]   really unique in front of a partner chess. My partner was
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.320]   Pragnananda who's an Indian Grandmaster who's like a
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.160]   superstar. Yeah, and look playing, you know, with Magnus
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.680]   Carlsen was obviously that was a real thrill. Yeah, there you
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:15.160]   go. So when you rank this with the birth of your children, your
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.800]   marriage, and this, where would that rank on the scale of one
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.960]   through five? This is for your kids. But you know what,
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.120]   speaking of the pot is happy. Oh my god, I haven't seen him that
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:31.880]   happy since. Since Trump was look at look at that document I
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.920]   just say a lot before before we got to wrap up but I want to
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.120]   show you this basically I pulled all IPO since 2020. So this
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.960]   excludes all SPAC mergers, and real estate finance material
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:44.520]   energy utilities are kind of the big bulky private equity type
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.320]   stuff. So it's mostly tech consumer 627 IPO since 2020.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.640]   More than half of them are basically half of them are
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.040]   trading at less at point two times the total cash they've
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.440]   burned. So there you know, you can kind of look at total
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.240]   lifetime capital burned by these companies in the retained
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.720]   earnings line on the balance sheet. And so when you pull out
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.880]   the retained earnings, it shows you right how much money they
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.520]   burnt over their lifetime. And so the total money burnt by half
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:17.280]   of these companies is about $107 billion. And the market cap of
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   those companies is only $26 billion in aggregate. So a point
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.520]   two times return on capital invested to date in terms of
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.440]   enterprise value, divided by total capital invested in. Let
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.600]   me say let me say it in English. And you tell me if I said it
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:39.480]   right. So 627 non SPAC non real estate non finance companies
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:43.640]   went public. So basically 627 start companies went public
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.760]   since 2020. So two years. Yep. And of those 627 tech companies,
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:56.320]   almost half or 300 of them 48% of them are today worth about
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.400]   point two times all the money that went into them. Yep. My
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.840]   gosh, wow. Yeah, it's tough. And then on the other half, the
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:09.320]   other half is, is the ones that have worked. So this kind of
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.240]   goes back to a power law point. But like as a venture industry,
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.760]   you think once you get a company public, it's successful. And the
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.760]   reality is that many of these companies from a from an
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.520]   economic perspective, are still not successful. It looks like
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.640]   half and perhaps much more if you include all the SPAC
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:31.800]   mergers, which is another couple 100. And I would guess the vast
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.360]   majority of those meet this criteria are trading at less
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.480]   than the total cash that's been invested in them.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.800]   freeberg. This speaks to the age of excess that we just went
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.020]   through. We just weren't as efficient as we needed to be in
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:46.520]   running these companies. And now we're in the age of efficiency,
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:50.880]   austerity, excellence. But it's this great setup for a rebound,
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.480]   isn't it freeberg? Like I don't know.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.040]   Look, I mean, one way to read this, I was speaking with
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.200]   someone who I, you can bleep him out. I was talking with two
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.880]   weeks ago, three weeks ago, and he showed me in there. How much
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.680]   should I say here? This is a big investment firm, and they have a
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.000]   big growth portfolio, less than they have about 160 investments,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.720]   180 investments in their growth portfolio. 85% of the returns
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.520]   are generated by 10 companies of the 180. And that's in the growth
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:24.920]   portfolio. These are supposedly de risk businesses power exists
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.880]   even in our law exists in growth. And as you can see here,
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:32.360]   the power law exists quite dramatically post IPO as well.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:36.240]   So you know, as you can see here, only 9% of these
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.520]   businesses have generated positive earnings over time. 43%
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.880]   about half of them are worth more than the total cash that's
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.720]   been invested in them. And that multiple production board study
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.880]   here, by the way, this is your done by your family. Yeah, yeah,
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:58.160]   yeah, it's all public data. So the, the multiple on the value
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.680]   of the companies that are worth more than their cash invested is
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:06.280]   5.5 times. So in aggregate, IPO since 2020, are worth 4.3 times
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.920]   the total cash that's been invested in them over their
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:12.360]   lifetime. But the crazy statistic is half of them are
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.400]   worth significantly less than the cash that's been invested in
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.200]   them only point two times. So the power law dominates both
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:22.000]   early growth and clearly being public. But I think to your
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.040]   point, Jake, how it also seriously speaks to the amount
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.440]   of excess and it's really going to rationalize probably based on
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.560]   the conversations we had today about Twitter, meta, Google,
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.080]   Amazon, Amazon, and this as well. So certainly,
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.200]   also the good news. Freeberg and correct me if I'm wrong here,
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.920]   tomorrow, we want more companies to go public and have that
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.100]   discipline of being a public company. This was the big
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:48.680]   critique of this quiet era of companies taking 1012 14 years
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.960]   to go public. This is going to be a strength for these
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.360]   entrepreneurs to have to fight it out in the public market
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.520]   under scrutiny. Correct?
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.920]   100% I think like the Chris own letter, I think that there are a
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:03.360]   lot of VCs on boards of companies who would love to say
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:07.560]   the equivalent thing to their private private company. And
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.000]   part of the the dynamics as as freebird just said, because
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.760]   it's such a power law and people believe that, you know, you
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.660]   being with other VCs are really important. It turns out that
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:19.280]   most of these VCs abandoned their role on these boards and
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:20.960]   don't really hold people accountable because they're
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.200]   worried that affect their deal flow. So the problem is, it's a
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.160]   negative reflexive loop. It's but so these companies do
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.240]   poorly. And then as a result, they're viewed as not an
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:32.120]   effective board member. And so the next deal they get is a poor
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.640]   and poor quality. So the highly correlated portfolios in Silicon
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:38.560]   Valley are the ones that will get torched because most of
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:42.960]   those companies will receive very poor or no advice. And then
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.760]   the few that will get to the end is because they have hard nosed
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:50.840]   people on the board that will force them to make really hard
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.440]   decisions. Yeah, that's it.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:56.000]   sacks any thoughts here on the public markets?
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.440]   I'm sorry, wait, last thing. And by the way, Sequoia, who has had
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.560]   exceptional returns has always been known to be hard nosed. You
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.880]   know, a lot of people that critique against Sequoia from
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:06.640]   founders, which would be that, oh, if I take Sequoia's money,
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.000]   they may fire me. Well, yeah, because if you're not good,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.960]   it's the mission of the business is bigger than your ability to
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.880]   be the CEO. And so you know, you just have to remember, like,
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.040]   there is no free lunch, we were not giving out free money here.
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.840]   For you pendulum swung one direction too far. They used to
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.320]   the tradition Silicon Valley used to be you always replace
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.400]   the CEOs, the founders, the founders with a professional CEO
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.280]   and Google being the turning point there, or maybe the last
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.400]   one. And then it became founders will control their companies
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.840]   with super voting shares forever. Hopefully, the pendulum
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.480]   now swings to some equilibrium sex. What are you seeing in
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.240]   private markets?
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.480]   The program for surplus elites is going away.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:54.000]   managerial classes under pressure. Yes, that's for sure.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.680]   If you went woke, you may go broke because you have no
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.880]   marketable skills.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.360]   Man, you're a bunch of
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.320]   these one liners.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.040]   Somebody in the room with
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:06.960]   Dean's
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.360]   myself up.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:12.640]   Who Jackie joke, like Jackie the joke man Marling handing you a
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.480]   little note.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:20.440]   All right for the Sultan of science, David Friedberg and
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.520]   also the executive producer of all in summit 2023.
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.280]   And
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:33.000]   the rain man himself, chess master and champion, David Sacks,
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.320]   as well as the dictator, we're gonna go on a little road trip,
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.960]   aren't we dictator a little road trip for the dictator and Jake
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.520]   out. It's gonna be fun. I am the world's greatest moderator who
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.320]   couldn't control the panel today. I'll do better next week.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.320]   And we'll see you next time.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:49.640]   In podcast. Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:56.160]   Rain Man David
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:02.880]   we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy.
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.080]   Love us.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.760]   I'm the queen of Kinwani
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:13.640]   besties are gone.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.160]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:25.520]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
