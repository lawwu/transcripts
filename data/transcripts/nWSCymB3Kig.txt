[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - Well, welcome back to the podcast on this Wednesday.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.760]   We have often taken up the topic of anger on the podcast.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.440]   And that's because, well, we get a lot of questions
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.280]   on anger to the podcast and hundreds of questions
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.260]   over the years have come in on this topic.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.520]   Last time we looked at one dimension,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.180]   namely getting mad at God when life doesn't turn out
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.380]   the way that we had hoped.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.000]   Is it ever virtuous or righteous or godly or innocent,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   or even morally neutral to feel heartfelt anger at God?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.880]   That question we took up last time on Monday in APJ 1828.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.360]   But most of our emails on anger are in the context
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.280]   of the home, in wondering what Pastor John has said here.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.980]   I searched the sermon archive and found this clip
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.420]   that I wanna play for you today, it's for dads.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.020]   And it's a reminder of how dad's anger in the home kills
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.440]   the kindness and the tenderheartedness
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.860]   that he is called to display to his family.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.640]   So how do we confront such a powerful
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.920]   and seemingly unstoppable force of anger inside the home?
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.960]   Here's Pastor John with a wonderful gospel answer
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.340]   and a clip taken from one of his 2007 sermons.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.640]   Here he is talking about the fatherhood of God.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.420]   - So here he is as our father,
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.200]   and he has never done us wrong or done anything
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.000]   to give us a legitimate cause for anger.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.280]   And the relationship is broken with everybody in the world.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.100]   Whose fault is it?
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.120]   It's man's fault.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's always our fault.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.880]   It's always our fault when the relationship breaks down
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.800]   between us and God, always.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.720]   Now, here's the point of making that.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.680]   Who takes the initiative to fix that?
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.640]   Our Father in heaven does,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.040]   at the price of his son's life.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.360]   This is not a small little,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.080]   well, I'm gonna give it a little try here
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.460]   to see if I can save my children.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.200]   This is the father and the son from all eternity
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.240]   knowing our rebellious anger against him and saying,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   "Son, we're not gonna let him go.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.260]   "We will not let our elect go.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.340]   "We will do everything it takes
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.360]   "to have them in this family and have them happy."
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.580]   Now, I mention it, dads, 'cause that's our pattern.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.920]   And it was all our fault.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.000]   It'll never be all your children's fault
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.080]   when they give you trouble.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.800]   Some, but not all.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   And therefore, the call to be like God to our children
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.840]   will be more warranted than if we were perfect fathers.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   And if we were perfect fathers,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.000]   the knock on the door would be,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080]   "I would like to talk to the man of the house
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.360]   "and we'll work on this.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.000]   "We will lay our lives down to have these children back
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.160]   "and to have them free from anger
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.200]   "and to have them whole emotionally
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.160]   "and moving into their own little nests whole."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.720]   Now, I said I would point you back
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.120]   to the way Paul worked with anger.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.600]   If you wanna move a page,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.880]   you may not have to move a page.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.340]   Chapter four, verse 31.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.560]   This text, 431 to 5.2, is a model for fathers
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   and how to attack the anger in the family,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.320]   in himself, in his children, wife.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.920]   Let's start reading at 431.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   "and clamor and slander be put away from you."
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.740]   You could say you dads.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.800]   "Along with all malice, be kind to one another,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.120]   "tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.320]   Now, stop right there.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.760]   That's all command.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.000]   And as command, powerless.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.440]   You go to a dad who's angry in this church tonight,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.840]   say, "Stop feeling that way."
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.120]   He'll look to you like, "You mean you want me to fly?"
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.200]   "It doesn't work."
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400]   That's what he would say, probably,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.600]   if you just said, "Stop being angry."
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.040]   Or, like Paul, "Put it away."
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.260]   That's powerless.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.120]   But the next phrase is all power.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.080]   "As God in Christ forgave you."
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.960]   There's the only hope, dads.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.880]   The gospel is the only hope for child rearing.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.600]   The main issue in making kids mad is that we're mad.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.960]   And if we're gonna pull the plug on our anger, this is it.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.300]   I don't know any other Christ-exalting answer
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   to how to overcome anger than to do the way Paul says here.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.180]   "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.900]   "and clamor and slander be put away from you."
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.000]   Reverse it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.980]   "Let there be kindness and tenderheartedness."
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.460]   That's those other sweet emotions
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.140]   that are being slaughtered by the anger.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.200]   "Replace the anger with tenderheartedness
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.700]   "and forgiving one another."
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.100]   And then here it comes.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   "As God in Christ forgave you."
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.620]   So the text is God doesn't just come to us, dads,
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.660]   and say, "Stop being angry
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.560]   "and stop provoking your kids to anger, period.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.660]   "I mean it, I'm God, do what I say."
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.900]   That's not the gospel.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.220]   What God says is, "From eternity, I plan to save you.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.220]   "My son and I, in a covenant of redemption, agreed to do it.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.660]   "I'm gonna let him go.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.340]   "He's gonna die.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.020]   "He's gonna rise again."
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.020]   For every dad who will look away from himself to Christ
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.100]   as the punishment he deserves,
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.880]   the righteousness God requires,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   and receive all that precious, glorious treasure,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.440]   at that moment, God says, "I am totally for you forever."
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:52.160]   And out of that forgiveness, out of that right standing,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.120]   out of that sweet, tenderhearted experience
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.760]   of the living God folding me like a father into his family,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   a soul that has shriveled up to one solitary emotion,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:19.840]   anger can begin to melt under the smile of God.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.680]   It can happen.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.160]   It will happen.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.000]   - A hopeful gospel word to address anger in the home.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.320]   I took this clip from a John Piper sermon
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.720]   preached on June 17th, 2007, titled,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.920]   "Marriage is Meant for Making Children
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.100]   "Disciples of Jesus, Part Two."
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.720]   And that sermon is subtitled,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   "A Father's Conquest of Anger in Himself
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.880]   "and in His Children."
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.720]   It's really important.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.280]   You can get the entire thing, both parts, online in audio.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.480]   I think just audio.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.760]   I'm not sure if the video's online.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.800]   I know the audio is.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.160]   Go and check it out online.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.760]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.640]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.600]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.480]   and make a note of what stands out to you in it.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.280]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.800]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.360]   Well, as Pastor John says,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.740]   "Not many things weigh heavier on the heart
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.520]   "than long-term marital disappointment."
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.760]   And we return Friday to hear from a disappointed wife
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.680]   who wants to know how to address
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.280]   the very deep disappointment
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.080]   she faces over her husband's ongoing sin.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.640]   It's a heavy topic and sobering.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.920]   Hit us up on Friday.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.360]   Next time, I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.720]   We are rejoined in the studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
