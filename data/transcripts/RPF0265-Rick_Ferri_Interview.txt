[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   If you're one of those who listens to the show every day when it comes out and if you're
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.280]   current with the show, then you're probably in vacation mode.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.600]   As I record this here, it's Tuesday, November 24, 2015.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.920]   I'm getting ready to pack up and head out of town for Thanksgiving.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.120]   However, let's not check out too early.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   I've got one more heavy lifting show for you.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.480]   Today is going to be a heavy lifting show.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.960]   We're going to get into some meat and potatoes of investing and talk about why index funds,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.760]   fund investing, and passive investing is the only appropriate way for anybody to invest
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:55.920]   ever.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.080]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   And welcome to the show.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.200]   Yes, one more heavy lifting show.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.400]   Let's dig into some meat on investing.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.000]   My guest today is a man named Rick Ferry.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.560]   Rick is a really awesome guy, a very knowledgeable investment manager and financial analyst.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.760]   He is also the founder of a company called Portfolio Solutions.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:27.560]   And today, he's going to give us a master class on investing and asset allocation.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.400]   I was able to connect with Rick recently while I was at the XYPN 15 conference.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.320]   He was a sponsor of that conference in Charlotte, North Carolina a few months ago.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.280]   And while we were there, I connected with him and I was very impressed by him and I
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.560]   thought he would be a great resource for you on the show.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.320]   So if you're in holiday mode and if for you it doesn't seem like fun to talk about investing
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.840]   and index funds and all that stuff, you might want to wait a few days and then check back
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120]   with this next week.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.000]   Otherwise, here's one more heavy lifting show today and then tomorrow, we'll have a light
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.320]   and fun show for you as well.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.800]   Playing interviews this week while I head out of town with my family heading over to
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.080]   Central Florida to hang out with family in Central Florida away from the coast.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.800]   But we'll be back after next week.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.320]   So the show will be off on Thursday and Friday but we should be back on Monday of next week,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   30th of November.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.680]   So let's talk about sponsors right up here at the front and then we'll get to the interview
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.240]   and we will get you in and out today.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.600]   I'll do sponsors quickly.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.880]   Sponsor of the day, number one today is Jay Fleischman.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.040]   Jay is an awesome guy.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920]   He is a student loan and bankruptcy attorney.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.620]   He is also the host of the Student Loan Show podcast and he is a past guest on Radical
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.640]   Personal Finance for two episodes, episodes number 214 and 258.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.280]   If you have student loans, you should call Jay.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.000]   I was talking with somebody on the phone yesterday and he was mentioning that he had student
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.080]   loans and he was a listener of the show and I said, "Have you called Jay?"
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   He said, "No, no, no.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   I hear you talk about that."
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.160]   I said, "Dude, what are you doing?
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160]   Call Jay."
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.320]   I really mean that because it's probably going to be – if you call Jay and/or go to studentloanshow.com/radical,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.480]   sign up at least for Jay's $50 federal student loan review.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.080]   Probably going to be one of the better 50 bucks that you're ever going to spend.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.520]   He is a really knowledgeable guy and he – if there is a loophole that you can find that
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.840]   will help you in your student loan repayment plan to pay them off quicker and to pay them
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.720]   off with less money out of pocket to cut your interest expenses, things like that, Jay is
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.480]   the guy who will help you find that.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   So if you have student loans, go to studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   If you doubt that Jay is the guy who can be worth 50 bucks for a federal consultation
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.320]   – by the way, that's a $25 discount off of his normal rate for listeners of the show.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.800]   If you doubt that, go and listen to episode 214 of the show and then listen to episode
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   258 of the show.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.440]   You'll find them on the website or in your feed and go ahead and listen there and I bet
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   you you won't doubt why I say it's worth it at the end of that.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   Also make sure you subscribe to his podcast, Student Loan Show.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.840]   You can find it in all the major podcast directories.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.040]   Which leads me to sponsor of the day number two is the sponsor that we introduced on yesterday's
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.160]   show, SoFi, Social Finance, S-O-F-I, SoFi.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.400]   If you have student loans and one of the things that you want to look at is can you refinance
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.240]   them at a lower interest rate.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.320]   The reason I led with Jay as a sponsor is you should first consult with Jay and if your
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   option is in the back end to refinance it, he will tell you that and then you should
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.280]   investigate using SoFi.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.720]   You'll find a link, a referral link for me and for you at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.200]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi, S-O-F-I, which is short for again, Social Finance.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   At that link, if you use that link and you refinance your student loans through them,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.760]   you can put an application in line.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.280]   It's very easy, very fast to do and you can find out what your rates would be, see if
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.960]   it would save you some money.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.840]   If you use that link, then I'll get a commission and you'll save 200 bucks.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.120]   You'll get 200 bucks of credit back to your account.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.560]   If you go through that and you want to check into their personal loan refinancing options,
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.800]   you can also find that at that link as well.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.680]   Just go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.000]   Those are our sponsors of the day.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.880]   With that, let's go to the interview.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.560]   Please welcome Mr. Rick Ferry.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.140]   Rick, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.140]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.680]   It's great to be here.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.560]   I owe you an interview on this show since I did my best the other day.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.640]   You were a sponsor of XYPN 15 and I did my best to eat you out of house and home at the
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.920]   Brazilian steakhouse dinner that you provided for us.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   I know.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.840]   I got the bill and they said there was this big guy with a red beard.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   You thought the bill was going to be this, but we had to add another 15% just for him.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   Exactly.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   Well, I quit eating carbohydrates a while ago.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.640]   When you're at a conference like this, it's challenging to find food to do that.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.760]   My strategy is I start by having a big breakfast.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.960]   That day, I'd had a breakfast very early in the morning and then it was all day long.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.160]   We got to the Brazilian steakhouse and I did my best to eat about eight pounds of meat.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.080]   I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   For dinner.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   Let's kick off.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.400]   We're going to talk some finance today and talk about investing.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.680]   You're a real expert.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.940]   Don't be scared to make today a little bit heavy.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.300]   We're not talking necessarily to a mainstream audience here.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.760]   We're talking to people who have an above average interest in finance.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.640]   Start by just sharing with us a little bit about your story and a little bit about your
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.080]   company Portfolio Solutions and what you guys do.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   My story is back in the 1980s when I came into the field, I went into the traditional
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:31.400]   brokerage model and I started using the products that I was told to use.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.480]   What I did was I started analyzing the returns of those products.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:45.560]   As I did that, I began to realize that the returns weren't matching the markets.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:54.640]   I decided that I should go out and educate myself to find out how to manage money so
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.880]   that I could maybe better make better decisions for my clients.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.920]   Then I became a CFA, a charter financial analyst, and got my masters in science and finance.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.680]   I created a lot of analytics to analyze the performance of money managers.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.160]   Try not to hit the table.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   You're good.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   All good?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   All good.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.480]   That's when I began to realize through my research that the money managers were not
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.680]   keeping up with the markets and that the best thing for my clients would be to just use
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.400]   index funds, which were beginning to grow.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.640]   That would have been about what year?
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.000]   That was in the mid-1990s.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.960]   There wasn't the analytics out there.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.000]   There wasn't the research that they have now.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.840]   It was a lot of deep digging and actual experience using these products that got me to this point.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.360]   How painful was that to be selling one thing and then doing your research and questioning
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.560]   that?
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.880]   Before I went into finance, I was in the Marine Corps.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.120]   I flew fighter aircraft.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.080]   I used to land on aircraft carriers.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.240]   When you do that, everything is very precise.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.960]   It is what it is.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:13.880]   There's no joking around about it.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.760]   The facts are the facts and you react to that exactly as they are.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   When I went into the finance industry, I thought that was the way it was.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.400]   You were getting good, clean information and it was beneficial to you and you were able
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   to do your job.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.440]   That's exactly the opposite of that.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.040]   That was a little bit of a reality check of what that was.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.560]   I realized that I had to do what the numbers said, what was reality.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.280]   When I made that decision and had that epiphany, I didn't change my mind.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.360]   I never went back.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:03.600]   I got very angry about what I was seeing and that didn't make me feel good.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.760]   The last few years I was in the brokerage industry, I was miserable.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.160]   I stayed because I had to figure out the plan for how I was going to use this information
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.280]   to help my clients.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   Where did you go from there?
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   I actually started at Kidder Peabody.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:27.560]   It's no longer with us and I went to Smith Barney who is no longer with us.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.120]   I was in it for 10 years.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.960]   In the last three years, I was planning to start my company Portfolio Solutions which
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.520]   did low cost, index-based money management.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.600]   There was nothing out there at the time and I was really one of the first ones, the first
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.200]   person who was going to put an RIA together that just did this.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.120]   Are you serving individual clients or are you serving advisors?
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.640]   For the past 15 years, we were serving individual investors.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.400]   Mostly now, we're serving both individual investors and advisors.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.320]   We're creating the channel to distribute through advisors.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.520]   You are focusing on exclusively passive index funds?
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.280]   Okay, so we're getting into the technical aspect of it.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.800]   Let's talk about that if you mind.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:28.120]   The first thing I do is look at, at one level, what is an asset class and isolate out different
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.120]   asset classes.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.240]   By the way, this is all written in one of my books called All About Asset Allocation.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:43.400]   This is all this information is in one of my books called All About Asset Allocation.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   You start out at the asset class level determining what is an asset class and then which asset
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.120]   classes should you invest in because there are some that you wouldn't invest in because
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.320]   they don't give you a real return or maybe they're not investable.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.960]   Once you come up with the asset classes that are investable, then you find the products
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.880]   that best represent the asset class in a low cost way.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.760]   Now most of the time that points to index funds, but there are times when you may not
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.600]   use an index fund because the asset class is best represented by something that's not
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   an index fund.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:30.160]   I don't know if they give specifics, but let's say high yield bond, part of the market, the
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.280]   best product out there is not an index fund.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.640]   It's actually a low cost actively managed fund.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.000]   I can't get into for compliance purposes what one that is, but I think we all know which
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.680]   one and what big mammoth company out there has that.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.920]   Let's start with answering that question.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.640]   What is an asset class according to your definition?
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.760]   Because it's a term that we throw around a lot of times and as financial advisors, we're
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.600]   great at throwing terms out that people don't actually understand and we're not great at
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   supporting them.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.200]   How do you answer the question?
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   That's a good question.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.240]   Again, two, there are asset classes and then there are the ones that you would want to
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   invest in.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:15.800]   So, you have to look at it and you say, "Is there something unique about this asset class?
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.240]   Is it fundamentally different than another asset class?"
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.200]   For example, bonds are fundamentally different than equity.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.120]   What backs the bonds, how bonds pay you a return, these are all fundamentally different
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   than equity.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.480]   So, equities and bonds are two different asset classes.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.840]   Then you look at something like commodities or precious metals and you say, "What about
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   that?"
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   Well, they're physical.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.240]   The return you get from those is different than the return you get from bonds and the
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.760]   return you get from stocks.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.680]   So you isolate these things out by, "Are they fundamentally different?
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.960]   Do they have fundamentally different risks?
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.040]   How do you measure whether they're fundamentally different risks?"
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:08.080]   I do that through a rolling correlation analysis, not just a correlation analysis, but a rolling
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.520]   correlation analysis.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   What's the difference?
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.640]   Okay, correlation, for example, if you were going to take stocks and bonds and we were
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.480]   going to look back 50 years and we were going to say, "What's the correlation between stocks
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.760]   and bonds?"
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.720]   You did it as one flat 50-year number.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:29.840]   You would come up with something like .1, which means there's not much correlation between
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.200]   stocks and bonds.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.520]   But in fact, the correlation between stocks and bonds is never .1.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.920]   It goes through .1 on occasion, but it's never .1.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.600]   So you have to do a rolling correlation where you're looking at three-year periods of time
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.960]   rolling forward over that 50-year period.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.480]   And then you can see how the correlation between two asset classes shifts.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.840]   Sometimes it's negative, sometimes it's positive.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:05.760]   And that shifting correlation, the variability of the correlation is telling you that there
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:12.720]   are different risks in stocks than there are in bonds because the correlation varies over
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   time.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.440]   You can do the same thing between common stocks and real estate.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.520]   And you can see that the correlation is sometimes negative and sometimes positive, but it shifts
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.760]   over time.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.720]   And therefore, there are different risk factors within those asset classes.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.580]   Same thing with commodities.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.160]   And so you use this to determine, is the asset class fundamentally different?
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.560]   And one test to determine whether the asset class is fundamentally different is whether
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.960]   there are different risks in the asset class.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.240]   And you determine that or you validate that through a rolling correlation analysis.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.920]   So the reason why this is important is from the scientific perspective, when we're constructing
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   a portfolio, the correlation or the correlation coefficient is indicating, do these two asset
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.200]   classes tend to move together or do they tend to move in different directions?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:11.520]   So if you had a stock of Pepsi and a stock of Coca-Cola, those would be highly correlated.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.500]   You would expect them in many ways to move together.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.120]   There might be some variability between the companies, but they're both in similar markets.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.880]   They're going to be subject to similar economic influences.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:28.120]   The idea of, say, stocks and bonds is, well, if stocks go up, do stocks go down?
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   Bonds.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   Excuse me.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   Correct.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120]   Thank you.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   Do bonds go down?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.160]   And when we're integrating a portfolio, a portfolio manager would love to have asset
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   classes that were the exact opposite.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.240]   That if asset class A goes up, asset class always B goes down by the same amount.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.160]   That is brought together mathematically that lowers the total variability, the total risk
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.600]   of the portfolio.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.520]   The problem is those asset classes, there are no asset classes that are perfectly inversely
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.600]   correlated.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.460]   They all have some coefficient between them that sometimes they go up, sometimes they
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.560]   go together.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   And so the goal of why this is important for the listener is you want to have asset classes
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.280]   that you need to understand the correlation between asset classes on this basis, on a
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.800]   year to year basis, or on a market to market basis, so that you can figure out how to construct
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.920]   them together in a portfolio to deliver the maximum return at the minimum level of risk.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.120]   Is that accurate?
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.520]   That's a perfect textbook explanation that doesn't actually exist in reality.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.920]   Okay, but that's right.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.360]   So let's talk about reality then.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.000]   So the reality is, as you said, there are no negatively correlated asset classes, except
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.640]   if you went long the S&P and at the same time shorted the S&P, which gives you a zero return.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.960]   And you got to pay your premiums along the way.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   You have to pay fees.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.040]   So it doesn't make any sense to do that.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:58.680]   The best that you can find is asset classes that are randomly correlated with each other,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.560]   and that at times may be negative and at times positive.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880]   That's really the best you're going to find.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.120]   The problem with that is that sometimes asset classes all go down together, and you can't
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.200]   get away from it unless you have a portion in cash.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.800]   Not that I'm saying you should, but from a portfolio management standpoint, you can have
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.040]   contagion within all asset classes.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.920]   Let's take 2008, for example.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.120]   International stocks, real estate, commodities, everything went down together.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.400]   Stock bonds, high yield bonds, everything went down.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.640]   Treasury bonds were the only thing that did well.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.880]   So whatever portion you actually had in treasuries did well.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.820]   So at that time, you should have had some in treasuries.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.880]   But you say, "Okay, well, I'll always have some in treasuries because they're negatively
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.440]   correlated with stocks."
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.960]   Well, no, not during the late 1990s.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.680]   During the late 1990s, bonds went down and stocks went down.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   Why?
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   Because it's a variable.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.560]   That's why I say you have to look at a rolling correlation as opposed to a point correlation,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.840]   because the rolling correlation will show you that there are times where this will occur.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:15.680]   It's important to not be seduced by modern portfolio theory into thinking that it's a
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.600]   safe way all the time.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.200]   So back to the issue that you raised before we talked about correlation, about which funds
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   do we choose.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   And by the way, throughout this interview, please correct me if I get anything wrong.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.440]   And feel any need to allow me to go on.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.620]   But this is where I'm at currently with my own perspective on the question of active
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.880]   versus passive.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.020]   You have to look at the actual market.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.600]   So I could believe that for the most part, something like the stocks that are listed
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.360]   on the New York Stock Exchange, that's a highly efficient market.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.440]   There are a limited number of issues.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.840]   There are a massive number of analysts looking at things.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.880]   The companies that are involved are the most public companies in the world.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.000]   They're the most highly regulated.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.040]   Everything is conveyed in advance.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.680]   All of the information is there.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.920]   So I could believe that that market is very efficient and that it's very difficult for
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.000]   a manager to bring a lot of value in that marketplace.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   However, when I look at something like the bond market, and we go from, if you know the
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.960]   numbers, a few thousand issues to many tens and tens of thousands of individual bond issues.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.160]   Well, in this situation now, it's very hard for me to believe, well, I believe at the
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.480]   moment that underwriting is going to make a big difference.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.600]   Individually underwriting various bond issues.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.560]   There are so many thousands of issues that are out in the marketplace that an analyst
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.080]   can bring some value, if for nothing else, then to provide some basic screens against
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.680]   municipalities that are bankrupt and getting ready to launch a multi-billion dollar stadium
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.360]   for a team that's defunct and has no fan base.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.480]   So something as simple as that, or moving from, say, large cap US stocks to a micro-cap
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.160]   area where underwriting now is going to make a much bigger difference.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   So I get annoyed when people paint with broad brush strokes and say, well, index investing
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.220]   and passive investing is always better than active investing.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.320]   And I say, well, wait a second, let's look and see, is it feasible that a manager can
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   add some value?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.920]   Real estate would be another example.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.960]   A real estate index fund might have some place if you're just simply saying, I want to figure
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.680]   out how to factor the variability of interest rates and the market in general as it reacts
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.800]   to the economy in.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.160]   But any real estate investor knows that the actual underwriting of each rental property
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:43.440]   is of key importance because the property in your town that's in the ideal up and coming
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.160]   neighborhood versus the property on the outskirts of town that's in the neighborhood that's
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.840]   going to pot will make a massive difference in your returns.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.320]   So let me annoy you.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   Please, this is good.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:04.240]   You are correct in some parts of what you say, but you're incorrect in most of what you
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   just said.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   The data doesn't show that even in the bond market, the active managers are able to outperform
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.200]   the benchmarks, even though the benchmarks are cap weighted, which you think about it,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.320]   companies that are in trouble and need to issue a lot of debt end up with a bigger part
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   of the bond market.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.640]   So why would you want to buy more of them?
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.360]   But the fact is, the indexes actually outperform most of the active managers who are doing
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:43.040]   what you suggested, trying to find the inefficiencies and outperform.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.840]   The same thing with emerging markets, the same thing with micro cap, the same thing
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.720]   with whatever market.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.920]   In the long run, when you look at the data of the active managers who are paid, the professionals
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:02.840]   who are paid to try to outperform those benchmarks, the data shows in every asset class, in every
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:09.100]   category that the benchmark outperforms most managers.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.280]   Not all, but here's the problem.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:23.960]   I can't figure out, and neither can most people, which managers I'm going to use and pay who
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.920]   will be the minority who will outperform.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.640]   You just can't tell in advance.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.080]   So that's difficult.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.800]   Most of the time, you're going to pick one who's going to underperform.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.340]   But that's just one side of the coin.
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:48.040]   The other side of the coin is, and what's always kind of lost in the discussion, is
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.200]   the next derivative of this is, well, let's look at the managers who outperformed and
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:00.560]   let's see on average how much they outperformed by on an annualized basis.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.600]   And let's look at the managers who underperformed and let's see how much they underperformed
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.420]   by on an annualized basis.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.640]   And here's the problem.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.280]   A minority of managers outperform.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:21.860]   So therefore, the probability of you finding one is low, and therefore, you would expect
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:29.020]   a huge risk premium for finding one, a very high excess return if you actually found a
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.720]   manager that outperformed.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:39.460]   But in fact, the alpha that they deliver is exceedingly low relative to the huge risks
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.960]   that you took going out trying to find that manager and by not using indexing.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:54.260]   The average underperformance of active managers is two to three times the average alpha that
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.140]   the outperforming managers deliver.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.660]   So even when you win, you lose, it's not a fair game.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.100]   You're not getting paid enough for the risks that you took.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.060]   So it's a probability, there's a low probability you're going to find an active manager that
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:16.680]   outperforms ex ante, which means before they outperform.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.180]   And then the payout that they're delivering on average isn't nearly enough to compensate
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.980]   you for what the average underperformance is of all the other managers.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.460]   And by the way, there's a lot of managers who don't even make it that far.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.280]   They go out of business or they end up merging with another company.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.960]   So this is all about probability and payout.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.940]   For a portfolio that a person is going to put together for themselves or for their clients,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:50.260]   if you put a portfolio together of only index funds and every single asset class, and let's
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.900]   say you're going to use 10 different asset classes and 10 different styles and you only
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:02.540]   use index funds, the probability that that portfolio of index funds will outperform any
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   randomly selected portfolio of actively managed funds in the same asset classes is over 90%.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.900]   But there's no reason to select a randomly selected portfolio.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.900]   So we can go into that.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.900]   Exactly.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.900]   I understand you.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.420]   We can go into, well, we can just pick the ones that have low fees.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.020]   So we look at the funds that have low fees that are actively managed, for example, because
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.580]   we know that fees matter.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:28.300]   And we find that a high percentage of the low fee actively managed funds track the indexes
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   very closely.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.480]   In other words, they're closet index funds.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.860]   So you're paying more money for basically an index fund.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.260]   It doesn't increase the probability by very much that those funds are going to outperform.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.940]   So you say, okay, what else can we do?
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.940]   Well, let's look at past performance.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.820]   Well, we study after study after study shows that if you pick managers based on their past
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.140]   performance, there's a high probability you're going to underperform in the future.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.960]   There's what's called persistent studies by S&P that are put out every six months.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.700]   And if you just say, we take a hundred funds and we say, okay, here are a hundred funds
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:08.620]   that outperformed or in the top quartile in the last three or five years.
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.240]   How did those hundred funds perform over the next three to five years?
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.200]   We find out that it doesn't even come up to a random number.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.740]   You would figure over 25% would stay in the top 25% over the next three or five years.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.740]   And it's less than 25%.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.660]   I mean, it's not even random.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.900]   So it's extremely difficult to say that past performance gives you good future performance.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.080]   You can't say that low fees give you good future performance.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.700]   So what is it that you're going to use that's going to determine what the performance of
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.200]   a fund is going to be going forward?
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.940]   And do you really even need to take that risk as an investor?
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:56.100]   So then why are you utilizing a managed bond fund of an unnamed origin in some of your
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.100]   investments?
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.640]   Because again, looking at, I want to capture the risk and the return of the asset class
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.580]   in the most diversified, lowest cost way.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.680]   Now indexing and index funds and ETFs are not to the point yet in every single asset
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:17.340]   class where they are the best representation of an asset class.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:24.700]   So this particular unnamed fund that I can't name for compliance reasons has 6,000 municipal
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:32.660]   bonds in it and the fee is, I think, 10 basis points and it's an actively managed fund.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:41.380]   The best closest index fund has maybe 2,000 municipal bonds and the fee is 25 basis points.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:48.260]   So my point is, well, the index fund is higher cost, has less diversification than the active
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.260]   fund.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.660]   And so if I want to get the best representation of an asset class, I'm going to use this fund
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:59.580]   even though technically the active fund, technically it's active, but it's a better index fund
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.620]   of municipal bonds than the actual municipal bond index funds out there.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.780]   And that's what I mean by, you've got to look at what's in the fund.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.780]   What are you trying to capture?
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.220]   And most of the time, or a lot of times it's index funds, but other times it's not going
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.460]   to be.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.220]   So do you think the management of that fund then is...
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.780]   No, they're not adding any value.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   I'm not buying them because they're adding value.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.220]   You're just buying them because they're a massive fund and they're cheap and they represent
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.140]   the broadest access to the market in a single security.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.140]   Okay.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.140]   Now, I don't generally...
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.140]   Yes, correct.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.940]   But that was true about municipal bonds.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.940]   But let's talk about, instead of representing a market, let's talk about representing a
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.940]   risk.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.940]   Okay.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.940]   Okay.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.940]   So if I do a portfolio asset allocation, it's really risk diversification.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.780]   So you isolate out all the different risks in the marketplace and then you make a determination
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.180]   as to whether or not you're going to take a position in that risk.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.700]   For example, in the bond market, there's two general risks.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:06.420]   There's term risk, which is longevity or maturity type risk, where you invest in long-term bonds,
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.960]   you get a higher return than investing in short-term bonds.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.260]   Then there's credit risk, where if you get less quality bonds, you get a higher return
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.520]   than high quality bonds.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.580]   So you have to determine where you want to fit those two risks, how much of those risks
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.660]   you want to have in your portfolio.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.620]   And then you go from there to seek out the best representation of those risks.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.580]   And those are the funds that you buy to put in the portfolio, as long as they're well
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.620]   diversified and low cost.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.380]   And same thing goes with factor investing.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.940]   For example, if you believe in taking a bigger position to value stocks, and we can have
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.740]   a whole discussion about this, I mean, an hour long.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.620]   But if you decide that you want to take a position in value stocks, the question is,
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.640]   how do you determine value?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.800]   Which factors do you use to determine value?
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:59.820]   How do you measure the cost per unit of risk in each of the funds that you're looking at?
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.620]   So if I want to get more value exposure in my portfolio, I just use a value index fund?
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.840]   Well, it turns out, no, because they don't actually give you the best value exposure.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.560]   You would use some other company that I can't name to get the best value exposure in your
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   portfolio, even though it's a little more expensive.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.600]   And even though it's quantitative or actively managed, it's the best way to get that value
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.040]   risk in your portfolio.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.920]   And it's not an index.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.480]   So what's the proof that you have if you're constructing a portfolio?
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.760]   Let's walk through the process of constructing a portfolio.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.400]   And I come in and I say, Rick, here's my retirement portfolio.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.360]   It's got a million dollars in it.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.760]   I need to invest it in such a way that it's going to provide for my family's financial
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.680]   security and retirement.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.360]   What's the first stage in that process?
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.100]   Okay, so you're talking now, what I've been talking so far, and all we've talked about
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.320]   now is my side, which is the academic side.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   Right, right.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.640]   But where I want to go is I want to talk through the client side.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.520]   But then I want to go back to the academic side and say, how do you construct the portfolio
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.080]   figuring out which proportion for value to measure the risk and goals of my portfolio?
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.320]   This is a great question.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.440]   So now I have to flip around and put my financial advisor hat on because I'm sitting in front
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.480]   of a client and I'm talking with the client.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   So we do the basic, who are you?
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.840]   What risks do you have in your life?
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.880]   Do you have job security?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.200]   What kind of income do you have?
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:41.440]   All the kind of basic financial planning issues to determine how much you're going to need
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.300]   at some retirement date, how much you're going to need to draw off that portfolio at a retirement
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.640]   date in order for you to achieve your life goals.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   So we have that conversation.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   Build the financial plan.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   Exactly.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   That's all it is.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:01.000]   And then from there, it'll come up with a stock and bond mix and maybe a portion carved
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.480]   out for emergency funds.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   But just leave that out for a while and just talk about how much of the portfolio should
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.000]   be in lower risk assets and how much can we put away for higher risk assets to have a
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.600]   greater return later on down the road.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.600]   Very basic stuff.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.560]   Now again, I'm talking with a individual investor here.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.000]   And we come up with not so much, well, first we come up with the number of the asset allocation.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.240]   In my mind, I generate what kind of rate of return they're going to need and that in my
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.520]   mind generates what kind of a stock and bond mix they should have.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.080]   But that's not the end of it.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.200]   I have to make sure that whatever that asset allocation is fits the client's emotional
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:46.460]   makeup so that they're not going to capitulate with that asset allocation in a bad market.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.520]   So we don't do clients any good.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.720]   Not so ever if we recommend asset allocations that they can't handle in a bad market.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.560]   And then a lot of times the clients have, they may have a high tolerance for risk, but
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.640]   they shouldn't be taking much risk based on where they are and what's going on.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.600]   So we go through this whole process with them.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.240]   So let's say we come up with a portfolio that's 50/50.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.280]   50 stocks, 50 bonds.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   Great.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.000]   At that point, I say to them, oh by the way, also look at the tax side of it too.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.040]   Is this taxable money, non-taxable money?
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.460]   So IRA, non-taxable.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:23.840]   So the next thing is at that point, we basically stop with the client.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.160]   Then we create the portfolio.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.720]   So the client's not involved in that side of it, but I'm putting together based on my
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:40.520]   academic work what has the highest probability of maximizing the risk and return within each
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.280]   asset class, stocks and bonds.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:48.080]   And then I put together the 50/50 portfolio based on that.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.520]   So you're looking at that and you come up with the idea, okay, of these stocks we want
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.220]   35% weighted to large cap stocks.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:04.760]   Now within the 35%, what's your proof of what proportion should be designated into value
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.000]   versus other aspects of large cap stocks?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Well let me make another plug for my book all about asset allocation because it's all
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   in there.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Nice.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.260]   Of basically the efficient frontier of total market to value type investing.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:26.240]   And it shows you that somewhere around 30% seems to be a middle of the road number.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.640]   And everything, by the way, with asset allocation when you're talking about these things is
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.520]   a sort of a middle of the road number.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.640]   And I can give you a rule of thumb.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:40.280]   If you take the risky equity asset class and the non-riskier large cap stocks versus small
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.160]   cap value, small cap value has higher risk and higher return expectation and large cap
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.240]   has lower risk and lower return.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.920]   So if you do an efficient frontier between those two, you come up with about 30% every
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.920]   time.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.560]   Doesn't matter what the asset classes are.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.160]   The efficient frontier ends up putting you somewhere around 30% roughly.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   Do you follow that, what I just said?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.720]   That's how I build it.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:12.040]   I actually only use 25% go into these factor type funds.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.160]   I don't even go to 30 and that's because of psychological.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:22.120]   There's too much tracking error in the portfolio if you get much above 25% in these factor
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   type strategies.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.880]   Where the client may capitulate because the equity portfolio is underperforming the stock
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.760]   market by too much when those factors don't deliver.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.160]   I just threw a whole bunch of stuff in there by the way.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.920]   A whole book can be written on that.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   Indeed.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.280]   It gets pretty meaty.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.360]   Instead of going deeper into that, I want to ask about the concept of risk, specifically
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.460]   with stocks versus bonds.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.760]   When I was a practicing financial advisor speaking with clients with a responsibility
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.320]   on paper managing portfolios, I never could have made this statement nor could I have
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:09.200]   put it into practice because the firm has to protect itself based upon the need for
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.600]   the client's portfolio to match their stated risk tolerance on paper based upon standard
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.040]   investment industry norms.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.320]   If the client says, "I'm a balanced investor," or "I'm a moderately conservative investor,"
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.440]   their portfolio needs to reflect that with an aspect of stocks versus bonds.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:31.480]   However, since I no longer have that responsibility, I can make a statement like this.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:40.880]   For me, I am persuaded that it is easier for me to modify my emotional makeup with regard
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:48.520]   to stocks and the variability of the market and also to plan appropriately in my personal
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:54.720]   finances to counter for the massive swings of up and down market risk.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:01.960]   Such that in my own personal portfolios, I would rather be in a 100% stock allocation
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.880]   in order to generate the highest long-term return.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:12.060]   I get very concerned in working with clients and looking at client portfolios with the
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:18.520]   amount of assets that people have dedicated towards bonds based upon this concept of,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.640]   "I'm a conservative investor."
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.560]   I get concerned because I look at the long-term return versus the risk that they face of the
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.880]   decrease in value of their money, the inflation risk.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:36.160]   I say, "It's easier for me," and if I had an iron fist over, say, my dad and mom's accounts,
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.240]   "It's easier for me to make a financial plan with enough cash on hand that I don't have
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.000]   to pull from the market if we get a down year.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.520]   I want the 100% stock portfolio because I want the highest total maximum return."
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.080]   I don't personally buy for me or for my mom and dad, I don't buy the concept of, "Oh, we
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.160]   got to do a 60/40 split."
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   Am I wrong?
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.560]   No, not for you.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:04.040]   You're not wrong because you understand it and because you're at the level of your knowledge
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:09.160]   where you understand that you can put money aside, which by the way is like a bond.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   So therefore, you actually do have a bond portfolio.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.520]   So you are not 100% equity.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.160]   But the bottom line on that is that that's for you, absolutely.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.200]   I am 58 years old and I have 100% equity.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   Wow, crazy.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.800]   Why would a 58-year-old have 100% equity?
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.200]   Only because, well, I'm going to get a military pension.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   I've got a small pension coming in from Smith Barney.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.160]   I've got a small pension that's going to be coming in from Peter Peabody.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   I've got a small pension.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.280]   I'll be getting Social Security.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.600]   My wife's going to be getting Social Security.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.720]   I have that.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.000]   So I don't need bonds per se in my portfolio with the exception of the emergency fund that
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.320]   I have.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.400]   But everybody's different.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.640]   You are at a much higher knowledge level than most of the people that you would be working
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:05.340]   with if you were an investment advisor or a financial planner.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.240]   Everybody is brave in a bull market.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:15.880]   The problem is if you take their bravery and you turn it into an asset allocation based
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:22.240]   on what they think their risk tolerance is after the market goes up 250%, you would be
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.620]   doing them a disservice because they would capitulate in the next bear market and there's
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.000]   no way they're going to get that back.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.280]   You would have really done a disservice to the client.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   Even though it's technically correct what you said, we want to get the best return for
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   the clients.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.160]   We would like them to know as much as we do, but I can't take my brain and put it in their
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.240]   head.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   So I have to pull back and work on what is in their best interest.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.820]   And sometimes even though having 100% equity is certainly in somebody's best interest,
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.620]   it isn't in their best interest because they're going to capitulate as soon as the market
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.620]   goes down.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.620]   So it's not in their best interest.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.640]   And so the other side of the coin is the emotional reaction.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:16.720]   And the hardest part about what we do as financial advisors isn't the asset allocation, technical,
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   efficient frontier, whatever.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   It's all the same for every company.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.920]   Yeah, 25% small value, some reach, so whatever it is.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.240]   That's the easy part.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.880]   I can teach a 10-year-old how to do that.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:33.200]   The hard part is reading the client and trying to figure out what is the best strategy for
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.340]   them, knowing the technical side, knowing what they need, but also knowing how people
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.340]   act.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.960]   And that's the hard part.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.740]   And I'm even personally, I'm a little unsure of my opinions in this area because I spent
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.380]   six years working with clients, the first three of which were focused on insurance,
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.280]   the last three of which I started to build my wealth management practice.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.340]   And during that time, I never walked with clients through a major downturn.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:07.380]   And by the time even this, all the tiniest downturns a few months or so ago, I wasn't
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.380]   working with clients.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.820]   I'm working with client portfolios.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.000]   So I've not walked through a difficult time period.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.060]   It's an intellectual exercise for me.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.460]   But looking at it intellectually, the concern that I have, and what I always felt when I
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.380]   was doing planning, is that as a financial planner, our major tool that we should be
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:30.900]   utilizing is not necessarily the asset classes within the IRA portfolio, but the asset classes
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.300]   that the client is more used to controlling.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:40.340]   So thinking, yes, could you keep $100,000 of cash in the checking account, and/or you
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:45.300]   could keep the $100,000 in cash or a short-term bond in the portfolio.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.980]   And yes, it has the same effect, but the reality is that the cash in the checking account is
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.340]   accessible for the client, so I can point and say, "Look, ignore the portfolio over
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.580]   here and look at the $100,000 in the checking account during times when the market is down."
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:11.400]   And I look and I say, "Okay, a 60/40 portfolio versus 100/0, is the emotional mania driven
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:17.620]   by the actual numbers on the statement, or is the emotional mania driven by the newscaster
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:22.280]   on 5 o'clock saying, "Well, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped today by 487 points?"
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:28.700]   So it's both, because you can imagine when you see that the market's down 2% in one
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:35.240]   day, you don't need to look at your statements or get online to know that you're down.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.320]   You know that.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.660]   So you're going to have that reaction anyway.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:50.620]   But to your point about putting stocks in one fund, let's say your IRA or your personal
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:56.020]   fund, and just have all stocks there, and then your emergency money maybe being in a
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.940]   short-term bond fund or CDs.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:05.180]   And so together you might have 70% stocks and 30% bonds when you put those two together.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:12.180]   In somebody's head, when the market is going down, they're only looking at the stock portfolio.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.420]   And I'll give you a story.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:23.100]   So I used to fly fighter aircraft in the military, and we have had situations where pilots are
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:29.980]   rolling in on targets, and they roll out, and they want to hit that target so bad, they
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:35.540]   get fixated on that target, and they drive the plane right into the ground.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.580]   They kill themselves.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.060]   So what happens is the same thing here.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:45.260]   The clients will fixate on just that equity portfolio, and they'll drive themselves into
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.420]   the ground and blow it up.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:56.220]   So that's why I say, should you have a portfolio of just stocks over here, and maybe a portfolio
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:02.740]   of just bonds over there, or should you have a balanced portfolio on both sides?
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:09.500]   And what I find is that psychologically, it's easier for people to, even though the same
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:15.860]   asset allocation is 70/30, to have a 70/30 over here in your personal savings account,
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:25.020]   and 70/30 over here in your IRA account, because you don't get so fixated on the dive, if you
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.140]   will, that's going on.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.340]   So what about this?
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.080]   What about the fact that clients are looking at a bond portfolio, and no matter what the
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:39.220]   numbers say, then it's very easy for the news mania to creep in and say, well, interest
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.980]   rates are going to rise, and your bond portfolio is going to plummet in value because interest
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   rates are going to rise.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.540]   And yeah, the Federal Reserve, if they make this tiny rate hike, then all of a sudden,
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.180]   you're going to be down 40% of your value, and your bond mutual fund has an unlimited
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.540]   duration over time, because it's always got to be-- it doesn't.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.340]   What I mean is that instead of looking at it and saying, OK, this individual bond issue
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:03.660]   that I have is going to mature, they can say, well, this mutual fund, yeah, it has a duration,
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.420]   but because they're always cycling new bonds in, maybe this bond portfolio can evaporate.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.260]   I've seen that mania, too.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:14.700]   And so without data to come against that, it's so easy for us to be susceptible to even
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.820]   that, this fear of bonds.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.180]   I agree.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:24.140]   And we've probably had more bond fear than we've had stock fear in the last six years.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:33.220]   But-- and we have had-- I was talking to-- I won't name them, but it's a-- I happen to
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.700]   be in the offices of one of the very large robo-advisor firms, because I know them all
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.340]   really well, so I go visit them.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.980]   This one happens to be in New York, but I won't mention their name for compliance reasons.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:48.480]   Anyway, I'm there and talking with them, and they were trying to figure out how to answer
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.860]   questions from clients who call in and have fears.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.580]   And the fellow who I won't mention his name said, we were thinking about having a dial-in
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.220]   number where it says, if you think interest rates are going to go up and the value of
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.500]   your bonds are going to go down, press one.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.780]   If you think the stock market is going to continue to fall, press two.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:11.140]   And then get a recording, because it's the same answer.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:19.740]   But yeah, these fears are difficult for people who don't have a lot of experience.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.380]   And this is where the advisor comes in.
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.980]   This is where we make our money.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.740]   We make our money figuring these things out.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.260]   Like I said, the technical side of this is easy.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.660]   It's the emotional and the coaching side for the client that's hard.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.220]   The therapy side that's hard for the client.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   But if we can do it, if we can keep them invested and keep them on track, stay the course, like
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:53.260]   John Bogle says, that's really a value added to the client.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.980]   Last question.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.780]   So let's talk from your academic background and perspective.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:04.540]   I've had a few portfolio managers or people who are on the show who talk about this.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:11.140]   One of the most popular portfolios, and I've talked about it on the show, would be the
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.220]   permanent portfolio.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:19.540]   The idea of 25% in each of four asset classes, including gold, including cash, and cash
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.740]   equivalents.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:28.160]   Academically that portfolio, depending on what you look at, often doesn't seem to perform
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.420]   when compared against other portfolios because of the underexposure to stocks.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.180]   However, emotionally and psychologically, I believe it's powerful.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:43.860]   Even for me, I still at times consider, I wonder if I should just be running the permanent
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.020]   portfolio.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:52.360]   It's so emotionally powerful that I wonder if it's not a better solution than we often
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.380]   give it credit because it fits that narrative and it allows you to look at the movements
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.460]   of the monetary system.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.660]   It allows you to look at the government system and say, "Well, okay, I've got these protections
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.660]   in place."
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.660]   What's your perspective on that?
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.660]   All right, I'm going to back up to a 10,000 foot level.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.020]   There's a difference between investment philosophy and investment strategy.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.780]   What you just talked about was a strategy.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:21.260]   Philosophy is, I'm going to buy these four different asset classes.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.500]   I'm going to do it in a low cost way.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:30.580]   I'm going to buy a global stock index fund, a total bond market bond fund.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.940]   I'm going to put my money over here in, I don't know, one year of CDs and I'm going
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.340]   to buy a gold ETF.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.660]   It's going to be passive.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.500]   It's going to be low cost.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:49.900]   It's going to be 25% in each and this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:57.060]   The idea of doing passive low cost is a philosophy.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:03.960]   You and I, I believe, or I don't know, but maybe you and I have the same philosophy about
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.460]   low cost passive is the way to go.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.220]   I don't know if you believe that or not, but I do.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.420]   When I, all my clients do because that's the way they're investing.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.020]   That's philosophy.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.940]   The other side of the philosophy is active management, try to pick managers who are going
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.660]   to outperform, try to time the market and all that.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.140]   That's the other philosophy.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.660]   I gave up on that years ago.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.340]   I'm in this church here and I'm pretty far up the number of pews.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.180]   In fact, I'm probably at the altar.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.180]   That's the philosophy.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.180]   You're preaching from the pulpit.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.020]   I'm in the choir anyway.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.020]   John Bogle is the high priest.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:43.460]   I'm in the choir.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.580]   Everybody in the church has the same philosophy.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:53.300]   No one in that church has the same strategy, which is what you were talking about.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:59.380]   How for me should I take this philosophy, divide it up into an asset allocation and
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:04.100]   different asset classes, implement it and maintain it?
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.380]   Everyone in that church is going to have a different strategy for how they do that and
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.720]   how they apply it to their life.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.260]   Same philosophy, different strategy.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.660]   To get to your question is, if it works for you, great.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:21.940]   That was a really fast answer after a really great intro.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.180]   I like it.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:28.820]   Rick, tell us about your service offerings for advisors and for individuals if anybody
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.180]   wants to work with you directly.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.180]   Books, websites, materials.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.820]   Let's have your commercial here for the ways that you can help the listeners of this show.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.300]   I appreciate that.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.140]   You go to rickferry.com.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.180]   I tried to make it simple even for myself.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.100]   If I have my name on my website, I won't forget what it is.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.100]   R-I-C-K-F-E-R-R-I.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.100]   R-I.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.100]   That's correct.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.100]   F-E-R-R-I.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.380]   There, I have my blog.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.380]   I have my books.
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.780]   I have a link to our company website which is Portfolio Solutions.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:03.660]   There, we actually implement this philosophy for clients using various strategies based
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.100]   on their particular needs.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   We implement it through custodians such as Schwab and TD Ameritrade.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:16.500]   We charge a low fee to help them determine what portfolios they should have.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:22.860]   Then we do all of the back office administration and rebalancing, purchase everything, rebalance,
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.380]   report, and all this standard portfolio management stuff that we do.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.380]   We do it at a low fee.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.940]   We've been doing it for 16 years.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:34.420]   Recently, we've reached out to advisors and we said, "We will now do this for your clients
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.140]   directly where you have a portal and you're going to run that relationship with the client,
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.420]   but we're going to manage the portfolio using the same strategies."
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:46.460]   The fees for this are, for clients who come to us directly, it's 37 basis points.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:51.300]   That includes access to our CFPs to figure out what their investment needs are and so
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.300]   forth.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:58.180]   If an advisor is in the picture and the advisor sends us a client, it's 25 basis points management
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.180]   fee.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.980]   That's what Portfolio Solutions does.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.660]   We have 1.4 billion under management.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.020]   We've got a staff of 16.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.180]   We've been doing this a long time.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:13.100]   We were the original low cost RIA out there.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.020]   There's a lot of competition out there now that wasn't out there before.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:20.100]   I'd like to believe that because we've been so successful, people have seen us and said,
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.100]   "Let's copy it."
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:26.540]   That would include that great big company out on the East Coast that we can't talk about,
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   of course.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:32.660]   >> I just love, it's never been a better time to be an equity investor.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.460]   As far as cost, lower than ever.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.340]   Information access to information, lower than ever.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.540]   It's better than a worst time probably to be an uneducated investor because the manias
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.900]   seem to get worse.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.900]   It just seems to get tougher and tougher.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.340]   Rick Ferri, F-E-R-R-I.com.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.340]   Thanks so much for coming on.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.340]   You're welcome back anytime.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.340]   >> Thank you.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.340]   I appreciate it.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.340]   Thank you very much.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.380]   >> Those of you who are long time listeners to the show will have heard loud and clear
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.500]   my tongue in cheek at the beginning of the show when talking about that this is the only
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.460]   right way to invest.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.500]   Hopefully you've gained and learned a lot from Rick.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.020]   He's a really great guy and extremely knowledgeable.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.740]   He presents a strong case and I would encourage you to become knowledgeable about those options
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:20.660]   and make sure that you're using the information that he shared with you and also other information
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.340]   that you can find as well to figure out what is best and right for you.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.340]   So I hope that you learned a lot and I hope you really enjoyed that.
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.540]   Thank you so much for listening to Radical Personal Finance today.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.000]   I really appreciate each and every one of you who listens.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.380]   Thank you especially to those of you who share the show with others.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.940]   I've done very little marketing for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:42.460]   I decided that I could either spend time creating great content or I could spend time marketing.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.940]   In the beginning I didn't have the capacity for both and still I don't have the capacity
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.720]   to do both really, really well.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.140]   So anytime I have a decision of Joshua, do you want to sit down and create another show
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.980]   or should you work a little bit longer to try to create a better show or should you
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.360]   go ahead and try to figure out how to do some new marketing thing, I always choose create
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   a better show.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.060]   But what that means is I need your help to market the show.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.400]   I need your help to share the show with others.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.820]   The best way to do it is just simply to tell somebody else about the show.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.020]   If you would like them to listen, just tell them all they need to do is search the App
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.220]   Store on their phone and they can download our free app and we're in every single App
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.220]   Store.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:23.500]   So we're in iOS App Store, Apple App Store, Google Play, for any Android device.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.980]   If you have a Blackberry, you'll find it.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.780]   My dad has a Blackberry and he finds it when he has my show.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.500]   I downloaded them Blackberry.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.220]   Windows phones, we have an app for Windows phones and we have an app for what's the last
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.220]   one?
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.220]   Amazon Fire Phone.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.620]   And she's got my app.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:42.520]   So all of those options will work and you can find the app.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.360]   So please tell somebody else about the show.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.620]   Just tell them search the App Store for Radical Personal Finance and they can listen.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.000]   I know the content is voluminous.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.180]   At this point in time, I'd like to create some better, more synthesized, carefully built
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.420]   courses and I'm working on that.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.200]   As soon as I can get that done, I will do that.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.660]   Which leads me to the Patreon campaign.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:02.540]   Thank you to those of you who support the show on Patreon.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:07.060]   At the moment, I would ask, let's pull it up here before I run out of music.
