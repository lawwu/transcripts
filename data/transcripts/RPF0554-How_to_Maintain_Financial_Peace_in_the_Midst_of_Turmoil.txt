[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.740]   usually happens to me is I have very
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.840]   usually happens to me is I have very
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.740]   usually happens to me is I have very aggressive schedules. I have all
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.740]   aggressive schedules. I have all
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.840]   aggressive schedules. I have all kinds of things that I think I can
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.900]   kinds of things that I think I can get
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.940]   kinds of things that I think I can get done.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.740]   kinds of things that I think I can get done. I've had to learn to moderate
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:58.720]   all kinds of things that I think I can get done. I've had to learn to moderate
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   all kinds of things that I think I can get done. I've had to learn to moderate my commitments. I can't actually follow
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.020]   all kinds of things that I think I can get done. I've had to learn to moderate my commitments. I can't actually follow
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.100]   all kinds of things that I think I can get done. I've had to learn to moderate my commitments. I can't actually follow through. That causes me emotional
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.160]   my commitments. I can't actually follow through. That causes me emotional
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.200]   my commitments. I can't actually follow through. That causes me emotional turmoil to feel like I'm letting down
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.260]   through. That causes me emotional turmoil to feel like I'm letting down
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.860]   through. That causes me emotional turmoil to feel like I'm letting down on my commitments. I find that very
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.960]   turmoil to feel like I'm letting down on my commitments. I find that very
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:30.060]  , and I'm not saying that I'm
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.100]   on my commitments. I find that very
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.120]   on my commitments. I find that very important. I think that's
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.200]   important. I think that's
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   important. I think that's what I'm trying to do. I think that's
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.240]   I doubt it'll be totaled, but pretty
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.300]   I doubt it'll be totaled, but pretty
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.080]   I doubt it'll be totaled, but pretty beat up. So, for example, the topper
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.140]   beat up. So, for example, the topper
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.080]   beat up. So, for example, the topper was completely gone. What it looks
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.120]   was completely gone. What it looks
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.580]   was completely gone. What it looks like the thieves did is first they
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.620]   like the thieves did is first they
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.080]   like the thieves did is first they stole my pickup truck and then
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.140]   stole my pickup truck and then
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.080]   stole my pickup truck and then they used it to commit other crimes.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.120]   they used it to commit other crimes.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.580]   they used it to commit other crimes. The police had other crimes,
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.580]   The police had other crimes,
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.920]   The police had other crimes, other attempted theft of vehicles
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   other attempted theft of vehicles and some other things where my
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:23.720]  , and some other things where my
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.080]  , and some other things where my vehicle was visible at the scene,
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.120]   vehicle was visible at the scene,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   vehicle was visible at the scene, which that's of course not a great
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.120]   which that's of course not a great
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.960]   which that's of course not a great feeling. And in addition to that,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   feeling. And in addition to that,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   feeling. And in addition to that, they somehow somewhere, our bet, they
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   they somehow somewhere, our bet, they try to use the truck to ram into an ATM. Basically, they took my pickup truck and they drove it into something crazy hard in the back end. So hard that the trailer hitch, which of course I need, was completely destroyed, completely bent down about a foot and a half.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.800]   completely bent down about a foot and a half. The tailgate of the truck is missing, and the whole big giant commercial truck cap that I had on the back of it is entirely gone.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.000]   The tailgate of the truck is missing, and the whole big giant commercial truck cap that I had on the back of it is entirely gone.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.320]   The tailgate of the truck is missing, and the whole big giant commercial truck cap that I had on the back of it is entirely gone. Still haven't found it. I looked around to try to see if I could salvage it, but still haven't been able to find it.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.380]   Still haven't found it. I looked around to try to see if I could salvage it, but still haven't been able to find it.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.980]   Still haven't found it. I looked around to try to see if I could salvage it, but still haven't been able to find it. And then of course, the truck is totally scraped up and just a bunch of cosmetic damage.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:13.080]   Still haven't found it. I looked around to try to see if I could salvage it, but still haven't been able to find it.

When your stuff gets stolen and you have to then figure out, well now what do I do when your stuff is stolen and destroyed by other people, then your life gets disrupted and it can be a big financial impact.

So by developing discipline and living within means and below them or even far below, the impact of harm and problems like your truck getting messed up or your house burning down, those things can be of much less impact.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.000]   So live within and preferably below them.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.540]   Bowl, your means. Who is ironic because on Saturday evening, which was the time at which my truck was being stolen, my wife and I were talking about some other RVers that we knew and we were admiring their very beautiful RVs that they had bought for their family.

Now I don't know anything about their financial situation.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:48.080]  , I know nothing. So I'm merely speculating. But I'm aware of enough clues due to experience as a financial planner to think that they probably are not multimillionaires at this point in time.

[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.580]   And they were looking in, bought a beautiful RV and I just thought to myself, they were going full time on the road. And I thought that would be so stressful.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.620]   So stressful to make big decisions, to buy big fancy things when you haven't tested it.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.620]   So stressful to make big decisions, to buy big fancy things when you haven't tested it.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.620]   Maybe a year from now, two years from now, I doubt I'll still be RVing, but if I am, maybe I'll buy a big fancy beautiful rig.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.620]   Maybe a year from now, two years from now, I doubt I'll still be RVing, but if I am, maybe I'll buy a big fancy beautiful rig.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.620]   But I'm not going to make big financial commitments when I have little actual knowledge.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:11.620]   But I'm not going to make big financial commitments when I have little actual knowledge.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.620]   And I'm not going to make big financial commitments that would impact other aspects of my money, of my wealth.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.620]   And I'm not going to make big financial commitments that would impact other aspects of my money, of my wealth.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:41.660]   So by restricting yourself to lower cost, more frugal options, you buy freedom.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.660]   Remember, if you look at people and you study the psychology and the behavior of why certain people behave as they do,
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.660]   The people who drive a cheaper car, the people who drive a cheaper car,

[00:21:44.700 --> 00:22:06.700]   and also have money, because many people drive cheap cars because that's all they have, but somebody who drives a cheaper car and has money, they don't do it because they don't like the fancier car.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.700]   They do it because they like something else more than they like the fancier car.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.700]   They do it because they like something else more than they like the fancier car.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.700]   In my case, that's freedom and independence.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.700]   In my case, that's freedom and independence.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.700]   So I'd rather have a not very fancy truck.

So keep the stuff. Don't diversify your money. Don't let all your money be tied up in a single thing. That way if your truck is stolen or your house burns down or your vacation cottage is ransacked or whatever,
