[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.840]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.760]   My name is Josh when today I'm going to share with you on a topic that's near and
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.080]   dear to my heart, but I'm doing so not as a expert, but as an as a fellow traveler,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.440]   as a fellow journeyer down this path, enjoying living my rich life now while working towards
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.600]   financial freedom and financial independence.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.080]   And part of that comes with weathering life's storms.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.040]   The latest storm is that this was the week that my family and I were going to be packing
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040]   up and hitting the road in our RV.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.320]   And that's been quite the challenge.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.840]   We're already about three months behind our anticipated schedule.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.560]   And then of course, it's challenging to move.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.000]   Anytime you move, that's disruptive to your life.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.520]   Just to pack things up and move from one house to another, that's challenging.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.240]   Moving with little children is challenging.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.120]   Moving from a house into an RV is challenging.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.360]   And then moving while working to maintain a business and all of that is extra challenging.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.600]   Well, that was compounded this weekend when my tow vehicle, my big diesel pickup truck
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.840]   that I bought to pull our travel trailer with was stolen and pretty beat up, pretty messed
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.680]   up by the thieves this weekend.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.920]   The backstory is I had the truck in the shop for a few last minute fixes before heading
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.060]   out on the trip.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.560]   One of which was to have the tinting repaired on the front two windows.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.000]   Usually when you buy an older vehicle, yes, you can save a lot of money in depreciation,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   but you got a budget for fixing all the stuff that really should have been fixed previously.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.760]   And one of those things was the tinting.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.800]   Old, it was bubbled.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.480]   And so of course, who wants to set out across the country when you can hardly see out your
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   windows?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   It does you no good to be somewhere beautiful if you can't see it.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.840]   So it was having the tinting replaced.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.920]   Well, Monday morning came in and went to pick up the vehicle only to find out that it was
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.960]   gone.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.400]   And it was stolen over the weekend from right out in front of the tint repair shop.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.360]   On the truck, I have a big old or had, we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.340]   I had a big old commercial truck topper, which gives me a lot of storage space in the actual
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.820]   bed of the pickup truck.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.260]   And so because of that, they couldn't quite fit it in their shop.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560]   And so they left it out front and it was stolen over the weekend.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   So that started off Monday.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.720]   And of course, what usually happens to me is I have very aggressive schedules.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.920]   I have all kinds of things that I think I can get done.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.720]   I've had to learn to moderate my mouth because usually I think I can do about five times
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.740]   more than I can do actually.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.520]   And that's frustrating to me because doing what I say I'm going to do is important to
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   me.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.000]   And so I put myself in a bind where the creative effusive part of my personality wants to make
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.240]   all kinds of commitments, but I can't actually follow through.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.960]   And then that causes me emotional turmoil to feel like I'm letting down on my commitments.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.080]   And so I find that very challenging.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   Well, it was a busy week and then all of a sudden it's upset.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   We're now going to go meet the police and start to find and figure out what's going
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   on.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   Well, we filed the police report and we immediately found out that the license plate had been
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.600]   run by some other police officers over the weekend.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.300]   So after working with the police for a while and finishing the necessary reporting, decided
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.900]   to go around and try to look for it and see if it had been abandoned anywhere near.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.080]   And so after driving around for a little while, we were able to actually find the pickup truck
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.620]   abandoned, but pretty much wrecked.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.620]   Not totally wrecked.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.920]   I haven't heard yet from the insurance adjuster.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.240]   I doubt it'll be totaled, but pretty beat up.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.960]   So for example, the topper was completely gone.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.640]   What it looks like the thieves did is first they stole my pickup truck and then they used
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.800]   it to commit other crimes.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.060]   The police had other crimes, other attempted theft of vehicles and some other things where
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.480]   my vehicle was visible at the scene, which that's of course not a great feeling.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.840]   And in addition to that, they somehow, somewhere, our bet is they tried to use the truck to
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.560]   ram into an ATM.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.960]   Basically they took my pickup truck and they drove it into something crazy hard in the
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.320]   back end.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.520]   So hard that the trailer hitch, which of course I need, was completely destroyed, completely
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.840]   bent down about a foot and a half.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   The tailgate of the truck is missing and the whole big giant commercial truck cap that
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.520]   I had on the back of it is entirely gone.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   Still haven't found it.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.800]   I looked around to try to see if I could salvage it, but still haven't been able to find it.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   And then of course, then the truck is totally scraped up and just a bunch of cosmetic damage.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.680]   So that was my week today.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.960]   And that was yesterday and that started off Monday morning.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.400]   A busy week of activities, far more than I can ever actually accomplish, all of a sudden
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.280]   supplanted by something that is more high profile.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.680]   And of course, everything is dependent upon our date that this week we're planning to
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.520]   hit the road and now that truck is not going to be ready on time.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.320]   So still working through to see whether it gets fixed, working with the insurance company
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.960]   and I don't know the end solution yet.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.040]   But of course that's disruptive.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   Life is disrupted.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.200]   When your stuff gets stolen and you have to then figure out, "Well now, what do I do?"
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.800]   When your stuff is stolen and destroyed by other people, then your life gets disrupted.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.120]   And it can be a big financial impact.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.880]   So I thought today I'd like to share with you how some of the things that I've learned
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.940]   over the years to do and that I have done, which helped me to maintain really a sense
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.800]   of peace through the whole thing.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.520]   A peaceful attitude and to enjoy financial peace, even through all the midst of turmoil.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   Now I will share with you up front that peace and a peaceful life is very important to me.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   It may not be important to you.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.520]   Many people don't seem to care about living a peaceful life.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.800]   But that's really what I want.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   I want to live a peaceful life.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.840]   I'd like to just be left alone to just live.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.280]   That's very important to me.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.600]   I want a minimum of interference from other people.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.760]   I want a minimum of interference from circumstances and I don't want a life that is rocked with
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   drama.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.720]   I want to live a very low drama lifestyle.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.380]   Some people seem to thrive on drama.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.100]   That's about the only way that I can make sense of the lives that some people live.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.940]   Some people thrive on adventure.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:22.740]   But for me a high priority is peace, calm.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:30.080]   I work well from a place of peace and I want to develop more and more of a peaceful personality,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.520]   a peaceful lifestyle as time goes on.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   That's a high priority for me.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   And so that's reflected in my personality and in my decisions and the decisions that
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.280]   I have made.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.840]   Because you'll hear in a moment some of the decisions that I've made and that I encourage
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.640]   you to at least consider.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.440]   And some of those decisions may be at odds with your desire for drama or your desire
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.020]   for a sense of adrenaline coming from your finances.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.520]   Some people love to live so close to the edge that it's a constant drama to check their
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.140]   phone and see if their last check bounced.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.220]   They love to not know what the next phone call is going to be, but I don't.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.420]   So here are some strategies that I've put in place over the years that have helped me
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.460]   to really have, even in the midst of all of the unexpected excitement, to have a peaceful
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.620]   attitude about it and to continue forward.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.820]   There are five total.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.500]   Number one, recognize it's only money.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.980]   This is sometimes hard to actually apply, but here is a maxim by which I that I seek
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.420]   to live out.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:43.620]   If all I have are money problems, frankly, I don't really have any problems.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.940]   I try to be a bit empathetic when saying something like that to people who are right at the edge.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:09:01.140]   But really, truly, if you only have money problems, you really don't have many problems.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:07.540]   When you compare money problems to some of the other problems of life, matters of life
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:18.100]   and death, matters of war and peace, matters of emotional turmoil, money problems, they're
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.540]   not that big of a deal.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.640]   Money problems can be solved.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.540]   No matter how deeply in debt you are, you can always get out.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.220]   You can get out by working your way out.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.940]   You can get out by starting another business.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.780]   You can get out by declaring bankruptcy and starting over.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.940]   You can always get out.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.980]   No matter how deep in the hole you are and what a disaster your unemployment is, you
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.140]   can get another job.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.820]   No matter if you're losing your house, you can find another one.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.820]   It's only money.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.940]   There's a sense in which that's true.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.860]   Now, of course, I affirm that money is important, but it's important to maintain that perspective.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.280]   It's only money.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.700]   It's not a matter of life and death.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.020]   I've matured a lot in the last decade or so because when I was younger, I didn't have
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.080]   that perspective.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.340]   But I first became a financial planner in 2008, and I had the unique privilege of watching
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:24.120]   a number of people who had been very successful lose it all and start over.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.140]   And today I know a number of them that walked through bankruptcy, their real estate empires
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.560]   collapsed, their businesses fell apart.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.680]   They walked through bankruptcy, they started again, and they're doing just fine.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.000]   It's only money.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.620]   So here's what I say.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:48.160]   If I can write a check smaller than $10,000 and solve my problem, it's not worth worrying
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   about.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.720]   If I have to write a check bigger than $10,000, but I can still write a check and solve my
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.360]   problem, okay.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.680]   It's more serious, but still, it's not life and death.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.480]   So number one, I always begin with that perspective.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:12.360]   Number two, I always just start by recognizing I'm going to be okay.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.960]   Now here are some strategies that I have put in place that have convinced me that I'm going
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.160]   to be okay.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:27.720]   First, I know by proof and by testing that I'm okay with very little.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:35.500]   Of equal importance, I know by proof and testing that my wife is okay with very little.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.440]   We have had very few financial resources.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.640]   I've made big business mistakes, big investment mistakes.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.980]   So we've had very limited resources.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:55.800]   And we've proven to one another that in the midst of turmoil, in the midst of problems,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.880]   neither of us is going to freak out and start swiping credit cards.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.280]   We're going to be okay.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.000]   I've also systematically tested my limits over the years to recognize that I'm really
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.200]   okay with very little.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.000]   I've driven very humble vehicles.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.040]   I've lived in very humble places.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:26.920]   I have tested a form of asceticism, seeking to say, "How comfortable can I be with very
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.480]   little?"
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.160]   I like to do this just simply with camping.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.080]   I think it's good for children, for example.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.780]   Go camping and go car camping, but then sometimes just put stuff in a backpack and go way out.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.040]   And you can learn that you can be okay with very little.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.840]   So I know I'm going to be okay.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.640]   I've also seen the lifestyles that so many people live and I can find ways to make them
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.240]   adventurous.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.800]   I read books on how to live as a hobo.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   I've often thought, "If I lost it all and I were just a bum living under a bridge, I'd
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.280]   be a happy bum."
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.680]   I talk to homeless people all the time.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.560]   I could be a happy bum.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.560]   There are so many resources available today if you're a homeless bum living under a bridge.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.860]   I could do well.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.920]   With the entertainment that's accessible to you, for $30 a month that you can get panhandling,
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.960]   you buy a $50 smartphone and pay $30 a month and you have virtually unlimited data access,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.180]   you can have the world's entertainment as a bum living under a bridge.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:35.280]   One time when I was in college, I was curious what it was like to be a panhandler.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.040]   And so a buddy of mine, we went out and we panhandled for an afternoon.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.940]   We wrote signs and I forget the exact syntax we used on the sign, but it was something
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.180]   like "Need money for college" because we were both in college.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.380]   We wrote something honest.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.580]   We didn't say we were broke.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.300]   We didn't say we were desperate.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.660]   We just wrote, "Need money for college."
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.540]   And then we went and stood by the side of the road.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.980]   We panhandled for an afternoon.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.460]   It was one of the most unique experiences I've ever had.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.500]   It really impacted me.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.540]   I got to understand what it was like to be the guy standing on the corner.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.460]   And we did it almost as a lark.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.780]   We were wearing normal clothes, probably flip-flops and khaki shorts or something like that, but
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.180]   just watching people avoid us, watching some people read the sign, enjoying the laugh that
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.860]   people would have as they gave us money.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:32.300]   I couldn't recite accurately the amount of money that we were given with our afternoon
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.820]   of panhandling.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.660]   But it was not insubstantial.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.660]   And so if I were forced to panhandle, I wouldn't go and do it in a serious way.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.140]   I would go and work instead.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.540]   But the point is, it's not that bad.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.180]   I encourage you, take advantage of these opportunities and test yourself.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:58.460]   Do something that makes you uncomfortable and see if you're okay with it.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.500]   Walk a mile in another man's moccasins.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.980]   It would really help you.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.940]   It helps you to understand people and to empathize in a way that perhaps you would find difficult
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.120]   in another context.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.540]   So whatever you're scared of, go and try it.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.860]   And you'll be the one who will gain the most.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.060]   I had a unique experience also when I was in college.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.100]   I traveled to Egypt with some classmates.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.500]   And this was a few years after 9/11.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.580]   And we're coming back from Egypt and I had a few weeks of beard on my face.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.060]   And I thought it would be interesting to see what it would be like to be perceived as a
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.300]   Muslim traveling into the United States.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.460]   And we were traveling through New York City.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:52.660]   So on the trip back from Cairo back to Florida, passing through New York City, I wore a complete
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   galabeya.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.020]   I wore the Egyptian robe.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.840]   I had a beard and I wore a turban the whole time.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.300]   So I looked pretty authentically basically Egyptian Muslim traveling into the United
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   States.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.740]   So I went through airport security.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:15.380]   I watched everybody's eyes and I experienced what it was like to be profiled as a Muslim
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.180]   walking onto an airplane.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:22.740]   And it was fascinating getting onto an airplane in New York City, wearing a long robe and
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.300]   a turban, walking down.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.380]   My seat was at the back of the airplane and walking down the aisle, experiencing everybody
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.300]   looking at me, it impacted me, changed my perspective.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.340]   Those are just a few stories from my life in the past.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:42.680]   But the point of these stories is to say that over time you can cultivate an understanding
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.360]   that I'm okay with very little.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.460]   You can practice, if you usually stay at the five-star hotel, sometimes go and stay at
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.940]   the $10 a night hostel.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:17:00.780]   So you can find out that in traveling I don't only have to stay at the five-star hotel.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:06.260]   Build that resilience in yourself and it can help your self-confidence.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:14.060]   I also have a clear worldview that shapes my acknowledgement that I'm okay with very
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.620]   little.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:22.340]   The Christian religion, which I'm a part of, doesn't teach that money is the number
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.580]   one goal of life.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:32.020]   The US American religion often does, but the Christian religion often doesn't hold that.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.900]   It doesn't teach that money is unimportant, but that it is put into its proper place.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:42.380]   And perhaps in this context, the most important passage that personally shapes my attitude
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.780]   comes from the first book of Timothy.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.820]   The writer says, "But godliness with contentment is great gain.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.420]   For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot take anything out of the world.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.380]   But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.860]   But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.280]   and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.760]   For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.360]   It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.100]   with many pangs.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.440]   But as for you, O man of God, flee these things.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:30.360]   Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, and gentleness."
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:37.960]   So when comparing a financial problem to gaining a sense of its importance, the question I
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.040]   always say is, "Is it going to affect my food and clothing?
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.200]   Because with food and clothing I can be content, and you can as well.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.160]   With food and clothing, I have enough.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.320]   I know people all around the world who don't have enough food and don't have enough clothing,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.360]   but we who live in wealthy societies, we have more food and more clothing than we can handle.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.040]   We spend all of our time talking about how we can get rid of all of our clothing and
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.320]   live with just the bare minimum.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:11.440]   It's rather remarkable how far we have come in terms of the wealth of a society.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:19.000]   And so you can cultivate contentment as a virtue, and then from a place of contentment,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.160]   you can enjoy the full riches of life.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   So that's number two.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.160]   I'm going to be okay.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.000]   I'm okay with very little.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.200]   Food, clothing, that's enough.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   That's enough.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.480]   Nothing more is extra.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   I'm going to enjoy more, but food and clothing is enough.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.680]   Number three, always live within, and preferably below, perhaps even far below, your means.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:56.760]   The times that I have been most stressed have been caused by my own hand, because I didn't
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:04.680]   discipline my desires, rather I indulged them and lived beyond my means.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:12.800]   So by developing discipline and by living within means and below them, or even far below,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.960]   the impact of harm and problems, like your truck getting messed up or your house burning
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:25.360]   down, those things can be of much less impact.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.920]   So live within and preferably below your means.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:39.160]   It was ironic, because on Saturday evening, which was the time at which my truck was being
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:45.960]   stolen, my wife and I were talking about some other RVers that we knew, and we were admiring
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:51.440]   their very beautiful RV that they had bought for their family.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   Now, I don't know anything about their financial situation.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:05.400]   I know nothing, so I'm merely speculating, but I'm aware of enough clues, due to experience
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.120]   as a financial planner, to think that they probably are not multimillionaires at this
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.920]   point in time.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.120]   And they were looking in, bought a beautiful RV, and I just thought to myself, they were
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.760]   going full-time on the road, and I thought, "That would be so stressful, so stressful
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:29.600]   to make big decisions, to buy big fancy things when you haven't tested it."
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.520]   Maybe a year from now, two years from now, I doubt I'll still be RVing, but if I am,
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.000]   maybe I'll buy a big fancy beautiful rig.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.040]   But I'm not going to make big financial commitments when I have little actual knowledge.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.600]   And I'm not going to make big financial commitments that would impact other aspects of my money,
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.900]   of my wealth.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:22:03.200]   So by restricting yourself to lower cost, more frugal options, you buy freedom.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.480]   Remember, if you look at people, and you study the psychology and the behavior of why certain
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:19.840]   people behave as they do, the people who drive a cheaper car and also have money, because
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.720]   many people drive cheap cars because that's all they have, but somebody who drives a cheaper
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:34.600]   car and has money, they don't do it because they don't like the fancier car.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.800]   They do it because they like something else more than they like the fancier car.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.880]   My case, that's freedom and independence.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.440]   So I'd rather have a not very fancy truck.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:53.520]   I'd rather have a not very fancy trailer because what that means to me is more freedom, more
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:02.320]   independence now and 30 years from now, more peace, more rest.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.000]   I don't have to worry about my children destroying a brand new truck.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.480]   We're going to learn to be good stewards of whatever we have.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   That's important.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.200]   I don't want them destroying any truck, but I don't have to freak out if it gets scratched
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.640]   or hit, et cetera.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.440]   So I value that freedom, that simplicity.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:28.960]   And I think it's proven out in terms of when the truck falls, when the truck gets stolen,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.160]   it's going to be okay.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.960]   It's going to be fine because the truck should be, as compared to your total wealth or my
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:48.520]   total wealth, it should be a very small figure, generally speaking.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   Your house, if it burns down, that house should represent something significantly less than
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.080]   all of your wealth.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.120]   I don't know what that right number is.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.200]   I don't know of any way you could make an actual numerical formula.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.880]   So just giving you a gut sense, a gut feeling here.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:15.080]   But a wealthy person who lives in a $10 million house or a $100 million house, you can usually
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.580]   be pretty confident that their total wealth is not $10 million or $100 million.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:27.200]   They may live in a $100 million house, but they probably have several hundreds of millions
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.320]   elsewhere.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.800]   But what's strange is it's not unusual to find somebody who lives in a $250,000 house
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   whose total net wealth is tied up in that house.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.680]   That's very normal.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.280]   It's also very broke.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.680]   So keep the stuff.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.020]   Don't diversify your money.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.560]   Don't let all your money be tied up in a single thing.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.280]   Because that way if your truck is stolen or your house burns down or your vacation cottage
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:04.320]   is ransacked or whatever the case is, it's not a wipeout blow.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.040]   Keep it low.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.360]   Don't allow yourself to have all your money tied up in one thing that can be destroyed.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.880]   Live within your means, preferably well below your means.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.280]   The only reason I would hedge here is there are people who, for example, using the RV
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.400]   example, because that's the stage I'm at, there are people who are looking and saying,
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.480]   "I don't have a lot of money, but I'm going to trade in my rent for this motorhome."
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.760]   I understand that, but it's still a dangerous place to be and you should work as quickly
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:41.080]   as possible to make sure that that motorhome is only a small portion of your total wealth.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.440]   Buy right.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.600]   Go slow.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.080]   Be careful.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.120]   One of the big benefits of living below your means is you can always get out with a minimum
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.320]   of stress.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.820]   If you get in and you find out, "Hey, I don't like this," two months from now I may be speaking
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.120]   to you in front of a microphone saying, "Not for us."
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.860]   In that situation, put stuff up for sale.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.420]   Should be able to get most of my money out of it.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.220]   Put stuff up for sale.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.220]   Move on.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.220]   That's number three.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.460]   Live within and below your means.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.940]   Number four, maintain spending flexibility.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:24.220]   Most financial problems can be solved fairly quickly if you have spending flexibility.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:34.060]   The challenge is many of us commit our budgets far in advance.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.820]   By committing our budgets far in advance, we don't have a lot of flexibility.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:47.420]   I've encouraged in various occasions that you do a mental game.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.800]   Consider the fact that you and perhaps your spouse, both of you just lost your job.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:04.460]   If you had to cut your lifestyle to the bone, go as deep as you could, how would that impact
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   you?
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.460]   What would you do?
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:13.200]   How could you cut?
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.580]   If you could cut really low, you've got a lot of flexibility.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:22.500]   Just because you could cut doesn't mean you have to cut, but the knowledge that you could
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.460]   cut can help you to get through most problems.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:35.460]   If you have a car breakdown and you cut other expenses dramatically and then you then come
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:42.760]   back and increase your expenses after you replenish your emergency fund, that's a much
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.740]   less stressful way to do it than to all of a sudden now have to pay back a loan to the
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:53.500]   mechanic or the car place.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.260]   In any expense, you can't avoid all expenses.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.940]   If you have rent, you can't avoid paying that rent, but hopefully that rent is as low as
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.220]   you can reasonably make happen as compared to your income.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:14.340]   But many other expenses can actually be canceled in an extreme situation.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.220]   I'm allergic to contracts.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.740]   The reason I'm allergic to contracts is because I've been burned.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:31.220]   I usually find that I'd rather pay a little bit more if I had to in order to avoid a contract
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.160]   than to be in a place of a contract.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.980]   You can't avoid contracts everywhere, but wherever you can, I encourage you to avoid
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.900]   them.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.580]   Perhaps I'm uniquely sensitive to this because so much of my personal income has been highly
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.300]   fluctuating for the last decade.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.940]   There have been times when I made a ton of money and there have been times when all the
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.620]   money that I made just flowed right out and I made no money.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.280]   One of the unique attributes of the financial planning business is called chargebacks or
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:10.000]   I've forgotten the word of what it is, basically the equivalent of a chargeback where let's
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.520]   say that you sell an insurance policy and you get paid your commission.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.120]   Well, you get paid your commission up front usually.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.720]   And then all of a sudden, your client that loved the insurance policy they bought, four
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.640]   months in decides they're going to cancel it.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.560]   Well, they cancel it and all of a sudden, two-thirds of your commission is charged back
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.880]   to you and you go into the negative.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:42.640]   And until you have a big enough stable form of income, in the financial world with financial
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.100]   product sales and financial planning, you can basically never trust that you're going
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:51.160]   to get paid next month because you don't know what's going to happen.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:57.080]   There may be times and there were times when I would write 10 insurance policies during
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.960]   a pay period.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.840]   And then in the next pay period, a giant one was canceled and all the commissions disappeared
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.120]   from the other nine because the giant one was charged back.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:16.280]   So that may have made me uniquely allergic to contracts, but I found it to be very helpful.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.560]   In thinking about RV lifestyle, I read several books from people who were teaching others
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:27.600]   how to travel full-time and live in an RV on social security, very small payments, $600
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.560]   a month, et cetera.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:35.100]   And one of the unique benefits of RV living is the flexibility.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.640]   If you have a lot of money, you can put a lot of fuel in your gas tank and you can go
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   far.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.680]   If you don't have a lot of money, you can park and wait until you have more.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.840]   If you have a lot of money, you can stay in fancy parks.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.440]   If you don't have a lot of money, you can stay in a Walmart parking lot.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.640]   And so RVers have the unique ability of being able to expand their lifestyle and contract
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.300]   it as needed.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:03.240]   So when you read about these RVers who are living on $800 a month, $1,000 a month, $1,200
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.200]   a month of social security, you see that when their engine blows up, they can recover from
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   that.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.760]   Because then for the next few months until they've replenished their emergency funds,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.240]   they live super cheap.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.760]   You can apply that whether you live in an RV or not.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.320]   Maintain spending flexibility.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.480]   Avoid debt.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.760]   Avoid contracts.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.580]   Keep a creative mind.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.120]   Think about how you can solve problems with less money.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.020]   And be humble.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.480]   Be willing to be humble.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   And number five, insure well.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.040]   Insure well.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.480]   Insurance is wonderful.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.420]   It's one of, in my opinion, one of the most marvelous inventions that we've come up with.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.720]   Insurance is wonderful.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:32:01.080]   It can take what could otherwise be a disaster, a major setback, and turn it into a simple
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:08.600]   speed bump.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:15.640]   If you first do these other things, then you can afford the insurance payments.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:23.160]   And that financial tool will help to smooth so many things out in life that you don't
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.080]   experience the lows.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.800]   So many people will go and they'll buy something like an expensive RV, but because the payments
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.000]   are so high, they don't insure it very well.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.320]   And then something catastrophic happens, and they're left making payments on a vehicle
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.560]   that was destroyed.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.760]   If you buy a cheaper RV, or a cheaper car, or a cheaper house, or a cheaper motorcycle,
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:00.000]   or whatever, and you insure it well, you can afford it.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.360]   Then if you have a total loss, it's not a huge problem.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.280]   That's thankfully the case with even the truck that I have.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.440]   It's well insured.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.880]   And so because it's well insured, I'm covered.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.240]   We'll work things out with a quality insurance company.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:26.520]   We'll make a fair deal, and either we'll fix the truck, or I'll buy another one.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.640]   So insure well.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.080]   If there's something that would keep you up at night because you can't afford to lose
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.160]   it, insure it.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:44.240]   Or if you're going into circumstances that you're not quite sure about, check into insurance.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.240]   If you're going to go traveling and you want to wear your fancy ring, insure it.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.080]   Just insure it for a year.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.920]   That way if it gets stolen, it'll be restored to you.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.680]   If you have some valuable stuff in your house, insure it.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.240]   If you have a vehicle, insure it.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.440]   Many times we sit down and we try to figure out what's the cheapest thing that I can get.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   I've done that.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.720]   I do the calculations.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.520]   For example, with vehicle insurance, generally I want to have vehicles that if they were
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.120]   totally destroyed, it's not that big of a deal, I'll just buy another one.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.960]   And so usually buying liability only insurance can often make sense, especially if you're
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.200]   dealing with less costly vehicles.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.400]   But price it the other way and then ask yourself, assume it was a total loss.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.800]   Would I be freaked out?
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.200]   Would I be losing sleep?
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.080]   If the answer's yes, insure it.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.240]   Insure well.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.880]   Think if you build these things over time, you can build a lifestyle of financial peace.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:58.560]   You can enjoy that financial peace and I'm convinced that that financial peace will improve
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.480]   many other areas of your life.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.640]   I've very rarely seen a marriage relationship that was difficult.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:13.880]   I've rarely seen such a relationship improved by financial turmoil.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:22.200]   I've very rarely seen children who are going through difficult experiences in life, who
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:28.120]   are really struggling in something health-wise, physically, psychologically.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:36.240]   I've very rarely seen those children have that experience improved by financial turmoil
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.840]   in their family.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.360]   I've very rarely seen somebody whose personal life was difficult.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.720]   They were experiencing depression.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.040]   They were struggling with confidence or struggling with a health issue.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:36:03.320]   I have very rarely seen that circumstance improved by financial turmoil and catastrophe.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:10.480]   If you say that's too obvious, well, consider again.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.580]   You can't guarantee that you never face financial turmoil.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:19.600]   You can't guarantee that you don't experience total loss, but you can protect against so
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:26.080]   many things and you can protect against the most likely ones.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.640]   So those are my five tips for you.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   It's been quite the adventure.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.400]   We'll be on the road just as soon as we can.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.360]   But one more comment.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.640]   One of the things I've also learned to do is to make fewer commitments.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:44.480]   We have intentionally not established a firm calendar schedule of all the places we're
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.160]   going to be because I knew there are too many things outside of my control.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   I couldn't be there.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.280]   I can't plan that far ahead.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.360]   I can't say six months from now I'm going to be in California on this date for this
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.740]   particular event with my listening audience.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.920]   And so even just in your own lifestyle, if you can pull back on some of those things,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.580]   then you can deal with the bumps in the roads that come along.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.580]   That's enough for today.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.580]   Number one, it's only money.
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.580]   It's not life or death.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.840]   If you have money problems, they're problems, especially if they're over $10,000, they're
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.180]   problems, but you can solve them.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.920]   Money problems in the grand scheme of things are not such a big deal compared to some other
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.800]   problems that you might have.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.240]   Number two, I'm going to be okay.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   You're going to be okay.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.200]   And I'm going to be okay because I'm okay with very little.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.320]   Cultivate contentment.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.760]   Food and clothing?
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.680]   I'm set.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.440]   Beyond that, everything extra, it's just extra.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.120]   Number three, live within and preferably below your means.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:53.000]   If you do that, you may trade in the fanciest rig.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.360]   You may trade in the most beautiful house on the block.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.400]   What you gain is peace.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.320]   If you value peace, give it a shot.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:12.240]   Don't view yourself as being deprived because you have a simpler home or a smaller car.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.360]   You're not deprived.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.360]   You're blessed.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.440]   You're in peace instead of a fancier thing.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:27.720]   Number four, seek to maintain spending flexibility.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.800]   Develop your allergies towards contracts, towards fixed payments.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:40.120]   Develop your allergy towards debt, towards things that will take away your flexibility,
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.700]   lock you in.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.880]   Number five, insure well.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.720]   If there's something that would keep you up at night, if you lost it, if it just disappeared,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.160]   insure it and insure it well.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.960]   Cost a little bit of money up front, but if you don't have it, well, it's not the end
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   of the world.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.600]   Whereas, if you lose the thing, you'll be happy that you insured well.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.920]   I'll be back with you soon.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:13.680]   Over the next week or two, just a closing note, I very much have wanted to...
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.080]   You've noticed that the schedule at Radical Personal Finance has been up and down, just
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.600]   doing the very best that I can.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.000]   My hope is that most of my...
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.560]   As soon as we get out of here, I'll be able to stick to a more regular release of shows,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   more regular structuring.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.000]   I've got all kinds of things I want to do.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.560]   I'm just doing the very best that I can and I'm thankful for you for sticking with me
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.120]   through this time of transition and I'm excited to come and see you out on the road.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.960]   If you've written to me, if you've invited me to come visit you, please know I have every
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   one of those.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.280]   I've just replied to almost none of those.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.560]   So when I can, I will respond.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.840]   Thank you all so much for listening and I'll be back with you soon.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.080]   Don't just dream about paradise, live it with Fiji Airways.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.200]   Escape the ordinary with Fiji Airways Global Beat the Rush Sale.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:07.160]   Immerse yourself in white sandy beaches or dive deep into coral reefs.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:14.280]   Fiji Airways has flights to Nadi starting at just $748 for light and just $798 for value.
