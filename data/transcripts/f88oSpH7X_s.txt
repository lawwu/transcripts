[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   We talked about sonship with Dr. Don Carson last Friday.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.920]   And Pastor John, a lot of people emphasize
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.680]   who we are in Christ as an important way
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.080]   to help us overcome our personal discouragements
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.560]   and triumph over personal sin struggles
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200]   and to walk in fullness of joy, of course.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.440]   But in your ministry over the years,
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.560]   you seem to strike a different note.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.640]   You talk about God being the gospel
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.200]   or about enjoying God as our ultimate happiness.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.760]   So how do you work with these two categories
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.840]   of number one, our identity in Christ,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.080]   and number two, our enjoyment of God himself?
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.720]   How do you balance those two?
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.320]   - It is true and a great truth
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.320]   that we are, that who we are in Christ
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.640]   is often the motif of counselors
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.560]   to help liberate people.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   I think that's great, to help liberate people
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.920]   who are stuck in bondage to sin and depression
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.040]   and dysfunctional relationships and we wanna help them.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.340]   Do you know who you are in Christ?
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.500]   I think that's great as far as it goes.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.780]   We are perfect in Christ.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080]   We are loved in Christ.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.120]   We are accepted in Christ.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.120]   We are, yes, enjoyed by God in Christ.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.440]   And by God's spirit, we are becoming in practice,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.680]   in reality, what we are in principle in Christ,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.840]   more and more beautiful, like Christ.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.760]   I don't wanna underplay those unspeakable truths at all.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.480]   The question for me is,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.000]   is that the ultimate goal of our salvation?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.280]   And the answer, I think, is no.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   Those things are true of us so that we may be freed
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.920]   from the despair of damnation
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.240]   and from the paralysis of despair
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   and so have capacities suitable to approach
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   and behold and enjoy God fully.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.640]   Who we are in Christ is a means.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.440]   It's a means, not an end.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   All of that to us and in us is meant to fit us
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.920]   to make God our all-satisfying end.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.480]   Everything that happens to us,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.040]   everything that happens in us for good,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   making, giving us a kind of identity,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.560]   all of it is designed to make us the kind of beings
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.160]   who can see and enjoy God perfectly.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   And the tragic thing about modern self-oriented life,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.280]   popular thinking, counseling, preaching,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.440]   education, entertainment,
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   is that it all leaves us without our ultimate treasure,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.080]   our ultimate reason for being,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.720]   namely to know and understand and perceive
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.360]   and experience and delight in God himself.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.440]   God is subtly treated as a means
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   to what we really finally want,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.280]   namely I wanna be something, I wanna be someone.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.240]   Now, this was really helpful for me to see.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.120]   I'm able to affirm the whole scripture, I think,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240]   that speaks of who we are in Christ
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   and delight in the truth of it.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.040]   But if I stop there or if we stop there,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.200]   I think we treat the end or the final goal of redemption
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.640]   or the ultimate thing in which we rejoice
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440]   as something less than God, namely our own becoming,
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.800]   and we become idolaters.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.320]   So the crucial question for me is
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.560]   where is my final happiness?
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.120]   The way I asked it one time in a passion talk at Passion
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   was what's the bottom of your joy?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680]   Is it being something or someone,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.560]   or is it God, seeing and knowing and admiring
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.040]   and enjoying God?
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.920]   One of them does not cancel out the other.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   That's so crucial to say.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.400]   I don't want anyone to hear me say
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.760]   that I'm canceling out the preciousness
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.400]   or the importance of becoming or being.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   It is a glorious truth that we will be like Christ,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   that we will share his glory,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.040]   that we will shine like the sun, Jesus said,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.400]   in the kingdom of our Father.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.320]   We will sit on the throne with Jesus, it says in Revelation.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.520]   We'll rule the nations.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.920]   We're gonna judge angels.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.960]   You can't say anything greater about us
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.320]   except to call us God, which the Bible's not going to do.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   All of this is true and gloriously true
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.600]   and has not been revealed to make us sad.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.920]   We shouldn't read those statements and say,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   well, yeah, John Piper said not to get
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.800]   too excited about those.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.080]   Are you kidding me?
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.320]   You haven't begun to feel as excited as you should be
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   that one day you're gonna judge angels,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.920]   one day you're gonna rule nations
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.080]   and sit on the throne with Jesus and shine like the sun.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.200]   I mean, your emotions haven't even begun to rise
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.640]   to the point of excitement about those things.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   But the question is, is that the sweetest ground of my joy
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.880]   or is God the ultimate and sweetest ground of my joy?
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.760]   And I think if we get them backwards,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.880]   we're gonna hurt ourselves and not just dishonor God.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   Our souls are not made to find ultimate joy in the words,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.840]   "Well done, good and faithful servant."
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.960]   I mean, Seuss Lewis wrote a great sermon
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.460]   that that's the weight of glory.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.720]   And I wanna say, amen to hear those words.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.120]   I'm sure a few things will make me cry like those words,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   that anybody could regard John Piper's paltry ministry
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.320]   and service of the King of Kings as a well done
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   will be beyond measure in value except for one thing.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.960]   We're not made to find ultimate joy in being glorious,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.240]   in having done a great job.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.320]   We are made to find ultimate joy in God.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.360]   God is the infinite value in the universe.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.320]   Nothing rises to the level of God's worth.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.120]   We were made to see and savor ultimate worth.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   All the glorious things in us ultimately fit us for that.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.960]   That's what glorification is.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.880]   I'll say that again.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.640]   That's what glorification is,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   being what we must be in order to maximally enjoy God
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.020]   in the fullest way forever.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.000]   - That is glorious.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.720]   God is the gospel and that is,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.600]   he is the sweetest thing in the universe.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that wonderful reminder.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.520]   And this concludes episode number 899,
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.160]   899, which means tomorrow we're gonna hit episode number 900
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.560]   in the podcast series, which is just incredible.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.320]   And when you do a podcast like this one for so long,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   and especially with the topics that we talk about,
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.160]   where we tackle the breadth of theological dilemmas
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.960]   and we wrestle with so many serious ethical questions
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.560]   and things in the news,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   it raises the question of whether or not
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.240]   we can overthink the Christian life.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.880]   And if we can, how so?
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.320]   Tomorrow I'm gonna ask Pastor John that very question.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.000]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.120]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
