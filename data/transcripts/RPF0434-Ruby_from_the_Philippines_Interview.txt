[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.280]   Ruby, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   Oh, thank you.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.400]   So I'm excited about this interview because you are a relatively new immigrant to the
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   United States.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   Correct.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   And I love immigrant stories.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.880]   So I think unfortunately, white US Americans are probably destined for poverty in general
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.080]   and immigrants seem to be destined for wealth for many reasons.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.120]   That's obviously an overstatement, but I very much always love to hear the stories of people
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.320]   who are moving to the United States and all the things that they're learning because you've
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.520]   immigrated from the Philippines.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   Correct.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.280]   So your perspective is going to be so refreshing to hear.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280]   So tell me the story.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   How did you and your husband wind up in the United States?
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960]   So for me, I worked in a multinational bank.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.440]   So they gave me an opportunity to move to Jacksonville, Florida, where I currently live
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   right now because they're like expanding their operations there.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.120]   So they're like, "Would you like to come to the US?"
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.680]   And here I was thinking, "Hell yeah," because in the back of mind, it's money.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.360]   I come from a relatively third world country.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.840]   We're not really rich.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.080]   By the way, I have been to the Philippines.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.720]   The fact that I'm moving a few thousand miles away to earn a bit more money and finally
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.400]   get some time back to myself to travel and do other things, and there's a whole lot more
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.920]   opportunity in the US, that was a good opportunity for me.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.320]   And my husband, he actually was born and raised in what was called Czechoslovakia.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.560]   His parents entered the green card lottery when he was nine.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.480]   They eventually won it when he was 12 and then he moved here.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.560]   So we met each other through work.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   Here in the United States?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   Yes.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   Wow.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   Okay.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   I thought you had moved together.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   I thought he was Filipino.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   No.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   So you have a Filipino background.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   He has a Czech background.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   No, he's actually Slovak.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   Okay, Slovak.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   Yes.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   Slovakian background.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.960]   When you were in the Philippines, was the bank that you're working for an American bank
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.560]   or was it a Filipino bank?
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.040]   It's actually a German bank.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   Okay.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000]   And so were you recruited to come to the US?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.240]   And the reason I'm asking, sorry for interrupting, that's not common.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.080]   Obviously there are many people in the Philippines who work for large multinational corporations,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.640]   but to be able to be offered a position to the United States, you did a lot.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.160]   You've obviously done some excellent work that got you that opportunity.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.840]   So the backstory of that was in 2007, I was a recent graduate and the bank asked if I
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.080]   would join their graduate program.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   And here I was, I have no banking background, I'm a computer scientist, why would you still
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   want me?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.400]   And they're like, "No, no, no, we can train you to learn the bank and then you can choose
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.120]   which department you want to be in eventually."
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.800]   I landed into a job into accounting and my boss at the time decided to leave the bank
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.640]   and move to Singapore.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.840]   So there was an opportunity a year later to go to the UK and they picked me.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.360]   So I showed I can do what my boss was doing in a relatively short period of time, they
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   were happy with that.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.680]   They invited me back to the UK in 2011 and then after that I'm like, "I'm not going to
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   go home."
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.400]   If they find an opportunity for me anywhere in the world, I'll be more than willing to
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.520]   move.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.480]   And then two years later they came back and then went, "Would you like to come to America?"
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   At first they were offering me India, but I'm like, "I don't think so."
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.640]   So America seems more of an ambition because it's like the American dream, right?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.200]   So it's very hard to come to America, to be honest.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.880]   So I said, "Unless you get married to an American that you know from abroad."
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.980]   But getting recruited, wow.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.880]   So I took the opportunity and then just landed the gig.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   Awesome.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   Congratulations.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.560]   Why did you not want to go back to the Philippines?
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.600]   It started when I was in the UK, when I was sent there.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.640]   All these people around me were talking about traveling.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.360]   So one girl in particular, she's still working with me, she struck a chord in me when she
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.000]   asked me the question, "Have you been to Santorini?"
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.400]   I'm like, "Wow, that sounds so foreign.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.600]   I've never heard of it."
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   And she was describing how beautiful it is and it didn't cost them a lot of money and
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.560]   they only went for a weekend.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.600]   And something clicked in the back of my head saying, "If these people who are just a bit
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.780]   older than me can do all these things, why can't I?"
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.000]   And then I realized, "Oh, I'm not earning as much money as these guys back home, but
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.520]   then I really wanted to make it work."
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   So that's how I really wanted to get out of the Philippines and then try my luck somewhere.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.200]   Because we are putting in the same amount of time working at the same company, let's
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.600]   say from nine to six, minus the travel time to and from work, but I get paid less than
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.480]   20% of what my peers in the first world countries are working for.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.160]   And I'm like, "Well, if all our time is equal, why can't we be paid as fairly as everybody
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   else?"
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   Did you know that when you were in the Philippines?
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.840]   I kind of landed it by mistake because I saw the contract that said, "If you bring this
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.640]   work from the UK to the Philippines, this is how much we are going to pay you, the Philippine
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   counterpart."
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.960]   And it was a substantial amount of money, but I don't see it because most of the money
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.360]   is being pocketed by the company as their profit.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.160]   So I'm like, "Well, if I can't work in the Philippines, why can't I just move somewhere
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   else?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.400]   I know it's hard, but I'm going to try to make it work."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.240]   I don't know.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.720]   My knowledge of Filipino culture is more than some other Asian countries because I've spent
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.360]   a while there, I spent about a month in the Philippines.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:45.560]   But one of the hallmarks of the Philippines is a lot of Filipinos expatriate and go abroad
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   to find work.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:54.200]   The economic opportunities in the Philippines are relatively much smaller and it seems like
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.000]   so many people go abroad.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.960]   And the reputation of Filipino workers around the world is fantastic in terms of Filipino
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.280]   workers in high demand in a lot of different industries all around the world.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.520]   So I've often wondered about what it would be like to go abroad and then think about
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.760]   coming back and exactly what you're describing.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.140]   So that's the thing.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.560]   Most Filipinos go abroad, but one thing we lack is financial education.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.600]   Most people who go abroad send money back home to their relatives, but the relatives
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.840]   back home do nothing.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   They just spend the money.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.520]   They go out shopping, they have severe lifestyle inflation, and then the dad or the mom or
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.720]   whoever's abroad comes back home and then sees just a big house full of stuff and they
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   go, "Did you not save for our retirement?"
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.240]   I do want to go back home and live in the Philippines to retire, but then if you spend
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.400]   it all on stuff, then I'm forced to go back to where I am from and work a bit more.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.680]   So I'm like, I do not agree with that culture, which is kind of odd of me because I was an
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.000]   outlier back home too.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.440]   Because I'm like, if you had this opportunity and you can earn, let's say, 80% more than
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.960]   what you are earning back home, why don't you want to save it for your retirement?
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.720]   Why would you want to work until you're 65?
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.760]   Or why would you want to spend a long time away from your family and then only to come
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.560]   back and not have any retirement savings?
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.800]   So we call them like bums back home where your wife is just busy shopping her way or
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.440]   you're... yeah.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.480]   So I'm like, I don't agree with this culture.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.560]   I don't think it's fair because the other guy is sacrificing so much.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.120]   Did you say that you would like to retire back to the Philippines?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.800]   We would like to retire in a lower cost country, be it the Philippines or Slovakia.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.560]   We haven't decided yet if we're going to do it, but with the geographic arbitrage, I think
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   it does work.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:59.360]   Because it's good to work in the UK or the US where you earn so much more working and
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.200]   then going to like a dollar a day for food in Thailand or something.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.720]   I think it's great.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.960]   So tell me about your and your husband's plans and your financial independence goals and
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.240]   your journey.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.160]   So actually my husband was the one who found financial independence.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.560]   He was browsing blogs when I was so stressed out one day, I was so burnt out.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.920]   I'm like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.800]   And so he Googled something funny.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.680]   He's like, how do I make money without working?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.960]   So I think he landed like blogs that say like, this is like how you do it, passive income,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.640]   portfolio and like index funds.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.800]   So he started reading more and was starting to tell me about it.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.680]   At the time I came to America, I didn't know what the 401k was.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.920]   I didn't know what an IRA was.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.800]   I didn't know what Vanguard was.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.880]   The IRA was putting all my money in the bank account, which is what I was used to in the
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.120]   Philippines, which is like paying what, 0.05% if you're lucky, which is like nothing.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.720]   You're basically losing money every year.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.920]   So he was the one who introduced me to this.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.040]   So we slowly started maxing out our 401k, which we are doing now.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:14.400]   We are going to max out our IRAs, Roth IRA, and then I convinced him to open up an HSA
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.000]   instead of the PPO that he was doing.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   So yeah, and then we're slowly doing rental properties.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.440]   So we bought like our house a year and a half ago and we bought another house like three
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   months ago.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.080]   It was great.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.760]   You've been in the US for three years?
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   Yes.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   And you own two houses?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   Yes.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.320]   And you're maxing out your 401ks and Roth IRAs and opening an HSA?
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.000]   Yeah, that's like, oh my God, that's like an American dream, right?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.160]   I'm like, here I was working in the Philippines for seven years and I know I don't even have
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.780]   enough money for a down payment for a house of my own.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.300]   So I'm like, wow, what a difference three years would make.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.040]   And then I also learned about travel hacking, which we didn't have in the Philippines.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.800]   So I'm like, wow, America really can like open doors for you if you know like where
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.200]   to look for it.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   So it is true.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.640]   The American dream really is true.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.560]   Do you and your husband have a specific timeline that you're working towards?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   So we want to retire like since I started late because I only went to America when I'm
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.160]   nearly 30.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.640]   So we have a timeline of like 15 years.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.760]   So we're like 12 to 15 years away from FI.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.480]   So we really started like pushing ourselves, like seriously doing this like two years ago.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.440]   So he's like, well, it's better late than never.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   And here we are reading like all these articles saying, oh, we retired at 33.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:43.120]   And I'm like, darn it, we're never going to do it.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.080]   There is probably an over amount of attention paid to young retirees where it's almost a
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.160]   competition to say who can do it the fastest.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   And I'm like, oh, yeah.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.200]   And when I was 22, I didn't know what I was doing was earning 20% of what I was earning
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   now.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.680]   So I'm like, give me some slack.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.420]   And tell me your goal is to continue saving and your 401ks and your Roth IRAs.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.760]   And then your goal is to continue accumulating rental real estate.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   Is that the plan?
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   Yes, for now.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   And then like when we're done with like seven properties, and once we reach our FI number,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.300]   which is like one mil, we're going to travel the world.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.640]   So that's what I really, really want to do.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.280]   I have always wanted to travel.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.000]   But like in the Philippines, we had budget airline carriers.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.480]   So I would save a substantial amount of my salary and just fly somewhere for a weekend.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.580]   Because we have this opportunity that our parents didn't have when we were younger.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.220]   Because they said that airfare and everything else travel related is like an expense that
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.180]   is too much for them.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.420]   So I'm gonna like push for it.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.580]   Where and how do you and your husband live?
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.740]   So we live in Jacksonville, Florida, which is relatively low cost.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.340]   We don't have state tax in Florida.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.340]   State income tax?
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.100]   We do have federal tax and sales tax, but pretty much it's a low cost area.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.100]   We like it.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.900]   You live in a small apartment or you live in one of your houses?
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.700]   We bought a townhouse.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.420]   So we don't really have single family homes, but we live in a townhouse, which is like
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.060]   we pay an HOA and they maintain everything outside for us.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.620]   So we only maintain the inside.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.620]   Nice.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.160]   We're here at Camp Mustache, Southeast 2017.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.300]   Have you done any other or implemented any of Mr. Money Mustache's other advice?
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.660]   We are a one car family.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.660]   Nice.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.660]   How do you manage that?
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.140]   At first it was a headache because it's also like when my husband was working in a different
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.620]   building than I was, we have to coordinate perfectly.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.140]   Every day he would drive himself to work and I would get the car and I would drive myself
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.480]   to the other building and then come back to pick him up.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.580]   So there's times when I have to work late, he would have to wait for me because we're
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.580]   only one car.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:03.140]   And it doesn't make sense to do Uber because that's $10 every day when he could just sit
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.260]   at work and then do more productive things.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.620]   So we try to make the schedules work.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.720]   That's awesome.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.860]   When you look around at the US American culture as an immigrant and being married to an immigrant,
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.860]   what do you think?
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.260]   What do you think about white people like me and what we do?
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:27.860]   Those who are not in the FI circle, I think it's a bit of too much.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.020]   Too much house, too much land, too much stuff.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.060]   You would see all these sales and while if you need something and buy something on sale
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:47.420]   then that's good, but stocking up on 200 pieces of toilet paper when it's on sale and using
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:53.460]   coupons, the opportunity cost of your time is not really worth it.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.540]   So that's what I noticed.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:02.060]   And then people have huge houses here, which it's okay, but to each their own.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.460]   What was the most shocking thing to you about the US American culture?
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.460]   Oh, TV.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.460]   How do you mean?
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.100]   You guys like watching a lot of TV.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.700]   All my colleagues would go home after work and then just watch three hours of TV every
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.180]   single day.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.020]   And then I was thinking, well, three hours could be a good side hustle time where you
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.940]   could do freelance and then earn more and then put that towards your retirement savings.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.540]   I realized I have a lot more time in the US than when I had back home because I don't
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.100]   commute as much.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.340]   So yeah, you get more productive use of your time here in the US, but I think most people
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.300]   are just not using it wise enough.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.780]   So that's just me.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.020]   How do you interact with your family in the Philippines?
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.140]   Skype, Facebook.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.180]   So are they jealous of you?
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.180]   No.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:59.780]   My mom is very happy that I moved because, as I said, it's very hard to move to America
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.460]   organically like I did.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:10.140]   Most people marry into an American guy or a girl and then just try to become one.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.700]   And then they have severe lifestyle inflation when they come here because they're like,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.500]   "Oh my gosh, all these things that I could get."
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:22.100]   I was watching this show on TLC, The 90 Day Fiancé, where there's a Filipino girl who
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.180]   kind of came from a background close to me, but she married an American guy, but then
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.020]   she wants this huge 3,000 square foot home.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.140]   And I'm like, "Dude, you can't even afford that.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.460]   You don't even have a job yet.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.140]   You just came to America and you're demanding all this.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.620]   Please, please don't cast a bad light to us.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.620]   We're not all like that."
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620]   Of course you're not.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.580]   There's a TV, you've got to have some drama.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.100]   Tell us about your website and what you're doing there.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:54.740]   So it's like a journey to financial independence because we really want to do full-time travel.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.900]   So we do a journey to full-time travel through financial independence.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.380]   Because a lot of the travel blogs that we read is like, "Oh, quit your job and do this
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.100]   and that so you can travel the world."
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:12.140]   We don't agree with that because there are other ways to travel the world full-time,
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.160]   but we don't have to quit our job right now.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.220]   What if we do it with a purpose, like getting to FI?
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:25.080]   So with blogging, you can come and go whenever the wind blows.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.580]   So with these other bloggers, they're like, "Oh, quit your job."
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.700]   I'm like, "No, we are doing it with a purpose.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.460]   If we reach FI, then we have enough reserves coming back to."
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.620]   It's not just like, "Oh, just because I don't like working anymore."
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:45.540]   So it's just a bit of a sacrifice now by working now and then eventually not needing the money
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.580]   in the future to work.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:55.020]   Are you aware of anybody in the Tagalog or Cebuano-speaking writing world in the Philippines
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.420]   who's talking about personal finance the way we do in the English-speaking world?
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.500]   There was this one guy who these people follow.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.940]   I think his name is -- I forgot his blog.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:13.980]   But he would be teaching them savings, like save a peso a day and you'll save 365 more
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.380]   than last year.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.740]   I'm like, "But that's really not enough."
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.820]   But if it's like slowly teaching financial education to the Philippines, then that's
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.980]   great because we never really get taught this at school and as I said, most people in the
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.580]   Philippines don't really know financial education.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.540]   So I'm like, "That's a step."
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.860]   So if these people still continue to just listen to them and then apply the steps that
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:44.820]   he's outlining, then hopefully more and more people back home would be more aware of what's
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:51.060]   around them and that everything has a time and a money consequence.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.540]   So it's not just about the money, but it's also an opportunity cost.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.020]   Have you thought about doing anything in that market to help people?
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.220]   Not yet back home.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.900]   No, that's like -- everybody back home is buzzing about travel blogs.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:12.060]   There's this one couple who travels the world full-time and they were backpackers and now
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.620]   they're luxury travelers because 200,000 people follow them.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.860]   I'm like, "Of course, you're going to get luxury travel and sponsors because 200,000
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.620]   people want your life now."
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.540]   So it's all about the soap opera culture back home.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.820]   If they see a rags to riches story, they would actually follow you more.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.660]   They don't really want to be educated this much.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.380]   So if you start preaching to them, they're going to go, "I don't want to listen to
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.380]   you."
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:44.500]   So if you show them it could work, then maybe they will start to follow in your footsteps.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.140]   But if you try to teach them, they might not listen to you.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.660]   Well, I'd love to see you work.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:20:00.500]   When I travel, one of the challenges that I often think about is I've been so richly
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:09.700]   blessed and we, especially in the English speaking world, have been so richly blessed
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.620]   with a cultural heritage of knowledge and of insight.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:22.220]   And we draw from that cultural heritage for many of our things, especially in this aspect
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.780]   of finance.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:29.980]   And often when I look at other cultures and other countries, I look and I think, "How
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:36.380]   could some of what I know or what I do be applied and how could it be taught?"
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:43.940]   Because there's just this massive disparity in wealth that exists in the Western world
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.220]   versus many other parts of the world.
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.860]   And I don't know.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.060]   I don't know how to crack that nut, but I want to see more and more people like you
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:59.900]   work on it and try to seek to help to invest into people all around the world in other
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:07.300]   languages because the charlatans, the scammers, the scammers are doing it.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   They're everywhere.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.700]   No, but there aren't enough people going and crossing over and saying, "Listen, let me
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.700]   teach you the principles.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.580]   Let me put it out there."
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:22.780]   And then profiling the success and demonstrating in a culturally relevant way, meaning, "Okay,
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.980]   you're in this place, in this culture, with these opportunities.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.580]   Here's how you take the principles and apply them in the local culture."
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.540]   So I'd love to see you and many more people in my audience take that and translate that
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.460]   into other cultures and do that.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.100]   I always look and think about it, but I don't know how to do it.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.100]   But I'm fascinating.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.780]   I want to profile and support people who are.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.500]   So your blog is ajourneywelove.com.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.820]   Any other actions that you want my audience to take after hearing this interview or any
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.300]   other final pieces of advice you'd like to give?
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:03.340]   Well, as JD Roth said, always have a goal and you have something to look forward to.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.740]   Like our goal is what was started as a hobby eventually became our full-time goal, which
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.380]   is we want to travel full-time.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.980]   We don't want to be shackled to a job that would make us work nine to six.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.620]   So if you can find the steps to reach that goal, be it through financial independence
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:25.420]   or be it through starting baby steps like saving more or learning more about your IRAs
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.580]   or 401k, then all the more for you.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.060]   Invest in your education basically.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.980]   Because who better to educate yourself than yourself?
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   Words of wisdom.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.980]   Ruby, thanks for coming on.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   Welcome to the United States.
