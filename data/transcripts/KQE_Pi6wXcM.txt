[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   Day one at the Pastors Conference is in the books
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.000]   at the Minneapolis Convention Center,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   and we prepare for day two, which is incredibly full.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.600]   Be sure to follow the schedule and the livestream
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.000]   at desiringgod.org/live for all of the Tuesday
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.880]   details and schedule.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   As you know, Pastor John, conferences are costly,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.840]   and you have spoken at scores of conferences
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.200]   over the years, and many that dwarf our Pastors Conference
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   when it comes to size and venue cost and musical experience
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.240]   and lighting and production, and frankly,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.080]   by the sheer budget.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.520]   A listener to the podcast, Sean, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.760]   Pastor John, I've attended three Passion Conferences
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.000]   as a student and have now volunteered
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.680]   at five other Passion Conferences.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.740]   God used Passion to turn my life right side up
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.760]   and to call me to the nations.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.900]   I was introduced to the ministry of Desiring God
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.520]   through Passion too.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.560]   It is obvious to me that God has used these conferences
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.960]   for great good.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.840]   I know Louis Giglio is a Christian hedonist,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.600]   and I think Passion has remained a Christ-centered movement.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.040]   However, having seen the conferences now behind the scenes
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.000]   as a volunteer, part of me has honestly been a little appalled
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.920]   at the sheer magnitude of expense, equipment,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.440]   and labor that goes into an event of this size.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.360]   Is there a biblical way to think about and support
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.160]   large conferences that do so much good,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.120]   but at the same time, at least on the surface,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.920]   look somewhat out of character with the simplicity
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.800]   of Jesus's wartime lifestyle?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.920]   What would you say to Sean?
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.600]   The first thing I would say is how thankful I am
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   when anyone is wrestling in America or in the West
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.240]   with the question of whether our Western prosperity
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.680]   in any of its forms is a good reflection
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   of the life of Jesus and what Jesus calls us to live.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.680]   Now, my own sense of this is that none of us
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.440]   has conformed every aspect of our lifestyle
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.400]   to the beauty of Christ and his radical orientation
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.320]   on God and heaven and people,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.120]   rather than self in this world and material possessions.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.000]   None of us has arrived at conforming our lives
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240]   to Jesus's way fully.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.200]   So I don't begin to claim that I occupy a position
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   at this moment on APJ that I could confidently hold up
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.320]   in every aspect as exemplary for everyone in America.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.040]   Compared to the vast populations of the developing world,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.840]   all of us in America, no matter how simple our lifestyle,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.320]   are wealthy.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.920]   When the New Testament addresses the rich,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.040]   we should think it is addressing us,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.840]   not just the millionaires on Wall Street.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.400]   In other words, it isn't just large conferences
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   or concerts or crusades that attract tens of thousands
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.000]   of people and may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.560]   It isn't just them that look out of character
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.600]   when compared to the first century Palestinian simplicity.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.120]   Everything looks out of character.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.180]   Everything in modern life looks out of character
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.960]   with Jesus' way of life.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   Simply to have a car looks wildly out of character.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.160]   To live in a house with central heating,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.620]   indoor plumbing, no outhouse,
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.480]   drinking water flowing out of every faucet in the house,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.160]   electricity lighting every room with wonderful light
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.520]   any time of day or night, refrigeration,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.040]   keeping all our food from spoiling for weeks,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.880]   communication devices to put us in touch with the police
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.500]   if we need police within five minutes or medical help.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200]   It's just incredible in my neighborhood.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.520]   I can just punch three numbers into my phone
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   and somebody will show up to save my life
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.920]   in three minutes from Henman County.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.360]   I've seen it done with hundreds of books
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.320]   on every shelf in my house,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.700]   computer software that lets me examine
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.520]   any part of the Bible or any book anywhere in the world
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.400]   within seconds.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   All of these are stunningly different, out of character.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.440]   It feels out of character.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.440]   With the lifestyle of a first century Palestinian peasant,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.080]   nothing is to be taken for granted.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.400]   I think sometimes we think of lifestyle
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.560]   in terms of denying ourselves a few things here and there,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.000]   failing to realize everything in our life
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.080]   is a mark of wealth and prosperity
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   and incredible advances scientifically and other ways.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.960]   So amen to Sean for asking the question.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   And my approach now to lifestyle issues of this sort
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.080]   is to try to take the main aim of scripture
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.240]   and pursue it by balancing two guidelines.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.080]   Here's what I mean.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.280]   The main aim of scripture is to magnify
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.760]   the supreme truth and beauty and worth of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.140]   That is the ultimate aim of all things,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.140]   to magnify the supreme truth and beauty and worth
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.200]   of God in Christ or Jesus Christ to the glory of the Father.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.760]   To live to show that Jesus is better than life
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.260]   is the goal of life.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.960]   To spend money in a way that shows Jesus better than money
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.480]   is the goal of money.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.860]   To buy or rent a house to show that Jesus is better
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.340]   than a house is the way you're supposed to buy a house.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.320]   To get an education to show that Jesus is better
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.640]   than education is the way to get an education
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.320]   and on and on and on.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.940]   So the ultimate aim of the Bible, of scripture, of history,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.720]   of life, of the universe, of God in all things
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.340]   is to magnify the supreme truth, beauty, and worth of Jesus.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.780]   Now, there are two guidelines with regard to lifestyle
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.660]   that guide me in pursuing that goal.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.660]   One, God gives us good gifts of creation to be enjoyed
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.940]   as expressions of his own all-satisfying nature,
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.060]   1 Timothy 6, 17.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.260]   As for the rich, that's us, as for the rich
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.900]   in this present age, charge them not to be haughty
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.560]   nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.560]   but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.960]   In other words, enjoy God's gifts in creation
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.680]   without experiencing them as more satisfying than God
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.800]   or separated from God.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.720]   Be thankful to God for them and taste God in them.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.120]   That's principle number one, guideline number one.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.620]   Number two is we are not yet in heaven.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.960]   We're not in paradise.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.400]   We're not yet beyond death.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.940]   We're not yet beyond sickness or sin or depression
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.400]   or hunger or genocide or injustice or poverty or crime
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   or addictions or divorce or ethnocentrism or hatred.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   And therefore, to think of maximizing earthly comforts
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.760]   and securities and pleasures now
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   is a fundamental misreading of the age we live in.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.420]   We are at war with the God of this world
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.600]   and the stakes are eternal and the weapons are spiritual
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   and how we live should reflect this wartime moment.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.940]   This wartime mindset.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.360]   So those are my two principles to keep in balance,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.120]   a world to enjoy as a gift of God
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.120]   and a world to save in the power of God.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.520]   So my way of sorting through lifestyle issues,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.680]   including very expensive conferences or mission trips
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.480]   or church buildings, is not to think merely
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.840]   in terms of simplicity,
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.480]   but in terms of wartime effectiveness.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   In wartime, you may not change the tires on your car
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.400]   because the front line needs the rubber for the Jeeps.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.160]   And in that sense, you are radically simple,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   but you may also build a $50 million B-52 bomber
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.880]   to deliver the knockout blow to the enemy
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.720]   that ends the war.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.400]   Jesus presses us toward a wartime lifestyle
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.680]   for the sake of others,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.200]   not merely for the sake of simplicity in itself.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.740]   Sell your possessions and give to the needy.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.800]   Provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   with a treasure in the heavens, Luke 12:33 or Luke 16:9.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.560]   Make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.440]   so that when it fails,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.320]   they will receive you into eternal dwellings,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   or Luke 12, 29.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.440]   Do not seek what you are to eat
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.120]   or what you are to drink or be worried,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.720]   for all the nations seek those things
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.520]   and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.800]   Instead, seek his kingdom
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.520]   and these things will be added to you.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   So the aim is always the great, eternal goodness.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.720]   Good and advance of the kingdom
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.040]   in people's hearts and in lives.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   A wartime lifestyle does not romanticize
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.240]   about simple living,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   as if the world in its lost condition
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.680]   benefited from my growing vegetables in the backyard
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.320]   or my having only two pairs of jeans
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.280]   that I wear every other day.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.500]   That does no good for the world at all necessarily.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.500]   A wartime lifestyle may spend a great deal of money
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.520]   to accomplish some great good for the world.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.400]   And in the process,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.520]   that expense may look like something Jesus never did.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.840]   In fact, he didn't, he didn't.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.460]   But that difference, I think, is incidental
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.160]   if the deeper commitments are the same,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.880]   God and heaven and people over self
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.480]   and this world and material possession.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.800]   So here's my counsel to all of us.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.520]   Whether you have a small influence
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.280]   over one other person in your life or huge influence,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   say a $100,000 salary or a $500,000 salary
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.480]   does not have to be accompanied
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   by a corresponding $100,000 or $500,000 lifestyle.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.200]   That's the American lie.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   God is calling us to be conduits of grace and resources,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.300]   not cul-de-sacs.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.760]   Our danger today is thinking
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.720]   that the conduit has to be gold-lined.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.240]   It shouldn't be.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.480]   Copper will do.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.360]   I wrote a chapter about that.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   Copper will do as we channel a $500,000 salary
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   into good for others while we live at a, what,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.440]   60, 40, 50, $1,000 lifestyle.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.680]   And here's the great reason.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.000]   Gratitude for luxury,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.980]   and I'm trying to respond to prosperity stuff here.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.980]   Gratitude for luxury impresses no one with our Savior.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.640]   Yes.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.040]   No matter how grateful we are,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.000]   lining our lives with gold will not make the world think
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.760]   that our God is great.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.220]   It will make the world think that our God is gold.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.560]   That is no honor to the supremacy of His worth, none.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.480]   But His supremacy,
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.920]   Him being infinitely more valuable than gold,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.220]   is why we live.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.120]   - That is spiritual gold, metaphorical gold.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.080]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.160]   and thank you for the blunt but humble question, Sean.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   Speaking of conferences,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.720]   we need to get back to the conference in town.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   For more information about this podcast

[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.200]   with John Piper.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.260]   Tomorrow we return to look at the nature of joy.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.800]   What is it and where can we find it?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
