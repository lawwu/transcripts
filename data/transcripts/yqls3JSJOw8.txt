[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   In our consideration of the biblical doctrines, we come this evening to a new section, new
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:21.200]   simply in the sense that we recognise certain divisions for the sake of convenience of thought,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   but obviously new in no other sense. Also, I would like to indicate at this point the
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   marvellous way in which each one of these doctrines leads to the next, quite inevitably.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   Truth is one, God's purpose is a whole. So that as you finish dealing with one doctrine,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   you are of necessity introducing the next. Now last Friday night, you remember, we were
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   considering together the teaching of the Bible concerning the spiritual gifts. And in doing
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   that, we saw that these various gifts were given to the church. We considered how God
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:13.200]   gives apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers with the necessary gifts. And various
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   other gifts we saw were given to those, to Christian people, special gifts, temporary
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   gifts to those early Christians, other gifts which are more permanent and given to all
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   Christians at all times. But in all these cases, we were observing that the gifts were
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   given, in a sense, to the church and to those who are members of the church. And in that
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   way, we come, I say, by this kind of inevitable logic and by the force of truth itself, to
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   a consideration of the biblical doctrine of the nature of the church, the doctrine of
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   the church. Now this doctrine is very often entirely omitted in books that deal with biblical
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   doctrines. I find it very difficult to discover why, but that is undoubtedly the case. And
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   yet it seems to me that this is something which is most regrettable. Because if we really
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   are concerned to deal with the doctrines that appear in the Bible itself, well then we must
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   of necessity deal with the doctrine of the church. Every single New Testament epistle
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   was written to a church, and their teaching is so much about the church. So it isn't
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   enough that we should consider the doctrines of the Bible that deal with our more personal
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   and individualistic needs and experiences. All this space would not be devoted to truths
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   concerning the church in the New Testament unless this were something that really is
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   vital and essential. So the mere character of the scripture itself compels us to deal
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   with this doctrine of the church. Then another reason for dealing with it, surely, is this.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Think of the great prominence that this doctrine of the church has had in the history of the
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   church herself. Take the history of this our own country without going any further. Standing
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   out in the history of the life of this nation and of the people of the British Isles, very
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   prominently is this whole question of the church and the nature of the church. The Protestant
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   Reformation is one of those great turning points which everybody knows something about.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   The things that happened in the 17th century, the Civil War and certain aspects of the Civil
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   War. Now, you can't even look at those things from the secular standpoint without seeing
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   that this doctrine of the church is rather important. Our fathers, going back to those
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   centuries, regarded this doctrine as of such vital importance that they were prepared to
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   undergo very great hardships and to suffer the loss of almost all things because of their
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   concern about this doctrine of the nature of the church. To them it was not something
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   that didn't matter very much that you could regard it as a matter of indifference. Whatever
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   persecution they might have to endure, even at the risk of their lives, many of them formed
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   their conventicles, as you know, and insisted upon meeting together. So that to them, obviously,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   the doctrine of the church was a very important doctrine. And I suggest to you that if we
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   had no other reason for considering it, therefore, our very respect for the names and for the
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   greatness of our distant forefathers should compel us to do it. Men don't suffer like
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   that for truth and for a cause if it is an indifferent matter. And then, of course, there
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   is another reason today which drives us to consider this question, and that is the great
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   prominence that is being given at the present time to this whole question of the Christian
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   church in connection with what goes by the name of the ecumenical movement. Now, the
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   religious newspapers really seem to be devoting themselves almost exclusively to this. I don't
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   know to what extent you follow these papers, but I don't care what denomination they belong
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   to, they're all full of it. It was for months this year up to Evanston, and now it's after
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   Evanston what? And the post-Evanston outlook and so on. Well, a few years ago it was all
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   about Amsterdam, and the whole emphasis, you see, is upon the church. It is being said
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   by the exponents of this particular ecumenical doctrine that the particular function of the
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   church in the 20th century is to call attention to the nature of the church. So, if we want
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   to be able to enter into discussion with such people, and to be able to take an intelligent
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   interest in these discussions, it behoves us to know something about the New Testament
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   doctrine of the church. Very well. You see, there are abundant reasons why we ought to
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   look at it together. But I want to go further. I have a reason which to me is far more important
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   than all those put together in a sense. And it's this. That I'm not at all sure, but that
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   it is our failure as evangelical people particularly, during the last 60 to 70 years, to take the
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   biblical teaching concerning the nature of the church seriously, that accounts for most
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   of the problems that we are confronting at the present time. I mean by that, that for
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   some reason or another, our immediate fathers and grandfathers felt that it was sufficient
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   to form movements, and didn't think in terms of the church. With the result that the evangelical
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   witness is diluted amongst the great denominations, and Christian people only meet together in
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   movements instead of in churches. I mean evangelical Christians. So that I think that from that
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   standpoint, this is a highly important subject. If we have a real deep concern about the evangelical
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   message and its vital importance in the world today, well then I say we are compelled to
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   consider the biblical teaching concerning the nature of the church. Very well. Let's
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   try to approach it like this. Let me also at this point make my usual introductory remark.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   It is a highly controversial subject. They've all been practically, haven't they? Almost
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   every doctrine we touch, I have to say that about it. Well, the history alone to which
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   I've been referring assures us that this is, of all of them perhaps, the most highly
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   controversial. And yet I say again, it's sheer cowardice to avoid dealing with a subject
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   simply because it's controversial. Our business is, whatever our upbringing, whatever our
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   background, whatever our prejudice is, to come and endeavor at any rate to consider
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   with as open a mind as we can what the scriptures really have to tell us. Let us all try to
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   do that, praying that God will deliver us from our prejudices, which we all tend to
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   suffer from. Now let us come therefore to certain preliminary words of definition. The
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   first thing it seems to me we've got to try to deal with is this. What is the relationship
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   of the Church to the Kingdom of God? You see, you get these two teachings in the scriptures,
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   the teaching about the Kingdom of God, then the teaching about the Church. And there is
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   often a great deal of confusion between the two. This is very largely the case, of course,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   because the Roman Catholic Church identifies them. In Roman Catholic teaching, the Church
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   is the Kingdom of God, and she's absolutely consistent in the way in which she works that
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   out. She claims therefore a right to rule and to dominate the whole of life in every
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   respect. And do you remember how in the Middle Ages the Roman Church used to rule kings and
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   lords and princes and countries and powers? She claimed that because she is the Kingdom
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   of God, and she was supreme. And that idea somehow has tended to persist. So we must
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   be clear about the relationship of the Church and the Kingdom. What is the Kingdom of God?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   Well, the Kingdom of God is best defined, surely, as this, as the rule of God. The Kingdom
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   of God is present wherever God is reigning and ruling. That is why our Lord was able
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   to say, you remember, when he was here in the flesh, that because of his activity and
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   his works, he said, "The Kingdom of God is amongst you and has come upon you." If I,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   he said, by the finger of God do these things, then the Kingdom of God has come amongst you
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   and upon you. He was ruling at that point. So that you see, if you regard the Kingdom
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   of God as the rule and the reign of God, you can say that it was here when our Lord was
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   here in person. It is present now wherever the Lord Jesus Christ is acknowledged as Lord.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   But it is to come with a greater fullness, when everybody and everything will have to
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   acknowledge his Lordship. So that in that sense you can say that the Kingdom has come,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   the Kingdom is coming, and the Kingdom is amongst us, and the Kingdom is yet to come.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   Well now then, what is the relationship of the Church to that? Well surely it is this.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   The Church is an expression of the Kingdom. It isn't the Kingdom. The Kingdom of God
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   is a wider and a bigger concept than the Church. In the Church, where the Church is truly the
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   Church, the Lordship of Christ is acknowledged and recognized and he reigns there. So the
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   Kingdom is there at that point. Well that is the Church. The Church is a part of the
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   Kingdom, but it is only a part of it. His Kingdom is much wider than that. He rules
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   in places where he is not acknowledged. Outside the Church even, because all things are in
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   his hand and history is in his hand. So the Church we must regard as an expression of
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   the Kingdom. But it is not to be equated with the Kingdom. It is not coextensive with the
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   Kingdom. Very well, let's leave that at that. It is a very great subject which we ought
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   really to go into in greater detail, but I am simply concerned with a number of definitions
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   this evening. Now then let us come to some of the terms that are used. The term, as you
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   are familiar with it, which is translated here at Church is the term Ecclesia. And the
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   Ecclesia means the called out. Ecclesia means those who are called out. Not of necessity
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   called out of the world, but it means people who are called out of society for some particular
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   function or purpose. They are called together, if you like. Or indeed you can translate it
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   by the word assembly. Now the word, you see, is not confined in the Scriptures to a spiritual
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   assembly. If you read the account of that extraordinary meeting that took place in the
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   city of Ephesus, you will find it in the 19th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. A great
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   meeting took place, it almost became a riot, and the town clerk referred to it as an assembly,
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   an ecclesia. All he meant by that was that a number of people had come together. And
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   that is the basic meaning of this term ecclesia. In the same way, if you read the address of
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   the martyr Stephen in the 7th chapter of Acts, you will find that in verse 38 he refers to
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   Moses being with the church that was in the wilderness. So the children of Israel in the
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   Old Testament were a church. They were the ecclesia. That is the church in the Old Testament.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   This gathering, this assembly of God's people, the term church is used with respect to that.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   So that is its basic and fundamental meaning. Now the word which, our word church, or the
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   word they use in Scotland, the kirk, and all the cognate similar terms and names, they
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   carry a slightly different meaning. The meaning there is that we belong to the Lord, the curious,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   the Lord, the Kaiser, the Caesar, the Lord. That is where our word church comes from.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   And it is important that we should remember that because you must put these two meanings
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   together. The church really consists of those people who belong to the Lord who are gathered
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   together. That is a kind of basic meaning to the terms which are used for church in
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   the New Testament scriptures. But let us go a step further. Let us go on to consider certain
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   statements which are made about the church or with respect to the church in the scriptures.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   And these are really important. You will find that the terms applied to the church are generally
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   used with regard to a local gathering. Now the distinction I am making at this point
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   is this. It is the difference between the church thought of as a general idea and the
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   church thought of as a local and particular idea. Now the term that is almost invariably
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   used, I will give you the exceptions in a moment, but the terms that are practically
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   always used in the scripture carry this local meaning. Now let me give you some illustrations
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   of that. Paul in the 16th chapter of the epistle to the Romans, in sending his greetings to
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   Aquila and Priscilla, makes a reference to the church that meets in their house. Now
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   there is a perfect example of it. A number of these Christians met together in the house
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   of Aquila and Priscilla and the apostle Paul does not hesitate to call that a church. You
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   see it is a local gathering. He is not thinking of the church in terms of this modern ecumenical
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   idea according to which the church is the great thing, not the local gatherings in the
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   scriptures. I am saying the meaning is almost invariably the local gathering, the church
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   that is in their house. And then you see he addresses his epistles to the church of God
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   which is in Corinth. He writes for instance in the Galatian epistle to the churches of
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   Galatia. He does not write to the church of Galatia. He writes to the churches of Galatia.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   Obviously he was not thinking of one unit which was divided into local numbers. He was
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   thinking of the local units. He does not talk about the church of Galatia which has a branch
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   here, there and there. No, no, he thinks of the churches, a number of these units in Galatia.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   The most significant point and the most important point. Now if you go through your scriptures
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   you will find I say that that is speaking very generally the universal apostolic way
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   of handling this subject. But we do have to notice that there are some two or three instances
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   where the word church is used rather than churches. Now one of them is rather interesting.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   It is to be found in the 9th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles and in the 31st verse.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   Now there is a difference here between the authorized and the revised version. Here in
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   my authorized I read this. "Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   and Samaria and were edified." The plural. But there in the revised version in front
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   of you, you have got it in the singular. The church. It is all in the singular. It is about
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.200]   the church and it is not where edified but being edified. Now that is an interesting
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   point. It has to be conceded that the revised version is undoubtedly the better translation.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   And it is a question again of which particular version you use, which ancient document you
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   regard as the most important. So we grant that it should read the church. Yes but even
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   then you see we have got to remember this. That the reference is almost certainly to
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   the members of the church at Jerusalem who had been scattered abroad as the result of
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   the persecution. So even there probably it is not referring to this idea of the church
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   as distinct from the churches but was thinking of the one church scattered abroad in various
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   places and was at peace. However it isn't as vital a point as all that. And again you
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   see in 1 Corinthians 12, 28 we read this. "And God hath set some in the church, first
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   apostles, secondarily prophets." He doesn't say he has set them in the churches. He says
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   he has set them in the church. So that in those instances we have the use of the church
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   in the singular, not in the plural. And then there is one other way in which the term is
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   used. In certain passages like those great passages in the epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   the church is obviously being thought of by the apostle as including not only those who
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   are on earth but also those who are in heaven. At the end of the first chapter he puts it
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   like this. "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   all things, to the church which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all."
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   And you'll find that he does it in the same way in the third chapter in the tenth verse
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   to the intent he says that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   by the church the manifold wisdom of God. And the same again in the fifth chapter. Now
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   then, so far we've seen this. That generally speaking, the term is used in the plural,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   the writers are obviously thinking of individual churches. But in these few instances which
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   I've just given to you, there is a larger and a bigger conception of the term "the
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   church" is used as distinct from the churches. Then the next thing I think to call attention
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   to is the various pictures or illustrations which are used in order to teach the doctrine
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   concerning the church. And there are quite a number and very interesting ones. The first
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   is the analogy of a body. The church is the body of Christ we are told. And you'll find
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   that in several of the New Testament epistles. The classical example of course is the first
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   epistle to the Corinthians, the twelfth chapter. The church as the body of Christ. You've
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   got it in the twelfth of Romans, you've got it in the fourth of Ephesians, and in many
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   other places. Then another idea is the church as a temple, or as a building. The apostle
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   compares himself to a wise master builder. He talks about the church being built on the
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   foundation of the apostles and prophets. So he thinks of it there as a building that is
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   being erected and going up. Then you will find that he sometimes refers to the church
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   as the bride of Christ. That's in the fifth of Ephesians for instance. And there are other
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   examples of that in the book of Revelation. And another conception is that of an empire.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   In the second chapter of Ephesians he talks about our being fellow citizens with the saints
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   and of the household of God. Obviously an analogy that came very readily to the mind
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   of the apostle. He was probably a prisoner in Rome at the time he wrote that epistle.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   And there he was thinking of this great Roman empire and he felt that there was something
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   analogous to that about the church. All these parts scattered abroad and yet there was a
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   sort of central unity. Well now then, take all these things together and what is our
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   conclusion? Well we can put it like this. Clearly the church is something spiritual
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   and invisible. That is the church as it were. Now that isn't something visible, that's
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   something invisible. All these instances I've given you of the church used in the singular
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   are suggesting something which has a reality as a spiritual entity but it can't be seen.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   But at the same time the church is also visible and can be seen externally and can be described
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   as existing in Corinth or in Rome or in some other particular place. Now it's very important
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   that we should bear those two things in our mind. That the church is invisible but yet
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   manifests itself visibly. This invisible something has local manifestation. Now a good analogy
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   here of course is the soul. You can't see a man's soul. But you know that a man has
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   got a soul and he expresses and manifests the fact that he's got a soul through his
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   body and through his behavior and his life. The invisible manifesting itself through the
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   visible. And that is obviously true of the Christian church. Apart from local churches
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:04.200]   there is such a thing as the church. The body of Christ is an entity. It's a will and
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   a living thing. And of course it's very important that we should be drawing these
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   distinctions. Because in the light of what I've been saying I can go on to say this.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   You cannot be a Christian without being a member of the church, spiritual and invisible.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:38.200]   It's impossible. All Christians are members of the body of Christ. I mean this invisible
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   spiritual church. But you can be a member of it without of necessity being a member
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   of a visible part of the church. You should be but you can be one without the other. On
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   the other hand it is possible to be a member of the visible external manifestation of the
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   church and not to be a member of the invisible spiritual church. So that you see these distinctions
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   are rather important. And they are both to be found in the scripture. The church which
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   is his body, the church at Corinth, the church at Rome, these visible local manifestations,
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   the churches of Galatia. Or if you like another term you can speak as has been done throughout
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   the centuries of the church militant and the church triumphant. The church on earth is
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   fighting for her life, for her doctrine, for everything. The church that is beyond the
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   veil is there rejoicing and triumphant. Take for instance the great way in which that is
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   put in the twelfth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. Well then I would sum all
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   this up by putting it like this. That the general picture in the New Testament of what
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   is meant by the church is a local gathering of saints where the presence and the lordship
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   of Christ is recognized. That's the usual meaning given in the scriptures to this term
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:23.200]   church. But let us always remember I say that over and above that, all in those local manifestations
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   of the church who are truly born again and spiritual people are also members of this
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   unseen spiritual church, this true body of Christ. Very well, there it seems to me is
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   something which is of very great importance if we are to understand the present discussion
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   about the church in particular. So I come on to that next question, the question of
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   the unity of the church. And this is the great topic of today. Now here surely there are
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   certain things which can be said without any fear of contradiction. If we are to be guided
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   by the scriptural teaching then we've got to agree at once that the unity that the scripture
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   is interested in in the church is spiritual unity. That was why I read that seventeenth
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   chapter of the gospel according to Saint John at the beginning. Oh how often is this chapter
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   misquoted today. People just tear a phrase right out of its context that there might
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   be one they say and leave it at that. And say that division in the church is the greatest
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   sin of all and so on. Well we of course all agree that division is regrettable, schism
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   is certainly sin. Yes but you see when that is interpreted as meaning that anybody who
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   calls himself a Christian in any shape or form is one with whom we should be in absolute
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   unity in every respect, it becomes an actual contradiction of what the seventeenth of John
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   teaches. What I mean is this. The seventeenth of John surely makes it quite plain and clear
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   as to the character of this unity. Our Lord's terms are these, as thou father art in me
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:30.200]   and I in thee that they also may be one in us. And the glory which thou gavest me I have
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   given them that they may be one even as we are one. That's all spiritual. It's the relationship
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   between the father and the son and those who are in Christ and in the father and the son.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   And he's already told us certain things about these people. He says I have given unto them
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   the words that thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   came out from thee and have believed that thou didst send me. So these words are only
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   applicable to men who believe that particular doctrine. And if a man tells me that he's
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   a Christian but says Jesus was only a man, I say I have no unity with him. I don't belong
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   to him. He may call himself a Christian but if he hasn't believed and accepted this, there
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   is no basis of unity. It's spiritual unity. Then Paul puts it, you remember, in the fourth
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   chapter of Ephesians in the third verse. He talks about the unity of the spirit in the
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   bond of peace. That great twelfth chapter of 1 Corinthians we were looking at last week,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   it makes the same point. If the analogy of the body is at all right, there must be an
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   essential organic spiritual unity. If the parts can't work harmoniously, if they don't
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   belong to one another, if they haven't got the same life in them, if the same blood isn't
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   flowing through them, then you see he says that through one spirit we have access by
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   one spirit unto the Father. So that the first thing to emphasize is the spirit. It's a
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   spiritual unity. It isn't an organization of unity. It isn't a mere amalgamation of
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   a number of organizations. It isn't a coalition of people who disagree and who differ for
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   the sake of some common purpose. That isn't what I find in the scriptures. But it's something
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   mystical, it's something spiritual, it's something vital, it's a community of life.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   It isn't a mere paper agreement or an organizational amalgamation. But the second thing is equally
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   clear in the scripture. And that is that the basis of unity must be doctrine. It must be
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   doctrinal. Now I've shown you that already in this seventeenth chapter of John. He says
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   "Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   given unto them the words which thou gavest me. And they have received them, and have
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me."
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   Now those words mean the words about his being the only begotten son of God. They are words
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   about the incarnation, about the word being made flesh. They are words in which he claims
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:37.200]   "Before Abraham was I am." They are words, in other words, that teach his miraculous
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   coming into the world, the virgin birth, they refer to his miracles because he refers them
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:49.200]   himself to his miracles, the supernatural, the purpose of his death, giving his life
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   a ransom for many, and so on. Those are the words that he spoke about the person of the
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   Holy Spirit, and so on. And yet you see we are asked today to enter into some great unity
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   with people who deny his deity, his unique deity, who don't believe that he's the only
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   begotten son of God, who don't believe the virgin birth, who don't believe he ever worked
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   a miracle. They say miracles are impossible, and that that's folklore. They don't believe
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   in the substitutionary atonement, they don't believe in the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   I say that to talk about unity with such people is a denial of the seventeenth chapter of
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   the gospel according to Saint John. They pick out this one statement about that they may
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   be one, and forget all this rich doctrinal teaching that has preceded it. But that's
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   not the only example of this. Do you remember what you read in Acts 2.42? In the very second
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   chapter of Acts, immediately after the day of Pentecost, we are told, "And they all
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, teaching, and fellowship, and breaking of
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   bread, and prayer." Scripture, my friends, is verbally inspired. Words count, and the
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   place and the position of words in a verse are of tremendous importance. You notice that
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   we are not told that they continued steadfastly in the apostles' fellowship, and doctrine,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   and breaking of bread, and prayer. No, the apostles' doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   of bread, and prayer. In other words, before you can have fellowship, there must be community
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   of doctrine. Fellowship is based upon the same faith, the same truth, the same understanding.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   If you mean one thing by Christ, and the other man means another, can you have real fellowship
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   with him? How can you both go through the same person to God if one thinks he's only
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   a man, and the other says, "No, no, he's the eternal substance made flesh"? There
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   must be community of belief. You're unhappy about the other man, and you're doubtful
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   as to what he means by his terms otherwise. The apostles' doctrine, then fellowship.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   But today, you see, fellowship is put first. They say, "Let's all get together. We
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   can then decide about these matters of belief." But you can't have fellowship apart from
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   this unity of doctrine. Indeed, there is even a stronger statement than this. The second
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   epistle of John, in the tenth verse, you read these words. Now, the second epistle of John,
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   remember, not the first epistle, second chapter, but the second epistle. "If there come
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   him Godspeed; for he that biddeth him Godspeed is partaker of his evil deeds." That's
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   John the apostle of love. He attaches that significance to doctrine and to truth. He
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   says, "You mustn't receive the man into your house. If you do, you're encouraging
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   him. If you give him a meal and send him on his journey, you're encouraging his false
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   doctrine. Don't do it," says John. And if you read the first epistle of John, you'll
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   find that all along he's concerned about the same thing. There were certain people,
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   he says, who've gone out from amongst us. These antichrists and their followers, they
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   were amongst us, but they've gone out. Evidently, there were not others, says John. And it's
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   on a point of doctrine, remember. No, no, doctrine is essential and vital to true fellowship.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   So that when you're discussing the question of the unity of the Church, you must always
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   put in the foremost position the spiritual character and the doctrinal character of the
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   unity. May I put it in a phrase like this? It's never a very difficult thing to get
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   a coalition of people who believe nothing in particular. But that, my dear friends,
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   is not unity. Unity is something positive. It isn't people coming together because
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   nobody cares very much what you say or what you believe. Unity is a life, it's a power,
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   it's an enthusiasm, it's people welded together because they hold this in common.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   And above everywhere else, that is true in the Church of God. I see my time is going
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   and I hadn't intended to dilate as I've done on some of these points, but after all,
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   how vital they are. And if you go back through the long history of the Church, you'll find
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   that the Church has always counted most and has been greatly used of God. When you've
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   had perhaps even a handful of people who were agreed in spirit and in doctrine, God could
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   take hold of them and use them and do mighty things through them. Whereas when you had
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   but one church in the whole of Western Europe, well, what did she lead to? The Dark Ages.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   And yet it seems to me that this great lesson of history is being entirely forgotten and
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   utterly ignored at this present time. I say these things not because I'm animated by
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   any controversial spirit, but because I have a zeal for the truth as I find it in the Scriptures
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   and regard it as tragic to note the way in which Scripture is being twisted and perverted
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   in the interests of a unity which is not a unity.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Let me say one last word this evening. What is the relationship of the Church to the State?
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   Here again you see a highly controversial subject. The Roman Catholic idea was that
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   the Church is the State and is everything else, that the Church controls everything.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   And as I reminded you at the beginning, the Church did that. At the extreme opposite to
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   that is the so-called Erastian view, a view first propounded by a man called Erastus,
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   whom I regret to say was a medical man. I feel I must on some occasion give you the
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   story and the history of the unfortunate interventions of medical men in the doctrinal history of
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   the Church. Erastus, unfortunately, was the man who started this pernicious doctrine and
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   idea that the Church is a branch of the State. Now that is, of course, the view in this country
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   with regard to the Church of England. The Church of England is Erastian and most of
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   the Lutheran churches take the same view. The Lutheran Church in Germany was Erastian
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   and I think a very good case can be made out for saying that perhaps we would never have
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   heard of the man called Hitler were it not for the Erastianism of the Lutheran Church
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   in Germany. However, that is a debatable point. Now there is the exact opposite of the Roman
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   Catholic view, that the Church is a kind of department of State and it is ruled and governed
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   by the State, so that the head of the State appoints bishops and various other dignitaries
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   and functionaries in the Church and rarely does control. You remember, for instance,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   in 1928, many of you, the great controversy in the House of Commons over the new proposed
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   prayer book. The Church had decided to have this, but the Parliament was able to turn
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   it down. You may say, "Well, a very good thing that the Parliament had that authority."
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   From one standpoint, yes, but from another standpoint, no, because that is a weapon which
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   can work both ways. In 1928 it happened to do the right thing, but what if the Parliament
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   suddenly decided to do the wrong thing? It still has the power to do it, let us never
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   forget. And so on. Well, now there you have got the Roman Catholic conception and the
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Erastia. As over against these, surely we must agree, if we go carefully through the
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   scriptures about these things, is this other idea which believes in what can be described
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   as the two estates. It is God who owns everything. God is the Lord of the universe, as well as
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   the Lord of the Church. God has ordained the state. The powers that be, says Paul, are
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   ordained of God. The magistrates and various other types of rulers, man has not made them,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   it is God who has ordained them. Yes, but there is this other estate, the Church. And
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   these two things exist side by side. The one does not control the other. They are both
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   separate, and they are both under God. I suggest to you that that is the picture that you find
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   in the New Testament. There is no indication at all here in the New Testament of anything
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   coming anywhere near a state church. No, no. These people were independent of governments.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   They met under the Lordship and in the presence of Christ. And outside was the great state
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   to which they belonged. They were still citizens of that state, but here they entered into
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   a realm which had nothing in a sense to do with the state at all. And that has been the
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   reformed view of the relationship between the state and the Church throughout the centuries.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   In exactly the same way one must point out that really you cannot find such a thing as
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   a national church in the Scriptures. Surely it is the opposite. There is no longer Jew
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   nor Gentile, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. Nations have nothing to do with
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   this. This is something different consisting of these people who have been born again and
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   have spiritual life and who are, as I say, members of this mystical body of Christ and
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   who gather together in their local assembly church, call it what you will, with Christ
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   as the head. Differences in nations and nationality and racial distinctions are immaterial and
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   should never be mentioned in connection with the Church at all. The Church is in that sense
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   one and her people are the same everywhere. And to add to these qualifications is surely
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   to be guilty of something that is not scriptural. We know historically how these things have
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   come to pass in various countries. There have been various historical accidents that have
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   led to certain consequences. But if we are concerned about the scriptural view, well
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   then I say that I at Enneret for one cannot find anything corresponding to such a condition
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:17.200]   anywhere referred to in the pages of the Scripture. It is no argument to say that the nation of
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   Israel was the Church in the Old Testament. That was so. That was so at that time. But
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   now the kingdom, as Christ said to them, has been taken from you and shall be given to
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   a nation bearing forth the fruits thereof. What is that? That is the Church, as Peter
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   proves in his first epistle and in the second chapter, where he applies to the Church the
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   words that were spoken to the nation of Israel. The Church is now supranational. She has her
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   people in all nations. She is above the nations. She consists of God's people living on earth
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   in states. But there they are citizens of that kingdom which is not of this world.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   Very well, I hope to finish this doctrine of the Church this evening. I see that I haven't.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   God willing, we will try to deal with the remainder next Friday evening. Let us pray.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   O Lord, our God, we would again thank Thee for all the perfection of Thy ways with respect
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   to us. Forgive us, O God, that we are guilty often of choosing only certain parts and aspects
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   of the teaching of Thy Word and ignoring others. O forgive us for our indolence, our laziness,
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   and indeed forgive us, O God, oftentimes that we are gripped by the spirit of fear and are
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   fearful of consequences and avoid difficulties. O God, grant us honesty, give us a hunger
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   and a thirst for truth, and give us a holy boldness. And above all, we pray Thee, give
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   us that humility whereby we shall humble ourselves and submit ourselves to be led of Thy Spirit.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   Hear us then, O God, and enlarge our understanding. And grant that in all things we may live to
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   the glory of Thy name and manifest Thy glory in the Church and through the Church, that
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   those who are without seeing us may be attracted unto Thee. And now may the grace of the Lord
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   with us now this night and evermore. Amen.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
