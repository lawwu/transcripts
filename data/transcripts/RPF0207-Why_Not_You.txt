[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.040]   First question is one of the major questions of the world. Why?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.840]   Why should you try? Why read that many books? Why go that far?
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.000]   Why earn that much? Why share that much? Why learn all that? Why get up that early?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.640]   Why put yourself through that much? Why try for all that? Good question. Why?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.120]   One of the best answers to why is the second question. Why not?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.000]   What else are you going to do with your life? Why not see how many books you can read?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.960]   How far you can go? How much you can earn? How many friends you can make?
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.800]   How much personality you can develop? Influence you can have?
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.480]   How many things you can accomplish? How far you can go and what you can see? Why not?
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.520]   You got to stay here till you go. Why not?
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.080]   The third question is why not you?
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.080]   Why not you? Some people have done the most incredible things with limited start.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   Why not you? Some people have done so well. They get to go, they get to see it all,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.440]   they get to do it. They get to be there. They get to have it. They get to enjoy it. Why not you?
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   Why not you watching the morning mist rise over the mountains of Scotland?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.800]   Exploring the mysteries of Spain, soaking up history in London.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.160]   Why not you? You got to take a stroll through the palace of Versailles.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   Why not you? You got to have lunch in one of those neat little sidewalk cafes in Paris.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.880]   I mean, Denny's is okay, but you got to try Paris.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.000]   Someday you got to gaze directly at the Mona Lisa.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.680]   I can show you where to find the most exquisite seashells in Miami
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.560]   and the Bahamas. I know where they are. Why not you? You got to shop on Fifth Avenue
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.840]   in New York. You got to stay at the Waldorf Astoria.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.400]   Have dinner at Lu Chow's, sliced roast goose on a bed of apple stew.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   Why not you? You got to drink in an Arizona sunset.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.920]   You got to see the world. You got to read the books. You've got to do the enterprises. You've
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.520]   got to be involved in commerce and love and travel and experiences. You got to do it all. Why not you?
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   You got to know the results that come from splendid discipline. There's nothing like a view from the top.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:14.160]   And the last question is, why not now? Don't postpone your better future any longer.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:23.840]   Get at it tomorrow with new vigor. Start to make changes, have conversations, make contact,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.520]   and do it now. And if you will, I have a feeling one of these days we'll be hearing your story.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   [Music]
