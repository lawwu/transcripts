[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.040]   Asset Protection Planning for Mere Mortals.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.880]   This episode is part three, in which we will discuss
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.020]   what is the problem that we are protecting against.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.280]   By way of refresher, this series falls in
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.320]   under the rubric of avoiding catastrophe.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.460]   Once you have done the hard work of earning money,
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.860]   once you've done the hard work of saving money
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.260]   and investing that money, you will become wealthy.
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.840]   And now you have a whole new set of problems
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.840]   called how do I protect this wealth
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.780]   from the people who would love to take advantage of it?
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.340]   Now that protection will take many forms.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.980]   In part one of this series, episode 601,
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.380]   I encouraged you to think very broadly
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.580]   about the topic of asset protection planning.
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.180]   I asked you to ask two questions.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.320]   What is an asset?
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.180]   And then from whom or from what risk
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.660]   are you interested in protecting the asset?
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.500]   And that risk will vary depending on your situation.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.360]   For some people, the risk is civil litigation,
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.400]   which is the bulk of what we'll be talking about today.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.040]   For some people, the risk is your deadbeat nephew
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.540]   coming and asking you for money
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.080]   that they're gonna go and squander.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.480]   For some people, the risk is physical theft,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.120]   the fact that your roommate may go through
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.780]   your private effects and pilfer your money
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.820]   if you have it saved there.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.820]   So of course, when I use that very broad discussion
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.660]   of asset protection, that you could identify the risks
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.700]   that would be appropriate to you.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.220]   In part two of the series, episode 602,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.400]   we talked about the legality and morality
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   of asset protection.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.060]   I asked two questions.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.240]   Is it legal to engage in asset protection planning?
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.140]   And I briefly defended the answer, yes,
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.740]   it is legal to engage in asset protection planning.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.440]   And as this series goes on, you'll hear more and more
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.380]   of the legal strategies and you'll see,
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.820]   and I trust be entirely persuaded
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.240]   that it's absolutely legal for you to engage
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.660]   in asset protection planning.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.060]   Part two of that question where I discussed,
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.460]   is it moral for you to engage in asset protection planning?
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.420]   That's one that is of course more subjective
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.100]   and we won't be talking about it much in this series,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.200]   but I defended the answer, yes, it is moral
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.140]   because you have no duty to make it easy
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.040]   for people to steal from you.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.080]   And it's your job, you can always choose
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.640]   to give your money away if you want to,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.980]   if you are found wrong or if you've committed wrong,
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.520]   it's always your choice to give the money away.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.920]   Even if you weren't wrong, you can always choose
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.160]   to give the things that are yours away.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.820]   But it's not right for you to make it easy
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.620]   for people to steal from you.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.100]   And there may be cases where you can be found legally
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.360]   in the wrong, where you know that you are morally
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   in the right.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.460]   And in those cases, I believe you have a moral duty,
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.460]   a moral obligation to fight against the moral injustice,
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.640]   no matter what the legal consequences are.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.080]   So I defended the thesis that yes,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840]   it is moral for you to engage in asset protection planning
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.640]   because you will always be in the situation
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.180]   where you can choose whether to give money.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.180]   You can choose whether to pay a claim.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.720]   And I want to put you in a situation where you're strong
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.760]   so that you can do what's morally right,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.520]   no matter the course.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.720]   Today in this episode, part three,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.020]   we're going to talk about what is the problem
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.660]   we are protecting against.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.760]   And my focus is to try to instill a little bit
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.960]   of concern into you.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.640]   I hesitate to use the word because I don't like
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.380]   selling fear, but I think I'm going to use it.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.840]   I want to instill a little bit of fear into you
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.140]   to inspire you to do some proactive planning
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.440]   by talking about what the problem is
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.840]   that we're actually protecting against.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.160]   Because if you don't understand the problem,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.560]   you may not understand how severe the problem actually is.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.360]   You might think, well, I understand
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.700]   why some high-flying heart surgeon,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.400]   who everyone knows has lots of money
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.240]   because after all, they're a heart surgeon,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480]   I understand why they would engage
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.080]   in asset protection planning.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.920]   And I understand why that fraudster businessman
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.180]   would engage in asset protection, but come on,
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.120]   I just have a few hundred thousand dollars saved,
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.480]   a little bit of money in my IRA,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.780]   working towards financial independence,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.180]   got a rental house, I don't have any big risks.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.460]   And I want to disabuse you of that lackadaisical attitude
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.320]   in this show by talking about the problem.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.300]   I'm going to read you a number of examples
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.660]   from various asset protection books
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.640]   to help you to understand how severe this is.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.040]   Quick comment on asset protection planning.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.940]   The entirety of this series is put together by me
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.380]   based upon research, not based upon practice.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.820]   I've never engaged in asset protection planning.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.680]   I'm not a lawyer, I don't write trusts,
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.080]   it's not what I do.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.960]   This is simply an interest of mine,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.460]   and I believe it should be an interest of other people.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.500]   And as such, I've educated myself about it,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.120]   but I've educated myself about it entirely through reading,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.400]   never through actual practice.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   Now, reading can be very helpful.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.460]   It's helpful because it gives you a broad survey.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.360]   And if you read a lot of stuff, as I do,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.240]   you find a lot of really bad books
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.400]   and a lot of really good books,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.940]   and you kind of learn to pick and choose.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.640]   And in many ways, when you read extensively about a subject,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.440]   you can start to see the themes that are the same
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.680]   that everyone agrees on,
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.540]   and then those themes that are more questionable.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.140]   In this series, I'm not going to be engaging
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.520]   in anything that's questionable.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.960]   I'm focusing on the things that everyone agrees on.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.420]   But I will refer you, you always need to go
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.460]   and work with a competent legal advisor,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.460]   financial advisor, most probably attorney
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.560]   specializing in asset protection planning.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.800]   There are many things you can do yourself,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   but you will always need to go
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.900]   and get specific legal counsel,
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.800]   because the variety of things that can affect your situation
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.500]   are so extreme that there's no possibility
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.380]   that I can teach you effectively through all those things.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.020]   You need an expert in this area for many of these things.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.540]   But in that extensive reading,
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.880]   I've come to see that there are usually
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.960]   about five or six ideas that everybody seems to agree on
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.360]   as far as why do we face this problem.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.760]   And I want to go through those with you.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.360]   The first problem is that we live,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.520]   in the United States of America in 2018,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   we live in a victim-oriented society.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.500]   We live in a victim-oriented society.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.640]   Now, there are two ways that you could take that.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.880]   For example, we could take that idea of victim orientation
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.300]   in the direction of you're saying,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.720]   we live in a society that is sensitive towards victims,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.540]   that wants to see victims protected.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.420]   I think there's probably a sense in which that's true.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.720]   And I'm proud to live in a society like that.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.920]   I want to always be one to stand against injustice.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.460]   I want to always be one to stand up for what is right
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.200]   and to defend the victims, to defend the helpless,
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.700]   to defend the innocent, to defend especially those
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.160]   who can't defend themselves.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.440]   I want to stand with the victim.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.600]   So I appreciate how in many ways we do that,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   perhaps in the United States,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.840]   perhaps better than in the past.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.080]   But there's another sense, and this is the sense
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.040]   in which that term is being used,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.680]   in which being in a victim-oriented society is not good.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.880]   And it's a sense that in our current society,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.660]   many people see themselves as victims who are helpless.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.720]   And they in fact want to be victims
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.200]   because by nature of being a victim,
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.960]   they gain other forms of credibility.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.140]   Now, the most important expression of this in our context
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.260]   is being the victim of something
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.940]   over which you can sue and get money.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.060]   And we see that enhanced constantly.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.000]   We see that discussed constantly.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.440]   Perhaps the most annoying examples of this,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.620]   and you understand why an attorney would engage
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.880]   in this form of advertising.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.740]   But what I find very difficult to deal with
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.740]   is how crassly many plaintiffs' attorneys
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.460]   advertise themselves to potential victims
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.420]   and how transparent they are
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.780]   about the financial motivation.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.980]   Where I live in Florida,
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.420]   there's a series of billboards put out by a local law firm.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.500]   And the billboards feature in very large letters,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.440]   well, they feature a picture of a person,
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.860]   just a normal snapshot, not a model, a real person.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.220]   And then in very large letters,
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.860]   they feature something like this.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.460]   Got me $632,000.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.820]   Or got me $1,322,000.
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.420]   Or got me $175,000.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.300]   And the entire point is to appeal to that larceny
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.140]   in the heart of many people,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.340]   I'm gonna get mine.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.840]   Gonna get me some.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.580]   I find that pretty offensive.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.920]   And you understand why the law firm uses that
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.560]   because then they get lots of phone calls
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.440]   from many people who were victims
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.360]   or who believe themselves to be victims,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.800]   and they can sort through that.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.160]   But this victim-oriented society
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   has created greater dangers.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.040]   And it seems like many people don't wish
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.420]   to take personal responsibility
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.880]   for things they can take personal responsibility for.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.160]   We joke about somebody having a slip and fall
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.380]   on your front sidewalk.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.800]   It's only funny because it's true.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.200]   Now, thankfully, most people
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.480]   who are walking up your sidewalk
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.400]   and slip and fall and hurt themselves,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.760]   thankfully, most people would say,
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.080]   I should have been more careful.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.200]   But there are a lot of people
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.900]   and a lot more people today who will say,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.280]   the sidewalk owner should have been more careful.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.200]   And they'll look for a lawsuit.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.440]   Now, I don't fully know what the source
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.500]   of this victim-oriented society is.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.880]   I don't know.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   But it seems as though the historic US-American ethos
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.840]   of we can do it, pull yourself up, work hard, you can do it,
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.680]   is largely less strong than it once was.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.120]   And there's much more of an ethos of you're a victim.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.080]   You've been victimized.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.900]   You're the 99%.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.200]   You've been victimized by the 1%.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.240]   Perhaps it's related to social theory,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.960]   the most common social theory
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.640]   that has been taught to US-American college students
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.040]   for many decades is postmodernism
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.960]   and the modern expression
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.120]   of that postmodern intersectionality,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.920]   where the more points of victimhood you can have,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.800]   the more sympathy you'll get.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.200]   You see this oftentimes in modern news stories.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.800]   At this point, I never trust a single news story
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.920]   from the United States
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.800]   related to racial disparagement, something like that.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.860]   Someone says somebody called me a racial name
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.320]   or somebody made some claim against me.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.680]   It seems like when you start shutting this out,
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.120]   I don't know what the percentage of it,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.480]   it seems about perhaps 70% of them or 80,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.040]   probably it's probably a Pareto principle,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   probably 80% of them, more and more seem to be faked.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.480]   And that is harmful to the 20% that are real,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.760]   but the 80% fake it so that they can acquire the status
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.160]   of being a victim and so that people will dote on them.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.320]   I don't know what it is.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.200]   You form your own theory,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.120]   but by living in a victim-oriented society
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   where there are many people who see themselves as victims,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.840]   that creates good fodder for number two,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.060]   which is plaintiff lawyers.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.760]   Most books refer to this as a litigation explosion,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   the time that we live in being a litigation explosion.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.200]   Now, why is this?
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.160]   Who knows what the source of the problem is?
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.220]   It could be some of the things that you often see cited.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.060]   There's a breakdown of traditional values,
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.980]   and by that you mean traditional Christian values,
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.520]   traditional Western Christian values.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.560]   As the hold of Christianity on Western society
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.440]   has slackened and in many cases completely disappeared,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.540]   the concept of personal responsibility
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.840]   and the concept of seeking forgiveness
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.500]   even in the face of injustice has largely diminished
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   in favor of much more of a get-what's-mine perspective.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.320]   Christians face serious problems
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.400]   when it comes to the topic of suing one another.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.500]   There are strong biblical warnings against engaging
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.440]   in lawsuits against one another,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.160]   and this creates this slowness, historically,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.720]   for people to sue one another.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.280]   Now, that seems to have changed,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.520]   especially as Christianity has lost its hold
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.920]   on Western society.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.600]   A major influence, perhaps,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.160]   could be the loss of a sense of community.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.700]   There was a reality in much of US American history
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.500]   where people lived in a local community.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.860]   That local community was very much human-sized,
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.500]   anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people,
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.580]   which meant that in that local community,
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.500]   you knew people and you had a reputation,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.460]   and that local reputation mattered.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.980]   If you were somebody who brought a lawsuit against somebody
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.260]   and that lawsuit were frivolous,
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.640]   that would harm your reputation
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.300]   and make it very hard to live in a local community.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.420]   There are many, many communities around the country
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.980]   that it still works that way.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.440]   But as we increasingly live in an urban society,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.460]   as we increasingly live in a society filled with many people,
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.700]   then it's much harder for that local reputation
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.580]   to be found out.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.840]   Your reputation now is not in terms of your city,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.780]   it's more in terms of your profession.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.520]   And as that local sense of coherence changes
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.340]   and falls apart,
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.360]   especially as most of us more identify
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.660]   with our political party
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.740]   or with our friends on Facebook, et cetera,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.620]   that local sense of community diminishes,
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.860]   and that leads to less of a prohibition
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.820]   or slowness about suing one another, perhaps that.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.440]   There's just a lot of lawyers.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.960]   One of the biggest challenges facing the country right now
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.040]   is the sheer number of attorneys.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.360]   And there are a couple of expressions
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.720]   as far as why this matters so much.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.700]   As tens of thousands of new lawyers
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.280]   graduate from law school every year,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.560]   they have to find something to do.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.240]   They have to find some way of earning a living.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   And of course, there are many specialties in law,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.200]   but perhaps the biggest headlines often come
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.320]   around attorneys who can win big judgments.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.740]   And there's a huge financial incentive
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.280]   for an attorney to take on cases
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   that result in them possibly receiving a large judgment.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.080]   I had several clients who were primarily
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.600]   plaintiff's attorneys where they did this,
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.520]   and they made a lot of money.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.080]   And it was very much high-flying work.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.240]   We have lots of lawyers coming out
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.600]   and then trying to figure out how do I make a living?
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.920]   Well, as those lawyers go out through society,
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.200]   they have to find more and more cases.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.880]   But all the good cases,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.960]   the cases where there are clear forms of right and wrong,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.760]   clear forms of negligence,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.320]   those plaintiffs can take that
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.160]   to any law firm in the country.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.480]   And so they usually, those cases go to a small number
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.200]   of well-established and famous lawyers.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.960]   And especially if you're up against somebody
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.000]   who's done serious wrong, et cetera,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.040]   because the plaintiff is not paying the bill, usually,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.440]   the attorney is taking it on a contingency fee basis.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.040]   The plaintiff just simply has to bring the case
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.840]   and they can pick and choose their lawyer.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.280]   Well, what about the bottom 80% of lawyers
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.880]   who are looking for work,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.240]   but they can't attract the good cases?
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.920]   Well, they have to go out and find more and more cases.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.360]   They have to go out and try more and more cases.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.840]   All the easy cases are gone,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.080]   and they go to the top few percent of law firms.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.640]   So now you have local attorneys trying to figure out
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.160]   how do I come up with something else?
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.560]   And they have to figure out how to make a living.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.280]   And so you have just this huge proliferation
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.240]   of plaintiff's attorneys.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.960]   And all of them are hungry for a lawsuit.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   They're all putting up attorneys.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.160]   They're sorry, they're all putting up billboards.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.400]   Got me $240,000, now come and get you some.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   And when you look at the incentives of the case,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.640]   and the actual incentives that the attorney faces,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.320]   the plaintiff can bring the case.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.640]   So the attorney advertises,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.360]   they talk to lots of plaintiffs,
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.160]   and the attorney has a choice.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.360]   Do I think there's a good case here
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.520]   and do I want to take it?
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.160]   If they take it on, the attorney bears
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   all of the financial risk of the case,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.640]   the plaintiff doesn't bear that usually.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.240]   And if it's a bad case, then the plaintiff does,
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.480]   the plaintiff bears it on an hourly fee basis.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.040]   But the attorney bears the risk.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.360]   And when the attorney follows through on the case,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.440]   they're hoping for many potential outcomes.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.480]   They're hoping to settle the case
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.920]   before it actually goes to trial.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.520]   And they know the power that an attorney,
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.000]   a good attorney has with a legal right
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.640]   of exposing somebody, they know the power
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.320]   that they have up against a normal person.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.400]   It's absolutely profound.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.360]   And so when you have these major,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.280]   just massive proliferation of plaintiff's attorneys,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.200]   and as a moment, massive new expanding theories
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.760]   of liability, which is the next one,
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.160]   you have a lot more potential for many civil cases.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   Again, the next one is expanding theories of liability.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.200]   As US American law has developed in the past,
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.880]   over the past decades, the traditional and normal ideas
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.240]   about who is liable for behavior
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.360]   have been superseded by expanded theories
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.080]   about who is liable for behavior
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.280]   and under what circumstances.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.440]   And it's very much driven as you have more
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.280]   and more attorneys who are taking these cases
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.120]   and looking to try to figure out
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.520]   how can we find some negligence somewhere
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.080]   by somebody who has money.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.320]   That's led to these ongoing theories.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   And the challenges, in my reading of this industry,
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.680]   it's currently unknown even where some of these limits
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.040]   of liability stop.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.320]   The next most important one you have to think about
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.640]   is the idea of deep pocket theory.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.480]   Who has a deep pocket?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.760]   And these two go together.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.320]   I'm gonna read you some examples here
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.400]   from a few different asset protection books
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.560]   that will give you an understanding
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.520]   of how these two play together.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   If you have somebody who has deep pockets,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.280]   and if you can find some theory of liability
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.640]   to apply to them, then you can have a successful lawsuit,
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.320]   which can make you, if you are a plaintiff's attorney,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.360]   or you, if you are a victim, quite a bit of money.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.160]   And the deep pocket theory has to do with
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.640]   who has the money to pay?
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.040]   If you don't have the money to pay,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.320]   no attorney is going to take their time
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.600]   to try the case.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.080]   Why would they spend months and months
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.360]   and tens of thousands of dollars,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.480]   if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to take a case
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.120]   where they'll get a legal judgment that they can't enforce?
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.440]   Let me read you a section here from an estate plan,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.800]   sorry, an asset protection planning book
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.840]   from a chapter called
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.760]   "Searching for the Deep Pocket Defendant."
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.000]   Before I do, I need to give you
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.360]   two minutes of warning on stories.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   I'm gonna read you a few stories,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.440]   but I would caution you to always be careful
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.280]   in accepting at face value any particular legal story
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.960]   without actually going and reading the legal case yourself.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.440]   Here's the problem.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.240]   With legal news articles and legal stories,
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.880]   there are a lot of them that are reported sensationally,
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.640]   that are truly sensational.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.760]   They are truly astounding when you actually look at it.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.760]   The problem has to do with
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.360]   when is the reporting being done
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.760]   and how accurate is the actual reporting?
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.600]   I'm so grateful when I was in college
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.760]   that I had a business law professor
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.560]   that forced us to start reading some cases.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.680]   And one of the cases we read was the case,
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.960]   the famous McDonald's hot coffee case,
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.000]   where a lady spilled hot coffee in her lap
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.600]   and sued McDonald's for selling hot coffee.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.680]   I don't know of a case that's more cited as ridiculous
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.320]   than that particular case.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.880]   But in actually reading the details of the case,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.720]   I came to believe that the lady was right in her lawsuit
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.480]   and justice was basically done.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.840]   The problem has to do with
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.320]   what historical perspective do you have?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.520]   So the facts of the case, been years since I've read it,
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.560]   you go and read it yourself,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.680]   but I'm pretty sure I've got the facts good enough
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.400]   that I can relate them to you with accuracy
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.760]   here in this short story.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.000]   This elderly lady did have hot coffee and she spilled it.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   She spilled it in her lap and suffered serious burns
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.560]   to her genitals, to her inner thighs, et cetera.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.960]   After the burn, she found out that McDonald's
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.800]   had at that time a practice of serving their coffee
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.600]   at a much, much higher temperature
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.480]   than most of us drink coffee or ever have coffee.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.360]   It was much closer to boiling
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.320]   because they wanted to make sure
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.920]   they were always serving hot coffee
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.200]   than we're accustomed to.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.240]   And they didn't have any extra labels
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.360]   as to far as how hot that was.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.520]   Now, you know as well as I do
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.600]   that if you have a cup of coffee
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.800]   from your home coffee maker, not a big risk.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.840]   If you spill it on yourself,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.360]   you might get a little bit of a scald,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.080]   but it's not gonna be serious burns.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.560]   But if you had a pot of just under boiling water
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.000]   on the stove and you spill it on yourself,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.080]   you know there's a bigger risk
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.960]   and you would be more careful with that.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.040]   That was the basics of her case.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.000]   And I believe she just simply wanted McDonald's
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.880]   to pay for some of her hospital bills.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.120]   Well, McDonald's fought,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.440]   and because McDonald's fought
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.680]   and pursued a very elite, aggressive, corporate,
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.800]   you know, this is a ridiculous lawsuit perspective,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.000]   then she sued all the way.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.440]   The jury was so offended by the behavior
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.480]   of the McDonald's defense attorneys
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.040]   that the jury awarded the lady
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.400]   many millions of dollars for her injuries.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.160]   And that was the headline that got reported.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.920]   Much later, those damages were adjusted
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.120]   down to a much more reasonable number,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.880]   but that never got reported.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.280]   So what happens a lot of times in these cases is,
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.560]   first of all, what are the actual facts of the case?
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.520]   You need to read the facts and understand the facts
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.360]   to understand was there actual liability here?
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.880]   Was there actual circumstances?
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.160]   And people will be very selective
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.720]   in reporting the facts when talking about legal cases.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.600]   The second thing is, what actually happens in the lawsuit?
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.960]   Were the awards and the damages
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.520]   that were actually assessed reasonable?
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.600]   And oftentimes, the jury may suggest a much higher reward
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   that the judge later adjusts.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.240]   So I'm square in the middle on this stuff.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.720]   I have lost much confidence
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.360]   in the modern US American legal system,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.080]   but I still see enough people who are working hard
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   to find justice that I still have more confidence
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.920]   in a lot of people.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.960]   And I would caution you,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.800]   many times cases are reported in absurd ways
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.720]   that when you go and read the actual case,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.440]   the facts don't bear out that stilted description of it.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.400]   Now, with that as the case,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.040]   let me read to you a few pages from this particular book
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.080]   by an estate planning attorney in a chapter called
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.560]   "Searching for the Deep Pocket Defendant."
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.400]   He writes this, "The reality of our legal system
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.680]   is that people are named as defendants in lawsuits,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.560]   not because of their degree of fault,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   but because of their ability to pay.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.520]   When an attorney is approached by a potential client
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.000]   who is claiming injury or economic loss,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.120]   the attorney will consider whether a theory of liability
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.880]   can be developed against a party who can pay a judgment.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.360]   This is called the search for the deep pocket defendant.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   The deep pocket defendant
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.240]   will have substantial insurance coverage
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.440]   or significant personal assets.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.800]   The measure of an attorney's skill
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.440]   is his ability to create a theory of liability,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.360]   which will connect a deep pocket defendant
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.320]   to the facts of a particular case.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   Here is an example of what might happen in a particular case.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.080]   Mr. Wilson is driving in his car.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.600]   Mr. Fineman runs through a stop sign at an intersection,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.160]   smashing into Wilson's car and causing Wilson severe injury.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.120]   From his hospital bed, Wilson Googles local attorneys
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.000]   and calls the first attorney he sees, Alan Abel.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.600]   He is what is known as a contingent fee lawyer.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.640]   He works for a percentage of the ultimate recovery
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.600]   and determines whether to invest his time and money in a case
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.160]   based upon what his expected return will be.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.520]   Since the time and expense of preparing for litigation
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.920]   can be considerable,
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.760]   an attorney cannot afford to take a case
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.480]   that is not likely to pay off.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.440]   Remember, no recovery, no fee.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.280]   Usually, the attorney advances all costs and expenses,
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   and in exchange, he recovers these costs,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.880]   plus 30% to 40% of any amounts
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.920]   that he can get from the defendant.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.240]   Before Abel decides to take Wilson's case,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.960]   he will want to do some serious research
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.800]   to determine the merits of the case.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.240]   Not the legal merits, the financial ones.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.160]   He will want to know whether Fineman has substantial assets
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.320]   in order to make the case worthwhile.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.720]   Abel runs a financial search
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.000]   and determines that Fineman has no insurance
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.480]   and no significant assets,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   such as a home or a retirement nest egg.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.240]   What happens? Is that the end of the case?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.120]   As for Fineman, it probably is the end of the case.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.600]   Abel is not going to waste his time
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.520]   suing someone who can't pay.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.960]   But Abel is not going to give up so easily.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.440]   He has a client with substantial injuries,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.400]   and that means a large damage award, big bucks.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.080]   But first, he has to find someone who can pay.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.280]   Here is how a successful lawyer would analyze the case
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.160]   to try to draw in a deep-pocket defendant.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.960]   Was Fineman on an errand for his employer
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.200]   at the time of the crash?
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.320]   If so, the employer can be sued.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.840]   Did Fineman have any alcohol in his system?
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.760]   The restaurant that served him may have liability.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.680]   Was Fineman on any medication?
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.800]   The pharmacist, drug company, or physician
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.600]   may have potential liability
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.080]   for failure to provide warnings,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.120]   or for writing or filling the prescription improperly.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.640]   The stop sign Fineman ran through
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.880]   was in a residential neighborhood
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.280]   in front of someone's house.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.520]   Did the homeowner properly maintain his property
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.640]   and clear his foliage
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.200]   to provide an unobstructed view of the stop sign?
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.240]   If not, there is a case against the homeowner for negligence.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.760]   Did the municipality take due care
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.440]   in the placement of the stop sign?
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.680]   Should it have used a traffic light instead?
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.720]   There may be a case against the city or county.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.500]   The driver's side door of Wilson's car collapsed on impact.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.680]   There is a possible case against the manufacturer
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.440]   for not making a more crash-resistant frame.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.240]   Do you see how far we are moving away from Fineman,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.200]   the person responsible for the accident,
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.360]   in an effort to tie in a remote deep pocket defendant?
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.880]   In any rational legal system,
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.920]   Fineman would be regarded as the wrongdoer.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.980]   He disobeyed the traffic law and he caused the injury.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.200]   Instead, we have an attorney trying to force the blame
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.220]   onto someone else who wasn't at the scene
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.520]   and doesn't even know the people involved.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.720]   The example that we just gave you
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.200]   is taken from a real case.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.240]   Guess who ended up as the defendant?
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.320]   In the actual case,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.760]   the defendant was Fineman's 92-year-old widowed
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.160]   great aunt Ellen.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.000]   As it turned out,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.920]   she had purchased the car for Fineman as a gift to him.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.480]   Abel's private investigator searched the assets
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.160]   of Fineman's relatives and found that Aunt Ellen
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.920]   had a house that she owned and some savings in the bank.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.880]   She was named as the defendant in the case
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.400]   and was found liable on a theory
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.320]   called negligent entrustment.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.260]   The jury found that she should not have bought
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.360]   the car for him.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.480]   She should have known that he was a careless driver
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.080]   and might cause an accident.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.820]   She caused the accident by buying him the car.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.600]   The verdict was for $932,000
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.260]   and Aunt Ellen lost nearly everything she owned.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.060]   That comes from a book by Robert Mintz.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.960]   You can see why these two things have to go together.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.280]   Expanded theories of liability and deep pockets
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.400]   are the key to who gets sued and why.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.920]   We read another few examples
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.360]   from a different estate planning,
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.480]   or asset protection planning book,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.400]   where the author is talking about this problem
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.160]   and talking about why the concept
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.560]   of indirect civil liability,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.160]   which is a liability that attaches to someone
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.360]   other than the person who commits the legal wrong,
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.480]   the tort, is perhaps the biggest threat to wealthy people
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.520]   because it allows plaintiffs to attach liability
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.560]   to almost anyone who has vulnerable wealth
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.040]   rather than to the person who actually committed the offense.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.320]   Indirect civil liability, excessive judgment awards,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.460]   and the following factors have turned our legal system
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.160]   from one of justice to one of redistributing wealth
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.400]   from the haves to the have-nots.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.720]   Most civil plaintiffs' attorneys are paid a percentage
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.880]   of amounts collected from litigation.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.720]   So the larger the judgment or settlement,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.040]   the more money they make.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.960]   This in turn means attorneys try to sue
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.760]   as many people as possible in any given case.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.360]   This is the reason for various theories
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.000]   of indirect liability.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.180]   Judges support theories of indirect liability
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.040]   which attach to the person with the most money
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.280]   rather than, or in addition to,
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.240]   the person who committed the offense.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.520]   Juries decide on emotions.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.600]   A Robin Hood mentality rather than sound legal reasoning
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.760]   are unpredictable at best and catastrophic
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.700]   to a defendant's wealth at worst.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.600]   Case in point, a large lawsuit
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.680]   against a giant stadium concession company
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.280]   resulted in a $110 million judgment.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.720]   And the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered a retrial
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.100]   because of several legal errors
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.920]   by the Superior Court's presiding judge
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.880]   which led to such a high verdict.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.440]   The injured party in this lawsuit was a two-year-old girl
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.980]   who was struck by a drunk driver
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.660]   that bought alcohol from the concession company.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.520]   No one will say that the permanent paralyzation
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   of an infant is not a great tragedy.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.720]   However, there's a strong trend in litigation
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.580]   that links emotionally charged cases
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.500]   to unusually high judgments.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.480]   Why was the drunk driver not sued?
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.600]   Why was the concession company's employee
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.400]   who sold the alcohol to the drunk driver not sued?
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.680]   Why only the deep pocket defendant?
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.260]   How many people lost their jobs
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.160]   because the deep pocket had to pay $110 million
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.860]   to the plaintiff which forced them
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.080]   to lay off employees as a result?
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.440]   One only has to randomly read a few civil cases
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.040]   to see how thoroughly established indirect liability
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.900]   has become in our legal system.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.140]   Study enough of these cases
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.160]   and you see many examples of indirect liability.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.480]   An employee causes damages,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.400]   so the employer is liable for the employee's actions.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.580]   A vehicle is involved in an accident.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.580]   The owner is liable even if they're not driving it.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.840]   A landlord fails to maintain property.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.260]   For example, they don't put salt on an icy sidewalk
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.440]   and someone is injured.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.200]   The non-managing property owner may be liable.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.520]   An individual buys a property for someone else.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.320]   The recipient then intentionally or unintentionally
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   uses that property to injure themselves or another.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.100]   For example, you give a hunting buddy a gun
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.160]   and then he shoots himself or someone else.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.600]   The gift giver is liable
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.760]   under the theory of negligent entrustment.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.640]   Yes, people have actually been sued for giving gifts.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.880]   A person refers someone to a business or service
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.440]   that ends up committing a tort.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.800]   The referrer can be sued as a result.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.200]   Litigation from this type of liability is common,
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.540]   especially among professionals
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.640]   such as CPAs, financial advisors,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   and attorneys who refer clients.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.480]   These are only examples of indirect liability.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.520]   Indirect liability can be further broken down
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.040]   into subsets such as lingering liability,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.560]   which we'll now discuss.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.620]   Lingering liability is a liability
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.080]   that may be triggered many years after the tort
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.100]   or negligent act was committed.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   To explain lingering liability,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.960]   let's examine a Texas case from several years back.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.080]   A home builder built a home to sell it.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.500]   He subcontracted another company to put in a septic system.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.620]   Instead of installing a proper septic system,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.060]   the subcontractor cut corners to save money
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.140]   and used a large propane tank.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.020]   10 years later, the propane leaked,
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.140]   raw sewage seeped through the home's foundation
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.380]   and into the walls.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.840]   Everyone living in the home,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.580]   including an eight-month-old baby,
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.100]   developed staph infections,
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.140]   which required hospitalization.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.980]   The original builder had operated as a sole proprietorship
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.160]   when the home was built,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.080]   was sued for a very large sum of money, and lost,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.700]   despite the fact that another company
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.580]   put in the faulty septic tank.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.240]   In this situation, we must ask ourselves,
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.460]   if at some point in the 10-year period
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.260]   between when the home was built and the septic tank leaked,
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.780]   I had sold or resold the home,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.260]   could I be named as a party on this lawsuit?
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.060]   Shouldn't a real estate property inspector
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.260]   have been able to determine
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.700]   an incorrect septic tank was installed?
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.360]   Hint, when's the last time you've seen
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.040]   a real estate inspector dig up a yard
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.660]   to look at a septic tank?
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.840]   The answer to the first question is yes,
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.900]   you could be sued if you sold a property with major defects,
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.020]   even if you didn't know about the defect,
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.360]   and even if a qualified professional inspected the property.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.660]   Remember, in court, the facts are not decided
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.500]   by real estate inspection experts.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.860]   They are decided by a jury
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.620]   who may not have the faintest idea about real estate.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.580]   The jury will most likely think, however,
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.100]   that someone who owns rental units
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.380]   or buys and sells real estate is rich.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.580]   They're angry that an eight-month-old baby was hospitalized.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.320]   Whether or not you could have detected
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.740]   and corrected the problem is beside the point.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.060]   Would this jury play Robin Hood?
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.740]   Would they take from the so-called haves, you,
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.220]   and give to the have-nots regardless of fault?
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.900]   Who's regardless of fault?
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.860]   In a country where over 30 million lawsuits
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.460]   are filed each year, it happens many times each day.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.680]   A similar situation happened to one of our clients
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.020]   long before he'd seen the need for asset protection.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.700]   His case falls not only under lingering liability,
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.540]   but also under something we call expanded liability,
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.020]   another type of indirect liability.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.220]   Many years ago, he operated a car dealership
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.620]   as a sole proprietorship.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.780]   He bought a used car with damaged brakes,
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.980]   sent the car to a mechanic shop for repairs,
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.560]   and then sold the car.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.060]   10 years later, the car was involved in an accident,
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.540]   which, unfortunately, resulted in multiple fatalities.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.180]   The car brakes had failed.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.060]   Even though the brakes had worked perfectly for 10 years,
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.620]   guess who got sued?
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.220]   That's right, the person who had operated his dealership
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.860]   as a sole proprietorship.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.660]   Fortunately, he only lost $50,000 in this case,
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.900]   but it could have turned out far worse.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.020]   Notice that his company wasn't even the one
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.420]   that fixed the brakes, yet it was the one that got sued.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.300]   This is a perfect example of expanded liability.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.900]   People are sued under theories of expanded liability
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.380]   because attorneys collect a percentage of the judgment
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.580]   or settlement award amount when they sue,
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.140]   so they have an incentive to sue as many people as possible
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.780]   for as much as possible.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.420]   More people sued equals more money,
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.300]   which means the attorney gets more fees.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.580]   Another highly public case more clearly illustrates
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.620]   how theories of expanded liability are used
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.140]   to go after deep pockets.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.500]   Earlier, we discussed a giant stadium concessionaire
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.300]   whose employee sold beer to an already inebriated man
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.500]   during a game.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.040]   After the game, the intoxicated man was involved
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.340]   in an accident, resulting in a fatality.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.780]   The drunk driver was broke,
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.060]   and even though he went to jail,
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.740]   the plaintiff's attorney didn't pursue anything
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.020]   beyond his insurance company's $200,000 payout,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.100]   nor did the employee who sold the beer
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.320]   pay a dime to the defendant, despite his poor judgment.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.780]   The employee's large and wealthy employer, however,
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:14.020]   lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay $110 million
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.420]   to the plaintiff.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.860]   Who had the money?
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.340]   Who got stung?
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.220]   If you are only remotely connected to a lawsuit
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   and no one else involved has significant assets but you,
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   who do you think the plaintiff's attorney will pursue?
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.140]   That excerpt comes from a book called
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.300]   Asset Protection in Financially Unsafe Times
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.620]   by Arnold Goldstein, who is a prominent author
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.980]   who's written a number of books on the subject,
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.480]   and Ryan Fowler.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.140]   I hope that you see with those examples
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.140]   how difficult this problem of various theories
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.020]   of liability really can be.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.580]   In the past, I've done a long series of shows
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:57.580]   on law enforcement, protecting yourself from legal risks.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.020]   And the reason I did that was to try to impress upon you
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.340]   the reality that you are vulnerable.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.860]   You are a criminal.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.860]   Under current US American law, you are a criminal.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.980]   Now, we don't know what law you've broken
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.820]   and neither do you.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.500]   But if we knew every detail of your life
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.020]   and if we had time and you had notoriety,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.900]   we could find a whole bunch of things to charge against you
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.460]   and find you to be a criminal,
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.140]   which is why it's so important for you
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.460]   to protect yourself from those risks.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.860]   That's hard for a lot of normal people to accept.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.900]   That's hard for a lot of people who think,
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.460]   I'm a good person, I'm a decent, upstanding citizen,
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.160]   I obey the law, but yet you're saying I'm a criminal?
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.900]   Yes, you are.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.980]   Today, you are committing felonies.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.220]   You just don't know what they are
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.740]   and neither does anybody else,
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.020]   until or unless you allow yourself to be pushed
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.420]   under the lens of investigation
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.020]   and then there's all kinds of things that can be found.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.460]   So that's the parallel in the criminal world.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.980]   The same thing applies, however,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.320]   in this context to civil litigation.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.860]   You are liable.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.060]   You have been negligent.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.220]   Somewhere along the line, at some point,
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.060]   even though you probably don't even know it,
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.540]   there is a set of facts that could be drawn against you
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.080]   for some of your behavior at some point in the past years.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.180]   And these things compound.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.940]   You didn't realize it at the time.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.320]   You were just operating under a normal life.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.740]   You were just simply saying, I'm just being a normal person.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.980]   I'm trying to be prudent in all my affairs.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.460]   But you were found negligent somewhere.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:42.540]   You could be found negligent by a motivated attorney
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.500]   with a set of facts, who has a victim
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.380]   and a sympathetic jury.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.540]   Because there are enough proven legal theories
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.360]   that could be found to hold you responsible.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.400]   That's why asset protection planning is so important.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.720]   Because you can't just be prudent.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.160]   One of my pieces of advice is be prudent,
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.880]   be careful, be thoughtful, be considerate.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.120]   But that's not enough.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.520]   It's not enough just to be a prudent, careful person.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.480]   Because when you're faced with this monstrosity
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.320]   of indirect liability, lingering liability, et cetera,
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.080]   prudence is not enough.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.960]   It's not enough.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.480]   That's the problem.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.060]   You might be a careful person.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.660]   You might be a prudent person.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.980]   You might be careful in all your hiring practices.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.980]   But if you hire people, in some fact patterns,
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.520]   you are liable for the behavior of those people.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.100]   Personally, you're liable for your employees.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.080]   You're liable for your equipment.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.440]   You're liable for all kinds of things.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.960]   There are enough examples that we could find.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.840]   Let me give you two more.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.940]   Back in the late '90s, there was a case
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.680]   in the United States of America
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   where a man named Wendell Williams went on a rampage
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.520]   with a gun and killed two people.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.200]   He went on a psychotic rampage and killed two people.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.640]   He sued a former psychiatrist of his
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.160]   named Dr. Myron Lipson.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.780]   You can go back, there's a 60 minutes episode of this
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.120]   that was done on the case.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.480]   If you can go back and find it.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.260]   So he sued his psychiatrist.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.160]   When Dr. Lipson first met Wendell Williamson,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.040]   Williamson was in law school.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.280]   He was 26 years old and he was in law school.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.560]   And he was brought in for an appointment
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.000]   because he had disrupted a law class
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.840]   claiming that he had powers of telepathy.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.160]   And so they brought him in to the psychiatrist
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.920]   for an emergency appointment to try to help with him.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   Now over time, the psychiatrist worked with him.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.160]   He evaluated him over time,
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.400]   diagnosed the patient as having paranoid schizophrenia
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.720]   and prescribed antipsychotic medication.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.920]   And evidently the patient showed signs of improvement.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.520]   Dr. Lipson went on to retire
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.720]   and he instructed his patient to continue treatment
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.360]   with his successor who was working there at the clinic.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.760]   The Williamson, the shooter,
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.700]   never after Lipson retired,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:26.120]   never went to go back to see the successive psychiatrists.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.080]   And then he stopped taking his antipsychotic medication.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.540]   And then one day he got a gun,
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.840]   he went out and shot and killed two people.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.080]   So he sued the psychiatrist
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.540]   claiming that the psychiatrist should have followed up
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.760]   and made sure that he see the successor physician
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   and should have warned him more
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.840]   about the potential of his psychosis,
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.160]   that he would cause more problems.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.160]   And at trial, Williamson was awarded $500,000 of damages
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.720]   from Dr. Lipson who had not seen him
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.120]   for eight months before the shooting
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.340]   and whose orders of medical care the patient had ignored.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.640]   Now the problem in this case,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   Dr. Lipson was openly acknowledged in the court
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.440]   to be an absolutely superb psychiatrist,
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.880]   to be a phenomenal practitioner, to be very, very prudent.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.720]   And at the end of his career, he did the right thing,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.920]   retired from practice,
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.040]   did the right thing with his patients.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.240]   That's tough.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.040]   You know, one of the hardest things, anyway, that's tough.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.240]   The point is it was rightly a scandal at the time,
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.040]   front page news, there's a reason why it was on 60 Minutes,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.640]   but yet still Lipson was found guilty.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.440]   If that doesn't chill you to the bone, it really should.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.200]   Let me read you one other example.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.320]   The second example I said,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.840]   and this comes from the Mintz book.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.280]   A wealthy client, Alan, invested $10,000
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.800]   in a software development business
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.760]   owned by a college acquaintance.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.880]   Mark, Alan received 2% of the stock in the company,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.920]   put away the certificates
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.760]   and didn't think about it again for several years
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.280]   until one day he was served with a lawsuit.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.320]   The suit alleged that the company had breached a contract
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.920]   to develop a particular program for a customer.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.760]   The failure to deliver the program on time
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.920]   had cost the customer millions of dollars.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.640]   He was now suing for $25 million.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.680]   Alan was named as a defendant, together with the company,
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.280]   which was primarily a service business
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.480]   with no substantial assets.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.440]   It was clear that the real target in the case was Alan
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.800]   and not the company.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.320]   Alan had $3 million in stocks and bonds
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.680]   and several brokerage accounts.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.800]   And this was the prize the plaintiff was after.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.880]   The case was disturbing.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.840]   From a legal standpoint, Alan, as a minority shareholder,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.680]   not even an officer or director,
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.880]   had no liability for any obligations of the company.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.600]   Even if the damages were caused, as alleged,
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.720]   Alan had no input or responsibility
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.680]   for the operations of the business.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.480]   The case had been filed solely because the other side
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.680]   had run an asset search on all of the shareholders
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.520]   looking for a shakedown target.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.560]   And they hit the jackpot when they found Alan's accounts.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.800]   The attorney for the other side later admitted to us
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.880]   that if they hadn't found Alan's money,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.640]   they wouldn't have filed the case.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.480]   They had nobody else to go after.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.520]   But now they had a perfect setup.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.160]   Although Alan had no real liability,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.840]   what happens in court is often different
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.480]   than what we think should happen.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.400]   As a named defendant in the case,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.040]   and the only one with money, Alan faced a difficult choice.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.760]   Fight or settle?
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.600]   If he fought, there was a risk that he could lose the lawsuit
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.080]   with damages of several million dollars, plus attorney fees.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.480]   That would probably wipe him out financially.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.680]   If he won the case, it would still cost $100,000 to $150,000
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.400]   in legal fees and expenses,
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.480]   and would absorb much of his time and emotions
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.320]   for at least the next few years.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.400]   The lawyer for the other side knew how to play the game.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.120]   After several months of painful negotiations,
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.440]   Alan settled the case for $450,000.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.080]   It was difficult for him to pay the money,
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.040]   mostly from an emotional standpoint,
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.040]   because he had done nothing wrong.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.640]   But he was trapped and outmaneuvered, and he had no choice.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.760]   By holding his money in an unprotected form,
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.400]   easily discovered and reachable, he was a vulnerable target.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.640]   The proper strategy, and the one Alan now uses,
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.040]   is to limit access to personal financial information
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.600]   and shield assets from potential claims.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.960]   That will minimize the threat from these types of cases.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.000]   That is the end of the stories I will share with you.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.120]   If you go out looking for them,
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.560]   you will find many yourself.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.480]   I am convinced, at this point in time,
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.840]   that it is impossible, no matter how prudent
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.080]   and careful you are in your affairs,
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.840]   as all of us try to be,
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.560]   it is impossible to be sufficiently prudent
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.760]   that you would eliminate the possibility
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.600]   that you would be found guilty in some form of case.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.640]   So this is the same conviction I came to
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   with regard to criminal law.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.920]   Why did I talk about, is the importance of you
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.720]   protecting yourself from being arrested
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.400]   and protecting yourself from the police?
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.080]   Because you are guilty today.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.320]   Same thing, you are negligent and liable today.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.640]   So, since you don't know where those risks are,
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.000]   you don't know what they are.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.320]   You don't know what happened 10 years ago
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.280]   when you were operating a business without a corporation.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.760]   You better get busy today and do your best
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.800]   to protect yourself when we're asset protection planning.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.920]   That's the major problem we're protecting against.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.800]   As I close out the show, I want to emphasize to you,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.080]   there are other risks that also fall in
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.760]   under asset protection planning.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.640]   Thus far, I have focused exclusively in this show
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.080]   on civil litigation, the concept of negligence,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.440]   liability, et cetera, and you're facing civil litigation.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.120]   But there are other risks which also have to come into play.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.280]   For example, bankruptcy.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.040]   Now, I hope that you take my advice
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.640]   that you don't borrow money recklessly,
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.680]   that you don't put yourself in a circumstance
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.600]   where you are going to be finally,
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.520]   you're living dangerously and you're just thinking,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.000]   "Well, I'm just going to file bankruptcy
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.200]   if something falls apart."
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.960]   But the reality is many people wind up in bankruptcy
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.160]   who were not reckless, who were not negligent.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.360]   Now, that can be because of a medical condition.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.600]   That can be because you were forced into bankruptcy
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.080]   by somebody who wanted to collect on some debt of some kind.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.600]   So, bankruptcy planning is another risk as part of this.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.720]   Any of us could wind up in bankruptcy,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.480]   even if you don't borrow money.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.160]   I repeat, any of us, no matter how much
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.200]   of a Dave Ramsey acolyte you are,
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.120]   'cause you don't borrow money,
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.120]   any of us can be forced into bankruptcy.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.360]   That is another huge risk.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.600]   And bankruptcy planning has to be part
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.240]   of asset protection planning.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   Another major risk involves divorce.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.400]   One of the biggest challenges that we face
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.200]   in the modern world is protecting assets from divorce.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.720]   Very, very difficult area of practice.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.400]   Because of course, none of us think
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.240]   we're going to get divorced,
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.920]   otherwise why would we have gotten married?
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.200]   None of us want to get divorced,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.640]   but no matter how diligently you and I work,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.080]   no matter how hard we are at maintaining our marriages,
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.200]   loving our wives, loving our husbands,
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.920]   making sure that you're diligent,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   can't predict what the future holds.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   You cannot predict it.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.360]   And though you were not at fault in a divorce,
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.000]   you can't control another person.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.520]   And yet your assets can be utterly wiped out by divorce.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.400]   So do we have to bring in divorce planning
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.200]   as a component of asset protection planning?
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.840]   It's a major, major challenge.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.320]   And then finally, of course, tax issues.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.040]   Dealing with the IRS or local tax authorities
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.760]   or state tax authorities, it's tough.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   And don't think for an instant,
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.040]   though you are honest and upright in all of your dealings,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.680]   don't think for an instant that the IRS
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.960]   or your local state tax court is your friend.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.520]   There are many, many examples you can find
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.520]   of egregious abuse by taxing authorities.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.840]   And here's the problem.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.160]   If you want to talk about an opponent,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.240]   a legal or financial opponent that is one of the toughest,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   the IRS has immense latitude, immense latitude
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:26.920]   with their ability to come after you.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.320]   And I consider some of the perspective,
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.880]   did you know if the IRS alleges
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.800]   that you owe them more than $50,000,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.680]   then they can cancel your passport
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.720]   and refuse to allow you to leave the country?
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.440]   Someday in the near future,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.800]   I'm gonna do a show on debtors' prisons.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.120]   A lot of people have this idea, this misconception
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.480]   that debtors' prisons are a thing of the past.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.560]   Nonsense.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.400]   They just look different
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.320]   than they did in Charles Dickens' day.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.280]   But one of them is dealing with the IRS.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.400]   There are others as well,
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.920]   especially involving divorce courts
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.000]   and child support alimony payments.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.960]   So we'll do that show another day.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.920]   But another one I have is slavery.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.640]   Slavery hasn't disappeared, it's just changed forms.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.160]   Now we put slaves in prisons,
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.040]   keep 5% of the US population there,
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.680]   instead of keeping slaves working in the fields.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.520]   Anyway, we'll do those shows another time.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.200]   So the IRS is a tough opponent,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.400]   and you have to consider tax planning
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.000]   and dealing with, if you're in a battle with the IRS.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.800]   It's not enough for you to be above board.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.180]   It's not enough for you to declare all your income,
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.680]   disclose all your assets everywhere in the world.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.560]   It's not enough for you to do the right thing with the IRS.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.680]   You still face risk with them.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.920]   Two stories I'll read you
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.880]   from the end of the Goldstein Fowler asset protection book
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.440]   where they're dealing with this topic of asset protection
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.560]   and the IRS.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.600]   It says,
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.960]   it's important to preface this chapter
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.920]   by saying that if you are liable for a tax,
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.200]   you should resolve the issue by paying
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.800]   or otherwise settling the debt.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.040]   In egregious circumstances,
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.580]   thwarting the IRS's efforts to assess or collect a tax
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.100]   may constitute a felony.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.720]   At the same time, there are instances
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.480]   where the IRS is overaggressive in its collection efforts
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.280]   and/or sometimes erroneously pursues people
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.400]   for taxes they don't actually owe.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.760]   Despite a plethora of cases that demonstrate this,
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.040]   some think they have nothing to fear from the IRS
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.120]   so long as they are honest taxpayers.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.500]   The following real life experiences show
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   this is simply not so.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.760]   An attorney named Jeff is married with four children.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.320]   His wife Linda is a stay-at-home mother
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.060]   who has not worked for many years.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.300]   One day to her surprise,
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.180]   she received an IRS 1099 form in the mail
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.340]   generated by a company she'd never heard of
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.980]   reporting that the company had paid her $350,000.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.800]   She does not report this as income
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   since she never received any money.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.840]   The IRS, however, claimed she was liable
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.160]   for over $100,000 in taxes
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.720]   based solely on a one-half page, unsigned document
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.680]   sent out by a company that shortly thereafter
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.020]   went out of business.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.040]   Jeff used his legal expertise to argue
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.200]   that the IRS has no proof of Linda receiving such income.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.720]   In fact, he said if the IRS could locate the money,
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.800]   he'd split it with them 50/50.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.440]   The IRS disagreed without even auditing the company
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.840]   that generated the form and a legal battle ensued.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   Over eight years later, the issue remains unresolved.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.240]   Fortunately, Jeff has experience representing clients
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.120]   with IRS problems, which saves them
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.280]   tens of thousands of dollars in attorney's fees
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.960]   they'd otherwise have to pay.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.360]   Nonetheless, Jeff never figured
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.320]   he'd have his own wife for a client.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.720]   The IRS contacted Chuck, a real estate developer,
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.760]   and claimed he owed $30,000 in back taxes.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.400]   After his CPA went to bat for him,
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.720]   the tax debt was reduced to around $8,000.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.920]   Chuck cut a check for that amount and mailed it to the IRS.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.480]   A few weeks later, it was returned
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.200]   with a letter stating the case was closed
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   and the matter dropped concerning his alleged liability.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   Several years later, the IRS contacted Chuck again.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.160]   They said he'd never have paid the original tax debt
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.520]   and now owed the IRS over $50,000
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.140]   due to penalties and interest.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.720]   This was based on the $30,000 original assessment,
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.940]   not on the subsequent correct assessment of $8,000.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.120]   Chuck protested that he had mailed them a check
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.320]   to pay the debt several years earlier.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.160]   The IRS stated they had no record
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.760]   of ever receiving payment
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.800]   and that the case had never been closed.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.160]   What happened as a result?
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.960]   Chuck had $30,000 seized from his bank account
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.360]   along with two plots of land,
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.380]   which were sold to pay off what the IRS claimed he owed,
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.820]   even though he'd already sent them.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.640]   Whether it is incompetence or disregard for law
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.920]   that sometimes leads federal and state tax agencies
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.200]   direct the lives of law-abiding citizens,
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.560]   the need for asset protection
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.680]   against such threats is indisputable.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.880]   So, and it goes on and talks about
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.460]   how to plan against the IRS.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.440]   The point is this,
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:39.240]   don't get complacent even about things like the IRS.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.160]   If you were to go back,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.340]   one of the things that finally last year,
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.080]   the Operation Chokepoint was closed
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.760]   by the Department of Justice.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.160]   It was Operation Chokepoint, if you're unfamiliar,
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.200]   was an initiative that was begun
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.320]   under President Obama in the United States,
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:59.160]   where back in 2013,
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.720]   various disfavored businesses
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.840]   started to find themselves in all kinds of problems,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.520]   where all of a sudden their bank accounts were being closed
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.360]   and they're having trouble.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.240]   The first people who brought the subject,
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.520]   the story to public notice were porn actresses
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.920]   and payday lenders,
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.680]   who suddenly find themselves with their banks closed down,
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.080]   bank accounts closed down for no reason.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.940]   And they hadn't had any overdrafts or anything else,
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.920]   but they're just, and they go and ask their banks,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.520]   like, "Why are you closing our accounts?"
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.200]   And I said, "Well, you're high risk."
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.720]   And so of course, the Obama administration
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.000]   denied that there was anything involved,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.360]   just like they did when the IRS
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.900]   was not issuing appropriate tax exemptions
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.240]   for right-wing political groups.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.880]   I said, "Oh, it was just nothing at all."
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.280]   Well, in hindsight, it was an organization,
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.040]   it was an action called Operation Chokepoint.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.920]   And the government was bringing pressure on banks
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.060]   to diminish and stop doing business
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.000]   with various businesses that were disfavored.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.680]   And this was, again, pornography,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.840]   payday lending, fireworks, online gambling,
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.200]   home-based charities, as seen on TV,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.080]   people who sell tobacco online
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.800]   or pharmaceuticals online, et cetera,
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.360]   firearms dealers, pawn shops, et cetera.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.600]   These were all kind of abused by this.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.960]   And this is the same thing
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.680]   that is happening again and again today.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.340]   And it's happening sometimes overtly
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.380]   and sometimes covertly.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.780]   One of the major challenges
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.940]   that many organizations have
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.660]   is the law is being brought to bear upon banks.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.980]   I won't go on and on against it.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.660]   So the point is, what do you do
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.820]   when you're involved in something
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.780]   that is entirely fine, entirely legal,
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.060]   but all of a sudden now your bank
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.480]   won't do business with you?
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.020]   Now, in this case, I'm getting a field of the IRS,
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.660]   but I consider the weaponization of this stuff
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:57.640]   to be a real problem
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.600]   with the IRS's whistleblowing program.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.360]   You want to have your life be nuts?
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.360]   Recognize that anybody can make a claim
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.660]   as a whistleblower to the IRS,
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.880]   an alleged tax evasion.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.760]   And if tax evasion or fraud is found,
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.720]   then that whistleblower is entitled
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.160]   to receive a portion of the claim.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.880]   So don't ignore things like the IRS
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:26.620]   because you think, "Well, I just pay my taxes,
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.420]   declare all my income, pay my taxes, everything is fine."
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.580]   That doesn't mean a thing in today's world.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.140]   Sorry, that was too strong.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.900]   That's good.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.520]   That's a good start, but it's not enough.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.300]   When your ideological opponents
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.220]   who think that you shouldn't be a payday lender
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.740]   or think that you shouldn't sell guns
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.980]   or who think that you shouldn't be a porn actress
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.040]   or who think that you shouldn't be
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.600]   on the Southern Poverty Law Center hate group list,
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.440]   and now all of a sudden
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.000]   you're dropped by your credit card merchants,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.920]   you're dropped by your bank accounts,
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.640]   you don't think that the IRS can't be involved in that.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.220]   We face a tough world
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:11.440]   where people who are your ideological enemies,
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.680]   wherever you are,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.920]   feel that the best way that they can destroy you
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.900]   is instead of arguing with you on the field of ideas,
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.340]   they want to destroy you with the force of law.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.440]   So I hope that I have put a little bit of reason for you.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.600]   I know I was strong in some of what I said.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.800]   I hope that I've been appropriately modest
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   to point out to you some risks.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.560]   I tried to put a little bit of fear in you.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.240]   I tried to use a little bit of sensationalism in this show
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.000]   because I want you to move off of zero onto go.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.440]   I want you to do something
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.920]   because as we'll see in subsequent shows,
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.000]   if you don't act today,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.560]   you won't be properly protected
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.020]   when the circumstances arise
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.720]   that you have no concept of today.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.660]   You can't buy life insurance
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.500]   when you're diagnosed with cancer.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.700]   You got to buy life insurance
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.420]   when you're young and healthy and don't need it.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.300]   You can't buy disability income insurance
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.180]   when you fall off your roof.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.420]   You got to buy disability income insurance
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.900]   when you're young and healthy and don't need it.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.280]   You can't buy asset protection planning
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.820]   when a lawsuit is filed against you.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:27.160]   You got to take the actions today to protect your assets
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.840]   when you are rich and stable and prudent
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.440]   and you can't foresee any risk
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.200]   because when three years from now,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.280]   you go and start a company
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.520]   and just make a simple mistake of some kind,
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.280]   as in operate it without a protective entity
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.220]   or hire an employee who subsequently
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.300]   sues you for sexual harassment,
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.660]   even though you had no harassment,
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.100]   had no contact with them whatsoever,
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.540]   but because you rebuffed their advances,
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:54.620]   their sexual advances,
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.680]   they accuse you of sexual harassment,
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.160]   whatever the circumstances are,
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.860]   you've got to do it today.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.860]   Here's the good news.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.140]   If you feel like I'm too strong,
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.900]   if you commit fraud,
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.420]   if you commit criminal wrongdoing,
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.020]   you will be found out
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.840]   and your asset protection planning
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.840]   can be unwound most of the time.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.360]   So don't worry.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:21.520]   If you are an evil person,
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.280]   there's really very little you can do.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.240]   But if you are an upright person,
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.020]   a good person, a moral person,
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.520]   just concerned about protecting the things
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.880]   that you've put together,
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.280]   stay tuned in this series.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.040]   There's a lot you can do.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.420]   Hope you have a great day.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.240]   Ad for today at the end of today,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.680]   new products will be coming out next week.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.920]   I'll share more announcements
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.240]   starting next week.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.720]   I will be, put it this way,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.760]   I will be much more stable in my production,
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.380]   in my location, et cetera,
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.320]   starting very soon.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.280]   And you will see that reflected in the content.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.800]   But for today, I would encourage,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.120]   if you haven't yet purchased my credit card program,
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.960]   I would encourage you to go to
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.280]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcards.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.300]   I'm sorry, credit card course,
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.320]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.100]   And if you have a credit card,
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.320]   or if you think you'll ever have a credit card,
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.280]   then I would recommend to you that you buy my course.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.240]   And here's why.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.200]   I try to tease you,
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.840]   and some of the times I do these little blurbs,
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.560]   I try to tease you to go and check it out.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.880]   And I try to use things that are a little bit sensational
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.280]   to try to do it.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.360]   But the whole point is not sensationalism.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.880]   The point is for you to think in advance
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.920]   about the future that is unknowable to you today.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.960]   So for example,
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.680]   if you think there could ever be a circumstance
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.040]   in which you would have credit card debt,
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.080]   as in, and my point is you have credit cards.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:38.920]   If you have credit cards,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.740]   it would ever have credit cards.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.440]   And there's a point at which you might have credit card debt
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.720]   no matter how committed you are to paying it off.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.440]   There's a point at which you might have credit card debt.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.040]   And there are lots of good circumstances
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.780]   under which we'd say that's a good thing to do.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.020]   You need to think today about getting in place
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:53.720]   the resources you would need in that circumstance.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.540]   That's why you need my credit card course.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.740]   You need to think today about the infrastructure
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.600]   that you would establish to protect yourself
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.920]   if you wound up in credit card debt
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.360]   and wound up battling with your credit card companies.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.320]   That's why you need my credit card course.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.400]   Could go on and on.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.000]   But this is the essence of financial planning.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.600]   Forethought, imagining scenarios
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.040]   and thinking about what you can do today
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.980]   to protect yourself from a future unknowable risk.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.240]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.

[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.600]   I have yet sold you.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.080]   And it is probably the cheapest product
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.080]   I will ever sell you.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.360]   It's 40 bucks, $39.
