[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - All right, the next question is about balancing
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.960]   and balancing ambitious with everyday life.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.400]   - Hey, Cal, this is Saheem from India.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.360]   Thanks for your podcast and I really enjoy it.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.600]   My question to you is that
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.440]   how do you balance ambition with life?
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.080]   I see many entrepreneurs and leaders say that
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.600]   they are overly ambitious
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.280]   and have very little time available for life
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   and health related tasks.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.400]   On the other side of the spectrum,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.360]   I see more people having regrets
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.000]   about not meeting their potential.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.440]   So how should we find this ambition life balance?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.280]   Thank you.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.760]   - Well, it's a critical question.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.520]   And I think it's one that we're not necessarily
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.360]   dealing with in a sophisticated manner right now
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.920]   in our cultural moment.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.800]   The way I read our current moment is that
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.120]   in the first decade of the 2000s,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.120]   we had a emphasis on crushing it, right?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.520]   I mean, this was a time where we were,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.560]   especially in American culture,
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.720]   lionizing the new wave of tech entrepreneurs
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.440]   and that burst of the whole like Zuckerberg, Musk,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.600]   that whole world, Bezos, et cetera, right?
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.320]   So we were like into like these people
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.080]   who got after it up all night,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.720]   moving fast, breaking things,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.400]   building fortunes, changing the world.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.680]   This was also the period of like Sheryl Sandberg
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.520]   and Lean In.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   And so there's definitely an emphasis of
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.200]   we were pretty activity oriented.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.000]   And then we whipsawed.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.520]   So now more recently,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.400]   we have the anti productivity movement.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320]   So we've gone hard the other direction
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   and we can look at things like Ginny O'Dell's book,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.640]   or which was, I always mix it up.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.680]   It's How to Do Nothing,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.240]   or I think it's How to Do Nothing,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   or the Art of Doing.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   I think it's the How to Do Nothing.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.840]   And then Chelsea Headley had Do Nothing.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.080]   There's Berkman's book, which I really enjoy, 4,000 Weeks.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.200]   But there was a pushback in the other direction,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.680]   which was we shouldn't really be doing things
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.320]   like productivity in general is constructed.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.560]   And depending on who you talk to,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.400]   you get different extremes on this.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.960]   So like, I think Berkman has a much more milder
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.400]   setup to this, which is just like,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.480]   hey, in general, we're excited about doing two things,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.840]   but we set our aspirations too high.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.480]   And on the other extreme,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.920]   you have the commentators to think like all of productivity
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.440]   is basically exploitative mythology
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.600]   created by capitalists to oppress
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.280]   the new digital age proletariat.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   So it gets pretty extreme,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.680]   but it's more of let's normalize this idea
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.280]   that the drive to do action is all kind of fake anyways,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.320]   and you should be okay just chilling.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.360]   Do nothing, how to do nothing, et cetera.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.280]   So we've kind of gone too far in the other direction.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.840]   That's not really working either
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.160]   because humans like to do things,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.320]   and we like accomplishment,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.640]   and we like to make long-term plans and execute them.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.920]   You can actually point to the specific sectors
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.720]   of the brain that evolved in humans
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   that we don't share with our primate ancestors
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   that actually help us make those plans and reward them.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.600]   It's what helped our species differentiate.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.320]   So there's a deeply human aspect of having goals
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.080]   that you then make a plan for and execute
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.760]   and see your intentions being manifest
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.800]   concretely in the world.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.840]   So just telling people like, let's just chill,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.360]   it's important that we normalize
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.920]   that you don't have to be a superhero,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.200]   but that doesn't do it either.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.480]   And I think this question gets right at that tension.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.080]   So my answer here,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.760]   this is where I become a bigger believer
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   in this term I've been trying to popularize,
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.200]   slow productivity.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.920]   And this is a concept that's still in development.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.800]   It's embryonic.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.840]   I change what it means each time I talk about it.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.800]   So you're seeing this in real time.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.360]   But critical to slow productivity is this idea of,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   yes, seeking out accomplishment, but on larger timescales.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.000]   Over the next few years,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200]   I care about what I produce over the next few years
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.080]   that I've produced some things of real value.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.880]   When you're focused on execution at that slower timescale,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.960]   it gives you a lot of breathing room and flexibility
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.840]   on the small timescales.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.080]   When you're trying over the next two year period
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.480]   to produce something that you're proud of,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.680]   a product or a piece of writing,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.520]   that allows you next Tuesday
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.800]   to just be with your kids and do nothing.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.480]   Because on the larger timescale,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.920]   that one day is not that important.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.800]   It allows you to have a month where you're really pushing it
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.320]   and then a month where you're taking a breather.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.760]   Three months where you're just doing research
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.200]   and a summer when you're at a cabin
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.440]   and writing six hours a day.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.600]   It's seasonal, it's varied, it's diverse.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.040]   It fits the rhythms of the human condition.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.120]   Slow productivity feeds into all of that.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.320]   I think this is probably the ideal setup
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.560]   for satisfying the human desire to accomplish
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.440]   is that you are working on a small number
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.000]   of important things.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   You return to it and you hone your craft
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.600]   and you try to be so good they can't ignore you.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.560]   But this is work that is diligently applied
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.120]   over long periods of time.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.480]   And when you look back five years later,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.760]   you're proud of what you produced
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   and you don't care so much about what happened
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   in the last five hours.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.720]   That I think is where you get that balance
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   where most people are gonna be happy.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.920]   So how do you introduce this all into your life?
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.040]   Well, again, this is where doing
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.120]   the multi-scale planning is important.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.480]   Have your semester plan that feeds into a weekly plan,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.440]   which feeds into a daily time block plan.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   That semester or quarterly plan,
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.000]   whatever you wanna call it,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.760]   helps you see what you're working on
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.960]   in this big picture for the next three or four months.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   And then that can filter into your week
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.320]   where you say what days we wanna work on this, if any.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   And then that filters into your day.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.640]   And it allows you to have clarity
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.120]   but adapt your execution of that clarity
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.720]   over the realities of what's really going on in your life
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.600]   and the busy times, not busy times, et cetera.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.760]   So basically my advice here is be ambitious
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   but slow down your execution of those ambitions.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.920]   Be proud of what you produce five years from now,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.080]   which again is gonna require your planning at multi-scale
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.560]   so you don't just do nothing for months,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.920]   but be really easy on yourself about what you do this week.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   Because it's a hard week because your kid's homesick
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.760]   and there's a deadline for another work-related project
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.600]   that's annoying you.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.420]   And it's okay to be annoyed.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.720]   It's okay not to get much done that week.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.920]   So be ambitious, but slow down
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.520]   the execution of that ambition.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.560]   For most people, I think that's gonna be the sweet spot.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.780]   (upbeat music)
