[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words recorded in the seventh
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.320]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning with these two verses.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.160]   "Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:26.320]   And he, Stephen, said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken, the God of glory appeared
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:34.840]   unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charon."
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.440]   And from there on until the end of the fiftieth verse, Stephen, in this speech and address
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.240]   which he delivered to the court of Jerusalem called the Sanhedrin, gives a great review
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.380]   of the history of the Jewish people.
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.380]   Why did he do this?
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.800]   Well, you are given the explanation in the previous chapter.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.960]   This man Stephen, with a number of others, had been appointed as a deacon in the early
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.360]   Infant Christian Church.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.160]   And he proceeded to carry out his duties.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.360]   But in addition to that, he did great wonders and miracles, we are told, among the people.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.600]   And the result of this was that certain people rose up against him and brought false charges
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.000]   against him, and brought these charges to this great court, the Sanhedrin.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.760]   They summoned men which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   and against God.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.800]   And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and came upon him and caught
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.600]   him and brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses which said, This man ceaseth
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.680]   not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.200]   For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.900]   change the customs which Moses delivered us.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.440]   And there he stands before them.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.600]   We read this, All they that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.160]   it had been the face of an angel.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.480]   And then, the high priest presiding puts this question to Stephen, Are these things so?
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.600]   Are these charges which are proffered against you true?
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.280]   And Stephen begins his reply.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.520]   And as I say, the bulk of this chapter, at least the first 50 verses, and indeed beyond
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.000]   that, contain his reply to these charges.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.280]   Now, why are we considering this?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.480]   One may say, That's all right, that's a bit of old history, interesting no doubt in its
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   own way, as we find Greek history and other bits of history interesting, but what's it
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   got to do with us?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.400]   What's it got to do with the modern world?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.000]   What's it got to do with my life and the problems that are perplexing me at this present moment?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.400]   Well, no, that's a perfectly fair question to put.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.280]   And it's my business to show you the relevance of all this to your case and to the case of
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.640]   every one of us at the present time.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.080]   We are not met here, I assure you, just to entertain one another.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.320]   We are not here simply to carry out some custom.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.800]   We are here for one reason only, and that is because of our problems, the whole state
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.040]   of our lives, that's why we are here.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.320]   We are seeking for an answer, and it is because I want to show you through a study of this
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.040]   address, this sermon preached by Stephen the Martyr, that he deals so directly and in such
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.240]   an extraordinary relevant manner with the essential problems of the modern man, that
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.760]   I'm directing your attention to it.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.060]   You see, this is our position.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.720]   There is only one hope for men in this world, and it is this gospel.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.480]   There is no other.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.480]   The world is proving that tonight.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.800]   The only hope for the individual or for the whole world is this gospel of our Lord and
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.480]   Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.120]   But people don't believe it.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.680]   The masses of people don't believe it.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   Why not?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.960]   Now that's exactly where this comes in.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.980]   I'm trying to show that people reject the gospel today for almost the precise reasons
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.800]   that they've always rejected it from the very first beginning, such as we have it put before
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   us here.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.680]   It's prejudice based upon false ideas of religion.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.240]   You see, the trouble with these Jews, these members of the Sanhedrin, was that they thought
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.300]   they were all right as they were.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.160]   They didn't understand their own history.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.180]   They didn't understand the things they believed in.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.480]   They thought they did.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.520]   They were proud of their history.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.760]   Stephen shows them that they've never understood it.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.000]   They were proud of their temple.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.040]   Stephen shows them very simply and very clearly that they've misunderstood the whole point
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.280]   of temple worship.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.760]   They were very proud, especially, of Moses and the law that was given through Moses.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.880]   They were God's people who had the law.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.640]   The pagans didn't have this law.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640]   Stephen shows them so plainly as our Lord himself had done before him, that they've
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.520]   completely misunderstood the nature, the character, and the intent and the purpose of the law.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.960]   Now that's exactly what he does.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.140]   And I, in dealing with this last Sunday night, and I've just given you a summary of what
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.800]   I said, I showed that this is still the problem.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.600]   Why do people reject this gospel?
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   Because they think they're all right without it.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.440]   Many think they've already got it.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.040]   They misunderstand Christianity.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.240]   They're still unclear about these vital matters.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.720]   They're trusting to some religion, to their own practices, to their own good deeds and
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.120]   works.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   But the essence of this matter is the realization of who the Lord Jesus Christ is, and our utter
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.080]   dependence upon him.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.760]   And there they are as blind as these members of the Sanhedrin were blind in the first century.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.040]   Very well, there's the background.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.720]   You see, Stephen was addressing people in that sort of condition.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.600]   And you've got to bear that in mind.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.960]   You can't understand this speech unless you realize the background.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.080]   Stephen was a very good preacher.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.600]   He preached to the people who were listening to him, not to some imaginary people.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.880]   There's a lot of preaching today that's about people in South Africa or South America, not
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.560]   to the people in Great Britain.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   But Stephen's a good preacher.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.760]   He preaches to the people sitting in front of him or standing in front of him.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.720]   And not only that, he preaches to their condition.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.120]   And I'm trying to show you that the gospel of Jesus Christ still does this self-same
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.120]   thing.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.280]   What's it got to say to us?
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.040]   Well, you notice the first word.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:08.400]   I ended with it last Sunday night, "Hearken, men, brethren, and fathers, hearken, listen."
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   Why?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.080]   Well, he tells them, "What I'm going to say to you is not easy.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   It demands the whole of your attention and concentration.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   It demands your mind, your brain, your reason."
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.560]   Stephen didn't tell these people a number of affecting stories about women and babies
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   and things like that and made them cry.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080]   Not at all.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   It's sheer reason.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.080]   It's argument.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   It's demonstration.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.760]   It takes them through their history, shows them their error, their misinterpretation.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.200]   It's truth coming to the mind.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.520]   But he says it's going to be against the grain.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.400]   It'll cut across your prejudices.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   You won't like it.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.760]   I appeal to you, therefore, he says, be open-minded.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.560]   Control your prejudices, your violence.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.960]   These members of the Sanhedrin, though they were very learned and great people, most of
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.360]   them have already given abundant evidence already that they're very prejudiced and
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.440]   very passionate people.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.500]   We are told later on here that they were cut to the heart when they heard these things.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.560]   They were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.940]   Learned, intellectual people.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.480]   You see, this is passion, he says, Harkin, listen, control yourselves.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.040]   Don't be governed by cliches.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.560]   Don't just make statements without knowing what you're saying.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.840]   Listen to the case.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   Be open-minded.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.480]   Be ready at any rate to give it a chance.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.160]   And I make once more this same appeal.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.000]   Well, now, what are we to Harkin to?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.760]   Now, here's the great question.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.920]   What are we to Harkin to?
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.880]   What did Stephen tell these people?
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   Well, as I'm telling you, for 50 verses he goes over their history, gives them, as it
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   were, a lesson in history.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.560]   The bulk of his sermon is a review of history.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   Why did he do this?
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.260]   Well, it wasn't because they didn't know their history.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.260]   They did know it.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.800]   They were very proud of it, as I say.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.160]   People generally know their own history, 1066 and so on.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   You see, we know our history, don't we?
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   Very well.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   They knew their history.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.920]   Well, why does he take them through all this history?
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.040]   Why doesn't he come to the point, you say?
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.520]   Why go through all this long dissertation?
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.880]   That's the whole secret.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.280]   He does it not because they didn't know the facts, but because they'd completely misunderstood
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.080]   them, because they'd entirely misinterpreted them, and therefore he takes them through
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:47.040]   these familiar facts in order to show them their real meaning and their real significance.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:55.600]   So this is a great lecture, if you like, dissertation on history, and I am here to say that this
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.920]   is the first thing that the Gospel always does.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.960]   Does that surprise any of you, I wonder?
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.040]   Are you amazed that this is the first statement of the Gospel—history?
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:15.440]   The God of our fathers appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.360]   he dwelt in Charon—history.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.560]   Now this is a most important matter, and that is why I want to emphasize it this evening.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.000]   It is just at this point that so many go wrong at the present time.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   What do I mean by this?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.680]   Well, I mean this.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.880]   People get into trouble about this faith, this Christian faith, this Christian message,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.480]   because they will persist in starting with particulars instead of starting with the whole.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.600]   Now there are particulars to the Gospel, yes, but you'll never understand them unless
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.400]   you've got the whole.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.760]   You have to believe the whole of this before you'll ever understand the parts.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.600]   That's where so many tragically go astray today, as they have been doing throughout
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   the running century.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:09.360]   You've got to start with a general look at the whole, and if you only do that, you
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.800]   will find that you'll get clarity and understanding about those perplexing parts that have troubled
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.720]   you so much hitherto.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.680]   Now this is a great principle, of course.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.640]   It's a principle that governs the intelligence study of any subject.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.920]   If you start with particulars, you'll soon get lost.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:34.480]   You've got to have a general glimpse of the whole thing first.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.640]   Some of us who've done a little teaching, not only in this realm, but perhaps in other
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.720]   realms as well, have often had to make that very point.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.840]   I remember when studying Mitzvah, I found it advantageous myself, and I used to recommend
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.560]   the same thing to others, never to start with a really big textbook.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.720]   Start with a kind of smaller one, an elementary one, more or less a synopsis first.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.880]   Get a general idea, then on that you can build.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   Get a view of the whole, and then you'll have much less difficulty with the parts.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.680]   Well now, that's exactly what Stephen does.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.760]   Stephen, you see, doesn't take up these particular points and answer them directly and immediately.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.520]   "Well, wait a minute," he says.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:22.560]   And back he goes and paints on this big canvas, gives them a review of the whole of history,
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.360]   and then comes to his application to these particular points of theirs, the point being
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   that they can only be right about these in the light of the context, the grand whole
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.160]   of which they form parts.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.600]   And that is why we must do the same thing this evening.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:48.440]   Now, I'm doing this because, to me, it's a tragedy that anybody should not be a Christian.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.360]   I'm sorry for anybody who's not a Christian.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.400]   I don't know how they live in a world like this.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   What do you live on?
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.760]   What are you living for?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.560]   What hope have you got?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.880]   What is life without this?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   I know the other side.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.880]   I've been in that position.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   I've tried it.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.000]   You've got nothing.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.600]   I'm sorry for anybody who isn't a Christian.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.720]   And therefore it is my heart's desire that in some little way I may be used of God to
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.760]   remove some of these initial difficulties, these big prejudices that prevent our seeing
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   the whole.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:28.000]   Therefore, I say, we've got to start with this history, which makes me say this, that
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.160]   this Christian message is not just a teaching of ideas.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.880]   That's the whole fallacy of today.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   People will think that this is just a gathering of ideas, that it's a sort of philosophy.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.880]   They even think, many of them, that that is the gospel, that the gospel is really just
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.080]   the teaching of our Lord and Saviour himself with regard to life and living.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   They think that is Christianity.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.440]   You know, the people who say, "Oh yes, I like the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.120]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   If only we could get people to practice those ideas, but of course, I'm not interested in
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.640]   virgin birth.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.880]   I'm not interested in miracles, not interested in atoning death, not interested in physical
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.840]   resurrection, not interested in Holy Spirit."
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.080]   Now, that's the view, isn't it?
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.520]   You see, ethical teaching, moral teaching.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.960]   Now, I'm here to say this, and this is vital.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.920]   This is the whole point Stephen is making and establishing.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:32.760]   The teaching of our Lord, of course, is of all importance, but the Christian message
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.600]   does not really consist even in the teaching of our Lord himself.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.720]   It includes that, but it's much bigger than that, it's greater than that.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.800]   Indeed, I go so far as to say this, the saving element in this gospel is not in our Lord's
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:58.520]   ethical moral teaching, but it is very definitely in this history.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:04.640]   What is this message, then, if it isn't a mere gathering of ideas and moral maxims and
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.200]   teachings or a philosophy of life?
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   What is it?
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.560]   Well, this is the astounding thing.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.680]   This book is primarily a textbook of history.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.160]   I'm preaching out of what is called the Book of Acts.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.440]   A better name would be the Book of Facts.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.600]   This is a book of history.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.040]   This is a book recording events, things that have literally taken place.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.680]   And Stephen, you see, goes back into history and starts by saying, "This happened, that
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   happened, that happened.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   Here it is.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   Listen to this.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   Here's your history."
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.120]   Always dealing with events and facts and happenings.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:50.440]   Well, you remember how people who were not yet Christian put this very perfectly on the
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   day of Pentecost in Jerusalem.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.000]   They suddenly heard about these disciples, these men, these simple ordinary ignorant
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.800]   men were speaking in some strange languages.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.600]   In other words, there were people there who were Parthians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.920]   in Mesopotamia and other places, they said, "What is this?
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.440]   We do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God."
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.240]   The first preachers were preaching about the wonderful works of God, not the wonderful
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.640]   teaching of God, that's in it, but the wonderful works of God, events, facts, things that have
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.440]   literally happened.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.800]   So Stephen, you see, gives this review of history.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.640]   And this is the first beginning of the preaching of the Christian gospel.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.560]   Now it is as important for us to know this today as it was then.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.720]   The Old Testament history is a part of the gospel.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.160]   The New Testament history is also a part of the gospel.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.800]   That is why, you know, in the gospels you have all those details.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   People sometimes say, "Well, I'm interested in the teaching of Jesus, but why all these
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.640]   details about Pharisees and scribes and about him crossing lakes and doing this, that, and
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   the other, and then why all those details about his death upon the cross?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.200]   Why do they go into all these details?
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.120]   Why don't they just say that he died?"
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   But they do go into details.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120]   Why?
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   Ah!
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   That's the whole answer.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120]   It's history.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   It's history.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.840]   And everything in this history is important.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.200]   You see, here we are, we're going to come to this communion table.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   What is this?
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.880]   Well, there's cut bread on it and there's poured out wine in it.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   But what's it mean?
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.480]   Well, Paul says it means this, "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:47.520]   you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread."
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   History.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.400]   Ordinary, if you like, cutting bread, breaking bread, pouring out wine.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   Yes, but it happened.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   You see, he did it.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.320]   It isn't, this isn't an idea.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.360]   This is, do this in remembrance of me.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   Something that's happened.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   It's concrete fact.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   It's event.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.880]   It's something that's taken place.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.960]   My dear friend, if you haven't started with this idea that it is what has happened, what
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:16.680]   has taken place, the events that make this message, you haven't begun to understand Christianity.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.960]   You're all wrong.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.720]   And your interest in particulars is of no value to you at all.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   These are the things that matter.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.800]   These are the things that save.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   History.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   Now, I'm emphasizing that we must never lose sight of this.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.600]   Stephen gives a review of Old Testament history, and Old Testament history is vitally important
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.400]   for us this evening.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   We want the history of the old, we want the history of the new, and we must understand
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.480]   the relationship between the two.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.360]   Why am I elaborating this?
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.920]   Well, I'm doing so for a reason that must be well known to many of you.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.520]   The popular idea today is this, that the Old Testament is no longer of any value whatsoever.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:04.160]   There are people who are amazed that Christians still have it in their Bibles, and still more
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.320]   amazed that they ever should preach from it.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.720]   The Old Testament, they say, it's all primitive, it's of no value, it's no use at all.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.120]   And so they dismiss it, and they disregard it altogether, alas, there are some in the
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.760]   church who are saying that kind of thing.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.400]   But you see, this is quite wrong.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.600]   Here is a preacher filled with the Spirit.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.360]   Here's the first martyr.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   What does he do?
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.040]   He preaches Old Testament history.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.240]   He preaches a sermon on Old Testament history.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.280]   And it's a vital part of this message.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.480]   We've still got to do this.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.480]   Why?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.560]   Well, for this simple reason.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:46.880]   You cannot hope to understand your New Testament except in the light of the Old Testament.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.640]   This is the message.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.680]   The God who acted in the old is the same God who acts in the new.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:00.080]   The God who is still acting, there is only one God, and he is from eternity to eternity.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.200]   He has the same purpose.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.520]   Same purpose in the old as in the new.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.160]   An increasing purpose, certainly, but it's the same purpose.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.120]   What have you got in the Old Testament?
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.080]   You've got the prophecy of the gospel that was to come, and the preparation for the gospel
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.520]   that was to come.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.080]   What is your New Testament?
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.120]   It is the fulfillment of the Old Testament promises, as Paul puts it to the Corinthians.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:30.400]   "All the promises of God are in him, yea, and in him are men, to the glory of God the
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   Father."
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.360]   Now, you see, these two are intimately related.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:41.320]   You cannot separate them, and indeed I go so far as to argue that you cannot understand
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   the New Testament in and of itself without the Old Testament background.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.480]   That is why you have what you must have often observed in the Gospels and in other places
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.800]   in the New Testament, so many quotations from the Old Testament.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.760]   Our Lord was constantly doing this.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.680]   So was the Apostle Paul.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.560]   We are told that when he got to Thessalonica, he went into the temple, the synagogue, as
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.840]   his custom was, and what did he do?
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.600]   He reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, proving and alleging that the Christ must
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.680]   needs have suffered, and that this Jesus which I preach unto you is the Christ.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   What was he doing?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   Well, he was taking the Old Testament.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:28.720]   He was preaching out of the Old Testament, reasoning, demonstrating out of the Old Testament
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.360]   Scriptures the truths concerning our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.080]   Well now then, you see, this is still a vital part of this preaching.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.720]   This is how the Church came into being.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:49.840]   It is essential, as St. Augustine, I think it was, put it so long ago, "The New Testament
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:57.160]   is latent in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is patent in the New Testament."
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.840]   That's a very good way of putting it.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.400]   That shows you, you see, the two belong together.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   You can't separate them.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   You can't divide them.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.960]   It was the Spirit of God alone that led the early Church, which was chiefly Gentile, remember,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.920]   to incorporate the Old Testament Scriptures, the Jewish literature as it were, with their
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   new documents.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:24.880]   It's one, the wonderful works of God, Old Testament, New Testament, all one, the actions
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.640]   of the same eternal God.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.560]   Well, that's the first reason.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:34.700]   Let me give you a second reason for starting with history.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:41.800]   The Christian faith, the Christian message, is not only interested in today, in the life
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:49.520]   of today, Christianity is not only interested in this twentieth century, it's interested
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.160]   in the past, it's interested in the whole of history, it's interested in the whole
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160]   of life.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.240]   You see, this is our fatal fallacy.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.980]   This is, of all things, that characterizes the modern man the most stupid, the most silly.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:11.180]   That he seems to start from this position, that there had never been a world or a human
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.840]   being until he came upon the scene.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.140]   This is the tragedy of the modern man and the modern world.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.960]   Man's got this inflated notion of the twentieth century man.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.500]   Surely the twentieth century man is the biggest fool that has ever been on the earth.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.700]   He bursts of his learning, his knowledge, his achievement, look at his world.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.980]   What a fool he is.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:38.580]   It's all, I say, partly due to this, that he seems to think that history began with
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.580]   him.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.660]   Oh, his way of putting that, of course, is this, we have grown up, we've come of age,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.480]   we are entirely different because of our knowledge.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.820]   And so, you see, he ignores the whole of past history.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.400]   And it's because he does that he doesn't understand this gospel.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.300]   But you see, the gospel insists upon your facing the whole of history.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.960]   And let me put it like this to you, here is Stephen, making this review of the history
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   of the Jews.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.220]   You say, "Has that got anything to do with us?"
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.020]   It has a tremendous lot to do with us, not because we're interested in Jews as individuals,
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.380]   we should be interested in them as individuals, as in all other individuals, but that isn't
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.380]   the point I'm making.
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.480]   Here is the thing that's interesting, the fact of the Jew.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.160]   How do you explain it?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.840]   You know something about the history of the Jews, you know how they've been persecuted
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.220]   and maltreated throughout the centuries, you know how so-called civilized nations have
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:42.380]   tried to put an end to them one after another, but the Jew as a nation persists.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.240]   How do you explain the persistence of the Jew?
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.400]   Now there's a question for you.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.700]   "Ah, you thought that the problem of Christianity was miracles, didn't you?
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.080]   Understanding miracles, it isn't."
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.960]   You explain the Jew, take something big, take a great section of history, look at this extraordinary
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.620]   race that is still here tonight in spite of all that has been happening to it, how do
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.620]   you explain it?
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.340]   Now Christianity is concerned about that.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.720]   You see, you can't understand history, you can't understand your modern world unless
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.600]   you go back and look at the whole of history.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   Christianity does this.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.760]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.680]   We are a part of what is called Western Civilization.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.420]   Where did it come from?
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.400]   What's the origin of Western Civilization?
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:40.280]   I read a great learned book about all this on my holiday, and there's a book that actually
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.080]   bears that very title, The Rise of Western Civilization.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.200]   The thing we are so proud of, Western people, greatest people that the world has ever known.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:56.960]   We've governed so much of the world, and the world is looking to us, Western Civilization,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.480]   United States of America, and the important part she's playing, where did she come from?
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   How do you understand the United States of America, and all these countries that belong
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.440]   to Western Civilization?
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.080]   Now, there's only one simple answer to all this.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.240]   You cannot begin to understand Western Civilization without this gospel.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.600]   It's impossible.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.160]   You've got to go right back.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.240]   You've got to take the teaching of the Bible.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.160]   You'll never understand even Western Civilization.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.000]   You'll not understand your modern world and its problems unless you go right back and
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.680]   take in the whole of history.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.800]   That's why I say you must start with history.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.320]   The first thing the modern man's got to have happen to him is this.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.240]   He's got to be knocked off his pedestal.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.520]   He's got to realize he's just ordinary, common human clay like all who've ever lived before
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.880]   him, every previous generation, and that he's a part of this whole process of history, and
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.720]   he's got to start looking at the whole before he concentrates over much upon his own self-importance
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.440]   and his modern problems.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.960]   That brings me to my third reason for emphasizing this historical element.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:15.120]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is not merely interested in moral problems or ethical problems.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.400]   Of course it's interested in them.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.740]   I'm saying it's not only interested in them.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.960]   People will persist in thinking that the Bible is just a collection of moral maxims and moral
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   teaching.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.760]   It is that, but it's infinitely more than that.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.120]   It is, I say again, primarily a textbook of history.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.400]   The gospel is not confined only to men's behavior.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.560]   The gospel is interested in men himself, apart from his behavior.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.620]   Where did men come from?
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.640]   What is the world in which he finds himself?
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.840]   Where did it come from?
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.440]   The gospel's interested in all that.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.160]   You know, this idea that you shed your Old Testament and only pick out a little bit of
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.920]   evangelistic message from the New and always keep on harping on that, it's a wrong way
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.040]   of preaching the gospel.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.200]   It's too small a gospel.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   This gospel takes in the cosmos, takes in everything, goes right back to creation itself.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.240]   We're all involved in the time process, aren't we?
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.720]   Time coming to an end, what's going to happen?
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.520]   Do you understand time?
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   We all ought to know something about time.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.480]   We're living in an evil time.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.520]   Is there to be a future?
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520]   What is time?
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.760]   Is there to be an end to time, or is life in this world endless?
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.080]   These are the questions.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:42.000]   The whole of life and living time and eternity, if there is such a thing, what's it all about?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.280]   How can I understand it?
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:51.140]   Now then, there is the background to the gospel, and it is as big and as great as that.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:56.240]   People reject the gospel in the main at the present time because they've never put it
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:04.400]   themselves into this great context of the whole world, the universe, and time, and all
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.200]   these great and final questions.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.820]   But here is the question.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.960]   What is the meaning of time?
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.840]   What's the meaning of history?
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.500]   And there's only one answer to the question, and Stephen gives it at once.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:29.100]   The God of glory—here it is, here's the message—the God of glory appeared unto our
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:35.100]   father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Cairo.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.940]   Now, this is always the starting point of the gospel.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:45.640]   I hope I'm not shocking anybody when I say that the gospel does not start with the phrase
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.820]   "Come to Jesus."
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.400]   It ends with it, it doesn't start with it.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.340]   The gospel starts with this, the God of glory.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.460]   Here's the preacher, here's the first martyr.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:07.100]   In other words, I'm saying again that the gospel doesn't start with men and his problems
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.100]   and ideas.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:13.940]   It doesn't start with men's deeds, it doesn't start with the twentieth century.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.340]   That's the whole of the modern fallacy.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.580]   Modern man always starts with himself and he ends with himself, he revolves around himself.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:33.860]   He's a megalomaniac, and that's where he fools himself, he's at the center, and everything
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.860]   revolves round about him.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.540]   I'm not surprised that the non-Christian, the man who doesn't even claim to be a Christian,
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:47.280]   does that, but what I do find very difficult to understand is how men claiming the name
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:55.020]   of Christian and Christian teachers and professors, in order to appeal to the modern man, are
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.540]   ready to agree with his first postulate that you must start with men.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:04.140]   I suppose in many ways the most influential theologian, they call him that, I wouldn't
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.040]   call him even a theologian, but he calls himself a theologian and he's called a theologian
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:14.180]   by the theologians, the most influential theologian on the continent of Europe today is a man
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.820]   of the name of Bultman, and this is what he says.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:25.620]   He says that we must substitute anthropology for theology.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:31.580]   That means, he says, you must substitute the study of men for the study of God.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.220]   He says it's no use going to the modern man and talking to him about God.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:39.260]   The modern man with his scientific background and all that is so true of him, he doesn't
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.260]   understand the supernatural.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.580]   You mustn't talk to him about God.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:47.420]   Start with men, anthropology, study of men rather than study of God.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:53.220]   There is no conceivable greater denial of the gospel than just that.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.380]   But that's popular teaching in the Christian church today.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:02.180]   There's a movement in America going by the name of the Death of God movement in the church,
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.980]   taught by theological professors.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.940]   God is dead.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.020]   What they mean is that the God of the Bible is dead.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.220]   The God of the theologians of the centuries, the God of the Christian church, until these
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.100]   people arrived, he is nonexistent, that's what they're saying.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:26.700]   Anthropology instead of theology, men instead of God, but my dear friend, that is the fallacy
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:33.380]   of Pharisees, the world is, as it is tonight, because it's forgotten God.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.780]   That's the whole trouble.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.300]   It was the essence of our Lord's message.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.440]   You remember how one day a clever man came to him, trying to catch him, a lawyer.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.140]   He said, "Tell us, which is the first and the greatest commandment?"
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:52.380]   You see, these lawyers in his time, they were experts on details and minutiae.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.060]   And our Lord said to them, "One day you are the people who tithe mint and rue, and then
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:01.180]   isn't coming, and have forgotten the weightier matters of the law, love, and things like
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.180]   that."
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.860]   Getting down to the details, like the modern men, you see, catch questions about particular
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.860]   details.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.860]   Hadn't seen the whole.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.540]   So they came and said, "Which is the first and the greatest commandment?"
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.820]   There were some 613 of them, and they wanted to know, "Which is your opinion as to which
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.020]   should be put first?"
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.940]   And he gave them a devastating reply.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.180]   They never expected it.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.300]   They wouldn't have asked the question if they had.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:27.600]   And this is what he said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.740]   thy soul, and all thy mind, and all thy strength.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.780]   That is the first and the greatest commandment, and the second is like unto it.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.100]   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.900]   You notice the order in which he puts them.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.340]   The modern man says, "How can I love my neighbor?
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.060]   How can I live with this man across the iron curtain, or bamboo curtain, or wherever it
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.820]   is, color, black and white, red and pink, and so on.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.820]   How can we do this?
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.020]   Men, how can I love my neighbor?"
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.420]   Our Lord's answer is this, "Don't start with that.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.860]   That's number two.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.340]   Number one, thou shalt love the Lord thy God."
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.820]   You'll never be able to love your neighbor as yourself until you know the truth about
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:07.820]   yourself.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.340]   And you'll never know the truth about yourself until you've seen yourself in the sight of
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.980]   God.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.820]   You must see yourself and your neighbor in the sight of God.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.220]   Then you'll begin to love him.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.860]   Not until then, and all the efforts of this century to bring people together are breaking
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.700]   down before our very eyes.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.200]   The advocates of United Nations and various other things are cutting one another's throats
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.140]   behind the scenes in all the political parties.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.140]   You'll never do it.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:40.900]   Man has got to start with God, and not with himself, the God of glory.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.380]   What does glory mean?
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.060]   It's almost impossible to define it.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.460]   Glory, it means majesty.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.220]   It means greatness.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.300]   It means wonder and amazement.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.820]   It means power.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:01.100]   But what it means above everything else is this, that God is one who is all together
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.540]   above the world and above man.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.300]   You see, we are looking horizontally.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.220]   We look at man and his problems, stops at the gospel.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   Look up.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.220]   Look up to God.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:20.700]   Look up into the heavens, the God of glory, this transcendent God that is not only denied
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:26.420]   by the world, but alas, as I said, denied by men in prominent positions in the Christian
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.420]   church.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.260]   And that's why the church is as she is.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.500]   That's why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:37.260]   The God of glory, the God of transcendence, the everlasting God who's above it all is
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.460]   the God who's being denied and who's forgotten.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.700]   That's where history comes in.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.420]   The God of glory, what does it mean?
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.460]   Well, I say it means that he's above everything.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.940]   He's above everything in himself.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.740]   He dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.500]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.260]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:11.500]   It's a part of his glory, in himself, beyond the boundaries.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:18.660]   As Stephen makes so clear, he's not a God confined to any buildings.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.180]   You see, that's the point these early preachers had to make so much of.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:27.420]   They said, "You think you're worshipping gods, you're worshipping nothing.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.660]   You are gods made of gold and silver and wood and stone.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.020]   They're the creatures of your own imagination, the projection of your own ideas.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.020]   They have no being.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.060]   You have to make them and you have to carry them about, put them on shelves and put them
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.060]   back.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   They're the gods, they're vanities."
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   That's what Paul had to say to those poor people in Lystra.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.700]   They were ready to make him into a god.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.180]   He says, "You don't know what a god is?"
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.500]   No, no, God is not like that.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.980]   And he had to tell them in Athens of all places where their city was cluttered up with temples
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.260]   to the various gods, "God dwelleth not in temples made with hens."
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.900]   "Your whole idea," he says, "is wrong."
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.860]   Stephen puts it here in a very pregnant phrase.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.540]   "Here are these people, you see, in Jerusalem, the temple and the Sanhedrin, proud of the
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.540]   temple and its worship."
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.380]   "Listen," said Stephen, "the God of glory appeared unto your father Abraham when he
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.380]   was in Mesopotamia."
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.700]   Leave alone in any part of Palestine, he was actually in Mesopotamia, not only not in Jerusalem
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.300]   but right outside your country, before he ever dwelt in Cairo.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.820]   Well now, there is the second thing.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.340]   He is a god who is the God of glory also in his purposes.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.460]   We don't understand them.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:45.700]   The prophet cries out, saying, "God says to the prophet, 'Rather my thoughts are not
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:52.460]   your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways,' saith the Lord."
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.420]   Oh, the infinite, eternal purposes of God.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.180]   It's a part of his glory.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.300]   So I go on to say this.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:07.460]   The God of glory is one who is entirely beyond men's mind and reason, entirely beyond men's
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.460]   searching.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:21.940]   The God of glory, he is incomprehensible, immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:31.180]   inaccessible, hidden from our eyes, most glorious, most perfect, the ancient of days, pavilion
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.940]   in splendor and girded with praise.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.140]   Good attempt, isn't it?
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.940]   But when you think of the reality, it's nothing.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.940]   We don't know.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.060]   He is incomprehensible.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.900]   The apostle Paul, you see, makes this point when he writes to people interested in philosophy
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:55.960]   at Corinth and other places, he says, "The world, by wisdom, knew not God."
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.980]   And this is the tragedy of modern men.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.540]   He thinks he's big enough to arrive at God and to understand God.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:10.220]   He thinks he can encompass the whole glory of God with his little mind, the fool, the
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:17.380]   fool, what else can you call him, trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:22.500]   The world had been trying by its wisdom to find God, but it couldn't do so.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.180]   Job would put the question, "Can a man, by searching, find out God?"
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.820]   And the answer is eternally, "No."
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.020]   Well, says someone to me, "Are you saying that there is no place whatsoever for reason?
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.940]   Is there no use whatsoever for understanding?"
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.860]   There is.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:46.060]   But the first thing we have to realize is the limit to reason and the limit to our understanding.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:50.980]   Now, the apostle Paul makes this point very clearly in his first chapter of his epistle
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.140]   to the Romans.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.720]   This is a part of the preaching of the gospel, remember.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.820]   He says, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:07.880]   of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God is
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.820]   manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:16.980]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:25.820]   by the things that are made, even his eternal power ungodded, so that they are without excuse.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:31.180]   Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:36.180]   became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened, professing themselves
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:43.940]   to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:49.540]   image made like to corruptible men, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.540]   things.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:56.940]   Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, and all the moral mess of that time in the
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.380]   world and of the present time in the history of the world."
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.820]   But all that, you see, just means this, the thing that Paul was saying there at Lystra
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.740]   in his address when they wanted to make a God of him, he said, "You know, I am not
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:14.180]   a God, there is only one God, and you ought to be believing in him, instead of worshipping
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.340]   Jupiter and Mars and Mercurius and all the rest of them, and adding us, if you like,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.340]   to your pantheon."
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.660]   "No, no," said Paul, "you don't know about God, but you have no excuse for your
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.820]   ignorance, he has left his marks behind him, he has given us rain and sun and fruitful
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.100]   seasons, why don't you see God in nature?"
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.900]   He says the same thing as Paul is saying here in this first chapter of his epistle to the
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.900]   Romans.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:45.660]   He said exactly the same thing in his address on Mars Hill in Athens, as you noticed.
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:50.560]   He said, "You know, it is God who has arranged all these things, the nations and their bounds
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.660]   of their habitations, and the times and the seasons, we are all in his hands, even some
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:01.380]   of your own poets have had a glimmering of it," he says, "we are all also his offspring,
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:06.740]   but you see, they couldn't get beyond this, the unknown God.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:12.380]   If men used his reason as he should, he would, through nature and creation, arrive at a belief
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:19.460]   in a powerful creator, in a mind behind the universe, the power of God, but he'll never
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.820]   get any further.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:29.260]   The highest, topmost reach of the philosophers is the unknown God.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:35.220]   Oh yes, they'd known, they'd discovered that there was someone, some great power behind
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.020]   all their various gods, but they couldn't find him.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.020]   They sought after him.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.780]   If happy, they might seek after him and find him, but they couldn't find him.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.940]   The world by wisdom knew not God, so they had to put up a temple with this inscription,
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.580]   to the unknown God, and all your thinking will never get beyond that.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.580]   Why?
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:43:00.620]   Because God is the God of glory, the glory of the one who dwells in a light which is
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.260]   unapproachable, whom no man hath ever seen or can see.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.820]   Very well, then, what is our position?
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:14.700]   Well, you see, it comes to this, and this is, we come still more directly to the gospel.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.460]   This is the thing we need, the knowledge of God.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.540]   But we can't arrive at it.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.700]   Do what we will, we can't.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:26.420]   There are many reasons for that, which I may give you in a subsequent Sunday evening.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.780]   Is there no hope for us, then?
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.780]   Gospel is good news.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.700]   Isn't there any message?
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.380]   There is a message.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:41.940]   Our only hope is this, is that God, the God of glory, should be pleased to reveal himself.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.660]   It's our only hope.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.380]   We'll never arrive at him.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.660]   Who can scale the heights?
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.700]   Who can come face to face with God?
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.940]   No man, impossible.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.340]   The only hope is that God should reveal himself to us.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.420]   And my dear friends, he has, and that's why I'm in this pulpit.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.940]   That's why there's a Christian message, that's why there's a gospel, that's why we have something
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   to preach.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:10.900]   God hath visited and redeemed his people, the God who acts, but he's revealed himself
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.900]   first.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.500]   How has he revealed himself?
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.780]   Well, I remind you again, he's revealed himself in creation and nature.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.460]   The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.900]   Look here, instead of trying to be clever about miracles, you go out and just look into
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.660]   the heavens and look at the stars.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:41.580]   Read Psalm 19, the heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament shows forth the wonder
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.800]   of his ways and of his praise.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.820]   That's what you need to look at.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.460]   Look up into the heavens and try and explain them if you can.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:56.980]   God has revealed himself partially through nature and creation.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:03.780]   But not only that, he's a God who has revealed himself in history, the God of our fathers,
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:11.900]   God of glory revealed himself unto our father, Abraham, God who reveals himself in history
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:17.220]   and in acts, read the Old Testament history, read about the building of the tabernacle
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.180]   and the temple, read about that innermost sanctum called the holiest of all, and you'll
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:29.060]   read about some Shekinah glory, a place into which men entered with fear.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:33.860]   When Moses had finished building the tabernacle, a cloud settled upon it, and Moses dared not
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.860]   enter in.
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.860]   Why?
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.220]   The glory of God filled the house.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:43.180]   This is a revelation of God in a material form.
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:48.620]   It's a mere representation, but it's a very vital one and a very important one.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.460]   Not only that, God reveals himself likewise in words.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:56.140]   He has given revelations of himself to men in action.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.380]   There are many examples and illustrations of this.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.300]   He gave one, a notable one, to Moses.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   He took Moses and put him on a rock.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.940]   He said, "You can't see me and live, but I'll give you a glimpse of my back parts, as it
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:09.940]   were."
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.620]   He put him there, took his hand off, and Moses looked and saw, and he heard this great word
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.620]   coming.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.620]   The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed, "The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:26.220]   suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.500]   and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.380]   of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, and to the third
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.020]   and to the fourth generation."
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:44.220]   And then he does it, you see, in providence.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:53.060]   The birds of the air, the lily of the valley, God's providence, everything sustained, harvest,
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.060]   thanksgiving.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.060]   Why?
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.540]   Well, it's God we've got to thank.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.660]   If God withdrew the sun and the rain and all these other factors, we'd have nothing to
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   eat.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.660]   We'd all die of starvation.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.660]   Providence.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.660]   Then look at him in prophecy.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:12.700]   What a wonderful revelation of God, giving men the ability 800 years before the time
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.860]   to write down in detail some of the things that would happen when his son would come
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.860]   into the world.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:18.860]   Prophecy.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.340]   What a revelation of the glory of God.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:26.820]   But then, you know, he has given sometimes an immediate revelation to certain chosen
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.980]   men of himself and of his glory.
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:33.740]   Here it is, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham."
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.380]   I'm going to elaborate that.
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:39.060]   I just mention it this evening.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.420]   But he gave Abraham a glimpse of his glory.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.820]   Abraham never doubted the being of God after that.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.580]   Do you remember the story of Jacob fleeing from his brother Esau?
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:55.020]   And at last, tired and weary, he says, "I must have some sleep."
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:59.260]   So he puts himself on the ground, picks a stone, puts his head on it for a pillow, and
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.900]   then he has the dream, the vision, the ladder coming down from heaven, and the angels of
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.740]   God descending and ascending.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:13.100]   And he awakes up in the morning, God is in this place, the glory of God, to Jacob.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   Moses.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.180]   Do you remember the story of Moses?
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:22.660]   He had to flee for his life from Egypt, and he becomes just an ordinary shepherd in the
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.660]   land of Midian.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:28.140]   And one afternoon, not expecting anything to happen, he takes the sheep to the back
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:33.620]   side of a mountain, and he'd done this sort of thing so often, but suddenly he's arrested
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:40.540]   by a flame in a bush, a flaming bush, and yet the bush wasn't consumed, and a voice
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:47.340]   comes out of the bush to him, the voice of God, the glory of God, the God of glory, revealing
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.340]   himself unto Moses at the burning bush.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:56.020]   Isaiah tells us that what makes him capable of writing his great prophecy is a vision
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.020]   of God.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:02.260]   Read the sixth chapter of the book of Isaiah, and it's a vision of glory, a vision of
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.260]   wonder.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.140]   God has revealed himself in these various ways.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.140]   What is the revelation?
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:11.660]   Well, it's this, you see, he's a personal God.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:16.060]   He's the God who said to Moses, "I am that I am."
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:21.820]   "You tell me," said Moses to God, "to go to Egypt, and to say certain things to my
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.760]   own people, and then to Pharaoh, and then they'll ask me, 'What's your authority
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   for saying this?
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.380]   Who sent you with this message?'"
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:35.460]   You go to them, said God to Moses, and say, "I am, hath sent me.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:41.120]   I am that I am, the God of glory.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:50.220]   I am personal, not the ground of the universe or the ground of being, not love as an idea,
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:58.540]   but a personal God, a living God, unlike the gods of the pagans, made of wood and men's
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:05.780]   device, and stone and silver, the Venetians, no, no, not the creation of your modern philosophers
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:12.700]   with all their cleverness and dialectic, a personal God outside us, above us, there in
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:22.460]   the unknown, God of glory, a God of holiness, a God of righteousness, a God of justice.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:28.660]   That's how he has revealed himself, and we know nothing about him apart from his own
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.660]   revelation.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:34.820]   And finally, he has told us that he is the judge of all the earth.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.300]   He has been revealing that from the very beginning.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.180]   He began doing it a way back in the Garden of Eden.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.460]   Paul was preaching it there in Athens.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:48.060]   It's continuous right through ever since, the God who is going to judge the whole world
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:53.660]   in righteousness, for he made it and it belongs to him, and he has a right to it, and we're
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.700]   all his creatures, and we'll all have to stand before him and give an account of what
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.780]   we've done with the amazing gifts that he has given us.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.940]   That's the God, the God of glory.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:16.380]   Oh, you remember, don't you, the famous story about Blaise Pascal, that mighty genius, that
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:21.500]   Frenchman, the most brilliant mathematician conceivably that's ever lived.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:28.260]   He lived 300 years ago, the brilliant thinker, the brilliant philosopher.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:33.140]   But you remember he tells us, and they found the statement folded up on a bit of paper
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:41.060]   and sewn onto his shirt, that when he died, God appeared to him one night, and he puts
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:47.340]   down on paper, glory, glory, glory.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:54.900]   The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, not the God of the philosophers.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.860]   It's Pascal who says that.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.940]   It's a part of it.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:06.660]   Once he'd had this glimpse, this vision, the God of the philosophers is of harm to him.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.660]   It's insulting.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   It's arrogant.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   They know nothing.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.660]   They're incapable.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:19.060]   The God of glory, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, not of the
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.060]   philosophers.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.920]   My dear friends, this is the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:28.100]   You see, this God who has made the universe and everything that is in it, the God who
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.780]   controls everything, the God who will judge everything.
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.780]   Now then, here is the question I put to you.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.680]   Do you start with that God?
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.180]   Is that the starting point in all your thinking?
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.200]   You won't understand yourself.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.860]   You won't understand the modern world, the twentieth century, the modern men, and all
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.220]   these problems, until you go right back there.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:59.840]   God, who made the very world you're in, made you the God of history, here is the God of
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   glory.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.140]   Now then, I leave you with this final question this evening.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.060]   Have you met him?
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.300]   Oh, I contest you, not a matter of opinion.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:17.140]   There is an invariable reaction when people meet this God, the God of glory.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.140]   They stop arguing.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.140]   They stop being clever.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:23.380]   You remember what happened to Adam and Eve when they heard his voice in the garden in
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.380]   the cool of the evening?
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.100]   They went to hide behind the tree.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:34.420]   They're afraid the God of glory has come down to speak to them.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.420]   You remember Jacob.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.700]   Again, I take you back to that great incident at Peniel.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:45.660]   Jacob awakes up in the morning, and this is what he says, "Oh, go through this history."
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:50.940]   And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.420]   I knew it not."
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:58.060]   And he was afraid and said, "How dreadful is this place.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.740]   This is none other but the house of God.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:04.000]   This is the gate of heaven."
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.540]   Have you ever felt like that?
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:10.860]   Have you ever felt afraid, afraid of the living God?
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.860]   You've argued about him.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:12.860]   You've said things about him.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   You've criticized him.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.500]   You've shown your cleverness with respect to him.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.460]   It's all because you don't know him.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.460]   You know nothing about him.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.460]   You're ignorant.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.460]   You're blind.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.780]   You don't know the glory.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:32.260]   When you come anywhere near him, you feel how dreadful is this place.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.660]   You remember Moses again at the burning bush.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:39.420]   At first, you see a phenomenon for him to investigate in a scientific manner.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:46.260]   The voice comes to him, "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.900]   standest is holy ground."
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.100]   Have you ever felt that?
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:56.300]   This is the beginning of the Gospel, the awe, the reverence, the fear in the presence of
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   the living God.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.060]   Do you remember the story of Job?
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.060]   Poor Job.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.060]   It's a long book.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.060]   It's a fascinating book.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.060]   Go and read it for yourselves.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:08.900]   Listen to the things Job says about God, how he gives his opinion, thinks God is unfair,
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.220]   says this, that, and the other, but listen to it.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.980]   This is the end of the story.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.940]   Then Job answered the Lord and said, "Behold, I am vile.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.100]   What shall I answer thee?
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.940]   I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:26.420]   Once have I spoken, but I will not answer, yet twice, but I will proceed no further."
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.500]   Of course not.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   Why not?
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   Well, this is it.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.860]   Job expounds it himself in the 22nd chapter.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:39.940]   Job, 42nd chapter, Job answered the Lord and said, "I know that thou canst do everything
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.500]   and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.500]   Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.740]   Therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me, which I knew
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:51.740]   not.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.100]   Here I beseech thee and I will speak.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.260]   I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:04.860]   I have heard of thee by the hearing of the earth, but none mine eyes seeth thee.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:11.940]   Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes."
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.900]   Have you ever done that?
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.300]   That's the thing for you to face.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.340]   You've talked about God like Job did.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.380]   Have you reached the point of putting your hand upon your mouth?
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.180]   Have you repented in dust and ashes?
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.060]   Read about the reaction of Isaiah to the same thing.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:34.020]   "Woe is unto me, I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.340]   Who shall dwell with a burning fire?
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:41.100]   Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall dwell in his holy place?"
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.060]   Back comes an answer, "Be still and know that I am God."
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:51.900]   Or think of John the Evangelist in the book of Revelation.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:57.940]   He has the glimpse, and this is what he says, "I fell down as one dead."
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.620]   Of course he did.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.620]   Why?
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.460]   "For our God is a consuming fire."
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:14.220]   Ah, my dear friend, that's the reaction to men who have had some vague glimpse or understanding
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.180]   of the God of glory.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.500]   "I am vile.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.500]   I am unclean.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   I am undone."
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.700]   They repent in dust and ashes.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:29.060]   They feel they're worthy of nothing but damnation, to be hurled out of His sight forever.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.860]   That is the result of the revelation of the glory of God.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:36.340]   But, thank God, it doesn't stop there.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:43.100]   There is a further revelation of God, which is the good news of the gospel this evening.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:48.620]   God has revealed Himself in those ways, but finally He has revealed Himself in His only
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:51.300]   begotten Son, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:56.580]   "And we beheld His glory," says John, "the glories of the only begotten of the Father,
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.820]   full of grace and truth."
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.100]   This Jesus says, "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:06.900]   "God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,"
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:12.660]   says Paul, "to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.660]   Christ."
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:19.540]   Oh, the blessing of this revelation, the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.540]   I am crushed.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.540]   I am undone.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.540]   I am condemned.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.540]   I am vile.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:31.700]   But here is one who is God Himself, the Son, who says, "Come unto me, all ye that weary
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:37.700]   and are heavy laden, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:41.500]   Or have you ever offered this prayer with Augustus Toplady?
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:51.140]   "While I draw this fleeting breath, when mine eyes shall close in death," it will happen
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.140]   to you.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:59:03.820]   "When I soar through tracts unknown, see thee on thy judgment throne, rock of ages
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:10.480]   cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee."
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.580]   If you have had any glimpse of the God of glory, you will realize that your only hope
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:20.500]   is in the rock of ages, the Son of God, cleft for you.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:28.460]   Have you ever pled with Him, "Let me hide myself in thee"?
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:36.820]   He is ready and willing and waiting to receive all who cry out unto Him in penitence and
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:47.460]   contrition, and in the depth of their human despair, "Cry unto Him, and He will hear you."
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.660]   Amen.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:53.580]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
