[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   How do you suggest parents deal with retorts and rudeness?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   And again, let's extend this to all relationships.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.840]   So you get in your best mindset,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.940]   and by the way, I love this I am thing.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.360]   Two of the most important words in any language
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.960]   when translated to other languages.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.640]   I am blank, I am a good this,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.500]   or I am whatever role identity is key to the brain.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   We know this.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.820]   You go in and you say, I'm really sorry.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.780]   I struggle to regulate my emotions.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.580]   I believe that you're really upset.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.280]   And the kid says, I hate you.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.180]   Now, earlier you said that good boundaries
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.860]   are about not expecting a change in behavior
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740]   from someone else, they're about our own boundaries.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.660]   So, or maybe the I hate you comes from,
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.080]   listen, we're not gonna go to so-and-so's house
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.060]   for a play date today.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.100]   - Great example, I hate you.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.940]   - I hate you.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.820]   So is there ever a case for no response?
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.620]   - I mean, to me, the most underutilized parenting strategy
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.340]   is doing nothing, literally.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.320]   It's one of my most used strategies,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.500]   'cause there's like really good reason for it,
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.740]   especially in this situation.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.060]   So I always, to me, I would say we have to understand
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.020]   before we intervene.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.940]   So I know every parent's like,
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.220]   what do you do in that situation?
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.060]   But it's like trying to fix someone's tennis swing
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.420]   before you look at their tennis swing.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.440]   There could be a lot of problems.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.240]   So again, why is a kid saying I hate you?
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.520]   And I would ask every parent to just keep this in mind.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.700]   It's a tool, and you can't use it in real time.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.560]   Eventually you can, but we have to say it
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.440]   at the end of the night.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.220]   When my kid said I hate you,
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.540]   what is my most generous interpretation
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.460]   of why he would say that to me?
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.380]   And if you're like any human, me included, by the way,
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.580]   like your least generous interpretation is immediate.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.820]   You're like, because he's a sociopath.
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.340]   Like that's what we say all the time.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340]   We're like, wow, or because he's like a horrible kid,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.120]   'cause he's spoiled, 'cause he's nasty.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.140]   It comes easily, so that's fine.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.700]   But what is my most generous interpretation?
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.620]   And when I don't know, I'll push myself to say,
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.860]   okay, well, like I was in a situation with my husband.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.120]   What would lead me to say that?
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.380]   I don't know, what would lead you to say that to someone?
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.220]   - That I hate them?
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740]   - Yeah, like they say something to you like,
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.420]   hey, Andrew, we're not gonna be able to do this dinner.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.660]   - It would have to be some sort of deep betrayal of trust.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.340]   And I have to acknowledge that if I said that to somebody
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.260]   that I really care about or love,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.500]   as I'm saying I hate you,
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.940]   what I'm really saying is I love you so much,
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.860]   and that hurts unbelievably at such an unbelievable
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.820]   intensity that what's coming out of my mouth says,
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.540]   I hate you, because if you didn't love them.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.380]   - That's right.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.380]   - It would have no effect.
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.660]   It would be a meh, it would be a meh,
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.140]   but instead it's a, ugh, it hurts.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.180]   So we somehow there's a neural circuit in there that goes,
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.900]   you know, I whatever, insert expletive, hate you.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.740]   - That's right.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.720]   - But what you're really saying is I love you so much.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   - Yeah.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.660]   - And as a consequence, that thing you did or said
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.220]   hurts so much.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.300]   - That's right.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.740]   And so I think that's like exactly what's going on
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.580]   for a kid.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.020]   Or like, to me, my most generous interpretation
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020]   in a simple way is my kid,
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.260]   when I said we couldn't go to this friend's house
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.660]   that he thought we were going to,
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.120]   his friend he was gonna sleep over,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.820]   he had like so built it up in his mind.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.900]   He'd like, probably like kids do,
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   like they have this whole image.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.140]   Oh, and then we're gonna do this and this.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.180]   And like the letdown was so intense.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.060]   And again, I go back to kids have all the feelings we have
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.580]   and they're born with none of the skills.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.260]   So it takes a lot of,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.980]   it takes like a pretty well-developed skill
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.460]   to be really disappointed, by the way,
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.820]   and surprised, right, in the moment,
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.780]   and like manage it in like a mature way.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.220]   I'm sure we both know adults
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.260]   who aren't really capable of doing that, right?
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.000]   So the fact that my seven-year-old is doing that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.180]   So if I think about it that way,
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.980]   we latch onto our kids' words as if they're the truth.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.980]   They're not the truth.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.280]   It's not to say they don't matter,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.700]   but they're not the truth.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.020]   The truth is whatever world is under the words.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.980]   Like I'm disappointed and I don't know how to manage that.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.260]   So if I think about the outcome,
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.740]   like where do I wanna be?
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.940]   What I would love in that situation.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.300]   'Cause the truth is when I say to my kid,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.260]   sorry, we can't go to Bobby's house.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.100]   I wouldn't even want,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.560]   it's not normal for my kid to be like, oh, no problem.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.140]   Because like, I'm just picturing my 25-year-old
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.780]   like trying to get a job and being like,
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.100]   mom, oh, I didn't get it.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.380]   And then he's like, no problem.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.620]   I'm like, that's kind of weird.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.440]   Like, really?
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.280]   Like, that's weird.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.440]   I'd want you to be disappointed.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.560]   And so what I want my kid to be able to do
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.400]   is to be like, I don't know, what's the best to get?
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.040]   It's like, oh man, I was really looking forward to that.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.660]   That's like ultimate maturity.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.840]   So how do I get from I hate you
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.860]   to, oh man, I was really like, you know,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.680]   looking forward to that.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.560]   All the things we wanna do just like don't even make sense.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.880]   Like sending my kid to their room saying like,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.880]   you're such a nasty kid.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.320]   I've never seen any of your friends
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.440]   say that to their parents.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.000]   And I'm good at acting these things out.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.960]   Because of course, I say these things too.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.400]   But all I'm doing is basically telling my kid
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.840]   the version of themselves I don't want them to be.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.280]   So now I'm further away from that outcome.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.540]   Just not effective.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.880]   My kid obviously literally needs to learn
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.800]   some of those skills and practice them.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.880]   We don't think about simulations with kids nearly enough.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.320]   We know that in sports.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.680]   People practice all the time.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.400]   We don't do that with emotion regulation.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.560]   So what do I do in the moment?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.520]   I think the best question here is
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.120]   what do I do outside the moment
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.640]   to help my kid build the skills
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.440]   so they actually have more of a skill
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.040]   the next time that moment comes?
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.200]   Still, I'm a pragmatist.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.020]   What do I do in the moment?
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.860]   I hate you.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.560]   I probably would do nothing first.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.600]   When someone is rude to you
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.080]   and they say something nasty,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.400]   I don't know, I just like this is one,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.480]   this is my son, this is me.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.400]   My son just hurled I hate you.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's like sitting between us.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   When we say back to them like, you know,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.960]   I hate you or like go to your room.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   We take all the energy from what they said
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.120]   and we just like throw it.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.840]   And then like we have this ping pong match.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.080]   When you do nothing,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.320]   I always picture if this is like I hate you,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.500]   it just sits between us.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.440]   My kid has a much higher chance
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.760]   of kind of reowning what they just said
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.640]   because I'm just kind of sturdy in that moment
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.760]   because I didn't just take it from them
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.920]   and say something to them,
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.360]   which just gives them the opportunity
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.720]   to like take what I said
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.560]   and have no responsibility for the first thing they said.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.680]   It's always true in adults.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.560]   When someone says to you like something nasty,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.460]   if you actually just stay there,
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.040]   they're kind of like, oh, shoot.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.280]   Like I shouldn't have said that
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.960]   because like it's right there.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.100]   So I'd probably say nothing.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.400]   Now, a couple, I don't know if I'd really do that,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.360]   but I'd want to do that.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.640]   Let me be clear.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.120]   Something else you can say in that moment,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.240]   which takes a lot of presence
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.280]   so it's not gonna happen right away,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.460]   is just something like, whoa.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.760]   Like clearly you're disappointed.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.000]   I get that.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.480]   I believe you.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.120]   And I know there's another way you can say that to me.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   That's actually right back to family jobs.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.200]   I'm validating and I'm setting kind of a boundary
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.020]   in some ways.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.480]   Like I know maybe there's a hope there too.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.720]   Like I know there's another way.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.840]   If my kid keeps saying, I hate you, I hate you.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.040]   You're the worst, you're the worst.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.240]   I'm gonna say, listen, I love you.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.080]   You're a good kid.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.360]   You're having a hard time.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.080]   I really won't stay in your room
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.140]   while you keep saying this to me.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.860]   And part of that is 'cause it's not good for you either.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.040]   Like this isn't a good dynamic.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   I'm gonna step outside.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.880]   I'm gonna come back.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.020]   And we can talk about it when we're both in a place
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.240]   where we can be a little more respectful
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.520]   or something like that, right?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.320]   I don't have to be a punching bag.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.920]   But at least now I'm helping my kid see
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.680]   that he is having a feeling under these words.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   If I can't differentiate the feeling from the behavior,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.680]   how can I expect my kid to ever learn
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.340]   to differentiate those two?
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.520]   Which is how my kid can actually get
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.320]   to a more regulated place.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.160]   - Thank you for tuning in
