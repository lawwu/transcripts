[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Now let's talk about some protocols
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.860]   that involve changing the chemistry of your mouth,
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.880]   not just immediately after meals
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.900]   or during brushing or flossing,
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.140]   but really around the clock.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.500]   And one of the key protocols that I'd like to discuss
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.440]   is the use of an artificial sugar called xylitol.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.120]   Xylitol is a very low calorie sweetener.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.440]   I can place it among the other low calorie sweeteners
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.020]   like aspartame, sucralose, stevia, et cetera.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.160]   But what's unique about xylitol
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.520]   is that very much like standard sugar
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.720]   or any kind of carbohydrate sugar,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   the bacteria Streptococcus mutans loves to eat xylitol.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.720]   But when Streptococcus mutans eats xylitol,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.200]   it doesn't, meaning it cannot produce the acid
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.840]   that normally would demineralize the teeth
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   and create cavities.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.360]   In addition to that,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.080]   when Streptococcus mutans eats xylitol,
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.380]   it kills Streptococcus mutans.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.720]   So what this means is that if xylitol is present
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.620]   in the oral cavity after a meal,
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.980]   say in the minutes and hours after a meal,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.740]   then any Streptococcus mutans that happens to be there
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.260]   is going to preferentially feed on the xylitol,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.780]   not other sugars, and it won't be able to release acid.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.220]   And because xylitol can actually inhibit the growth,
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.240]   and that is the proliferation of more Streptococcus mutans,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   we've got a twofer.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.020]   We've got a situation where Streptococcus mutans
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.640]   can't release acid to demineralize the teeth
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.160]   and potentially cause cavities,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   and the total amount of Streptococcus mutans that can grow,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.160]   that can proliferate in what are called colonies,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.440]   literally the bacteria colonizes on the teeth
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.360]   and that forming that biofilm,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.040]   well, then that can't happen.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.820]   So xylitol is a very potent tool
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.160]   for improving oral health in this way.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.400]   In addition, xylitol reduces inflammation of the gum tissue
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   and other soft tissues of the mouth.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.900]   And so xylitol is providing an array of positive benefits,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.720]   especially when it's present to the mouth
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.220]   immediately after meals.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.340]   And for that reason,
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.500]   there are a number of different dentists
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.960]   that have created xylitol products in the form of gums
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.620]   or in the form of mints,
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.840]   specifically to be used after meals.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.280]   So by chewing a few of these xylitol mints,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   or by chewing a xylitol-based gum immediately after a meal,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.320]   you're taking substantial steps
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.080]   towards improving the chemical milieu of your mouth
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.960]   and inhibiting the proliferation
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.780]   of cavity-forming Streptococcus mutans.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.360]   Now, you can also find some literature
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.320]   on other proposed benefits of xylitol,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.480]   such as improving overall microbiome,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.880]   such as reducing inflammation in other tissues
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.360]   besides the gums and within the mouth.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.200]   There is some evidence
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.440]   that it can support the gut microbiome
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.000]   because, of course, the oral microbiome
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.720]   and the gut microbiome are contiguous.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.840]   They have different compartments.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.620]   I mean, you might even be surprised to learn
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.080]   that within your mouth,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.160]   there are different niches, as they're called.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.200]   For instance, there's different microbiota
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.340]   that live on the gums versus the hard palate
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.900]   versus the soft palate back in the throat,
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500]   and then as you descend into the gut, et cetera.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.940]   And it does appear that xylitol
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.700]   has certain positive benefits
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.620]   for all of those different gut microbiome niches.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.900]   But the literature on that is less well-substantiated
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.180]   than, for instance, the literature showing
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.900]   that if xylitol is put in as a surrogate sugar substrate
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.660]   for Strep mutans, that it disables Strep mutans
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.040]   and can prevent the formation of cavities.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.940]   Now, as far as I know,
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.020]   when consumed in mint form or gum form,
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.540]   I'm not aware of any specific side effects
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.980]   or bad effects of xylitol,
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.580]   provided that it's not consumed in excess.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.140]   But as with everything, dosage matters.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.020]   So if you're somebody who wants to explore
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.180]   the use of xylitol gum or xylitol mints after a meal,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.980]   I wouldn't suggest going from consuming zero xylitol mints
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.420]   to consuming 50 a day or something like that,
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.260]   or even 10 a day.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.360]   You might start off slowly
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.500]   and just consume one or two after a meal,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.580]   maybe just your morning meal,
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.460]   maybe just your evening meal,
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.660]   something of that sort,
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.500]   rather than chewing xylitol gum all day long,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.580]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.340]   I'll just mention one other positive benefit
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.740]   of xylitol gum,
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.740]   which is if you use xylitol gum after, say,
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.100]   your noon meal or your early day meal,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.740]   it further increases the production of saliva,
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.940]   which, as we talked about before, is a great thing
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.620]   because one of the best ways to support oral health
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.060]   and tooth health is to have a long stretch of time
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.140]   in the middle of the day
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.280]   where you're producing a lot of healthy saliva
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.500]   in large amounts, because again,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.900]   saliva is this incredible stuff
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.340]   that's supporting remineralization of the teeth.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.420]   So lots and lots of reasons to think about,
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.880]   maybe consider using xylitol gum or xylitol mints.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.860]   There are a number of different ones available out there.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.980]   I have zero, again, zero financial relationship
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.620]   to any of those mint or gum companies.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.360]   I'll provide a link in the show note captions
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.020]   to one source.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.660]   The company and the products were developed by a dentist,
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.580]   Dr. Ellie Phillips,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.480]   who is quite prominent in the public health education space
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.400]   around dental health.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.600]   Some of her views are a little bit controversial,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.040]   like her views on flossing.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.160]   Other of her views,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.280]   I find, frankly, quite ahead of their time
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.120]   in that she's been talking about a number of these things
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.320]   like promoting the health of the oral microbiome
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.640]   and the potential value of xylitol gums and mints, et cetera,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.040]   for some period of time.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.480]   I think most of the information that she puts out there
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.080]   is supported by other dentists,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.040]   and she still suggests regular dental visits.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.680]   So, you know, nothing renegade out there or heretical.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.220]   Again, there are other sources of xylitol gums and mints
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.320]   that you could consider.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.580]   I'm simply putting a link to the one that I use
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.680]   because I happen to use them and like them.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.820]   So I'd like to use the discussion about xylitol
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.380]   as a segue into a discussion about toothpaste,
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.480]   because there is a lot of controversy out there
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.080]   about which toothpaste are better for us,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.480]   maybe even bad for us, and best for us.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   I think it's fair to say,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.320]   based on what we all now know about xylitol,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.040]   that if you can find a toothpaste
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.180]   that contains xylitol as a sweetener,
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.960]   that can only be a good thing.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.840]   And indeed, there are a number of them out there.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   We'll talk about specific sources in a little bit,
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.400]   but let's just put xylitol on the short
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.680]   to not so short list of things
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.720]   that would be great to have in a toothpaste
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.520]   for all the reasons that you now understand.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.920]   The real big question with toothpaste is always,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.680]   should I use a toothpaste that has fluoride
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   or avoid toothpastes that have fluoride?
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.140]   And in order to answer that,
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.280]   we have to go back to our earlier discussion about fluoride.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   It really depends on whether or not you're somebody
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.840]   that thinks that fluoride is great
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.240]   because it creates these super physiologically strong bonds
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.080]   within our teeth.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.000]   The crystal structures are that much stronger
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.080]   than when formed by hydroxyapatite,
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.680]   or whether or not you're somebody who is wary of fluoride,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.960]   that you're concerned about potential brain health issues
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.000]   or thyroid issues.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.040]   And here, I think people really do fall into either camp
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.880]   or the camp, frankly, of, I don't know, should I be worried?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.320]   I don't know if I should be worried.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.740]   I personally grew up using fluoride toothpaste.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.200]   We had the kind of standard name brand fluoride toothpaste
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.120]   in our bathroom.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.000]   I brushed my teeth with those for years.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.400]   Whether or not that negatively impacted my health or not,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.080]   I don't know.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.000]   Get my blood work done.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.460]   My thyroid hormones are normal.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.080]   My brain works at least reasonably well.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.340]   But I do realize that some people
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.760]   are very concerned about fluoride
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.240]   and they just don't want it anywhere near their kids.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.560]   They don't want it anywhere near themselves.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.740]   So if you're somebody who's going to err
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.400]   on the side of caution with fluoride
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   and you are seeking a non-fluoride containing toothpaste,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.460]   there are such toothpastes out there.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.160]   And most of those, if not all of them, contain,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160]   you guessed it, hydroxyapatite.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.880]   They contain the minerals that naturally form the bonds
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.320]   that create that additional enamel
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.640]   that can potentially fill in cavities
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.920]   by remineralization of the enamel
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.840]   and some of the deeper layers of the tooth.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.720]   So if one is seeking toothpaste
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.560]   and you want to avoid fluoride,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.980]   you'd want to find something that ideally
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.980]   had hydroxyapatite and something that had xylitol.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.820]   And they often also contain some sort of mild abrasive.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.920]   Okay, not a really scratchy abrasive substance,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.140]   but a mild abrasive that can really allow
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.660]   for breaking up with the biofilm
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.260]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.380]   Now I've provided links to a couple of sources
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.020]   for such toothpaste and also
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.540]   for these little toothpaste tablets
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.100]   that I've been using lately as well.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.860]   I sometimes switch back and forth between the two.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.760]   These are tablets that you chew up
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.200]   and then you brush your teeth immediately after
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.440]   with your wet toothbrush.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.000]   Both of them work quite well.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680]   Again, I want to be clear that the companies
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.720]   that I've provided links to in the show note captions
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.120]   are companies for which I have
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.380]   absolutely zero financial relationship.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.100]   I do know some of the people that started these companies.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.420]   I actually discovered these companies
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.360]   because these people are dentists or periodontists
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.320]   or other people in the oral health field.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.520]   But I also want to be very clear
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.620]   that there was no exchange of promotion
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.940]   of their products for information or otherwise.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.440]   I simply tried and liked the products
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.400]   and I just so happened to have learned some things
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.880]   about oral health care from these people,
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.780]   separate and away from anything about toothpaste
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.540]   or xylitols, et cetera, okay?
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.200]   So I want to be very clear
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.120]   that I do believe these are quality sources.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.800]   These are the toothpaste and tooth tablets
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.200]   that I happen to use, gums and mints that I happen to use,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.280]   large part as a consequence of researching this episode,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.920]   but I pay full price for them.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.620]   I'm certainly not suggesting that anyone else
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.900]   has to use them.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.020]   They just represent one option
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.420]   if you're looking for non-fluoride containing toothpaste
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.460]   and some other things to promote oral health.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.380]   And I'm sure there are other sources out there.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.100]   And if you'd like to refer the various viewers
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.780]   and listeners of this podcast to those sources,
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.940]   'cause you feel very strongly about those other sources,
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.020]   just put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.600]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.880]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.460]   (upbeat music)
