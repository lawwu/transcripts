[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.240]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.840]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.240]   where I try to help you achieve financial freedom sooner
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240]   rather than later and figure out all that's
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.580]   going on that highly matters in the personal finance world.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.240]   In this solo episode, I want to talk
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.280]   about why every residential real estate
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.800]   investor is suddenly richer, how much real estate commissions
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.520]   will come down, and also a win-win scenario where
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.720]   the seller, the prospective buyer, the listing agent,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.920]   and the buyer's agent will all benefit from a life
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.480]   post the National Association of Realtors settlement.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.800]   Now, given the settlement, $418 million on March 15, 2024,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.920]   after the judgment, I think, was in November 2023
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.040]   for $1.8 billion plus treble damages that could lead up
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   to like $3 plus billion.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.680]   This is great news for home sellers,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.920]   for residential real estate investors and owners
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   specifically.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.000]   Why is that?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420]   Well, they were the ones burdened
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.240]   with paying the so-called, quote, "standard real estate
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.420]   commission," ranging from 5% to 6%.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.240]   And now, after the settlement, real estate commissions
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.040]   should fall between 1% to 4% immediately.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.080]   Well, maybe not immediately, immediately,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.680]   but definitely within the next six months,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.000]   definitely by the end of 2024 or 2025.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.440]   Already, before this settlement happened on March 15,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.800]   I had negotiated 3.5% from a veteran husband-wife couple
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.560]   who has been selling Westside San Francisco real estate
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.640]   for over 10 years.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.480]   They agreed to 3.5%, and they agreed to accept 1.5%
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.000]   and pay the buyer's agent 2%, which I actually
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.280]   thought was unfair, because they were going to be doing
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.920]   a lot more of the work.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.160]   And I told them that.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.080]   And so they said, well, if you want to lower it to 2%,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.040]   that's OK.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.400]   I didn't think that was right.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.120]   And they did say, well, if you want
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.000]   us to lower it to 1.5% for the buyer's agent, that's OK too.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.860]   And if that's the case, my total commission expense
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.680]   would be 3%.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.440]   But they were very, very, very hesitant on doing that.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480]   And that shows the power of luring in buyer's agents
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   with higher commission payouts.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.200]   And this is called steering, which is not
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.640]   looked positively upon by people in the industry.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.400]   Now, ultimately, I didn't end up going with them,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   because I just want to own this awesome panoramic ocean view
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.000]   home in San Francisco's Westside,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.160]   because I think we're at the beginning of another strong
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.400]   real estate upcycle in the city because of big technology
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   and as well as artificial intelligence.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.320]   I've seen this movie before.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.920]   I saw when Google and Facebook went public.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.280]   And it really pushed up San Francisco Bay Area real estate
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.100]   prices.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.480]   And I think this is going to happen for the next 10 to 20
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.200]   years as well.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.600]   So I decided to hold on.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.080]   Well, what happens when real estate commissions go down?
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   That means home sellers get to keep 1, 2,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.720]   eventually perhaps up to 6% of the value of their homes,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440]   because that's how much real estate commissions will
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.160]   come down.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.840]   So if it comes down by 1% to 4% on average over the next 12
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.160]   months, that is how much boost--
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.320]   that is the boost in value of everyone's real estate
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.000]   holdings in residential.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.960]   So for example, if you own a million dollars
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.240]   worth of property, real estate commissions go down 1%.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   That's $10,000 boost.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.840]   If it goes down 4%, that's $40,000.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.160]   And maybe in 10, 20 years when technology and AI automates
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.200]   real estate buying and selling, maybe that transaction cost
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.720]   will go down from 5%, 6% to 0% or 0.1%.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.840]   After all, if you look at the online brokerage rate
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.680]   commissions, they have all gone down to $0.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   And they are operating just fine.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.200]   Heck, look at Robinhood.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.120]   Robinhood is up like 80-plus percent from its bottom
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.800]   in 2022.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.280]   And it doesn't charge anything.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.760]   So this is how everyone has to think
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.680]   who owns residential real estate.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.720]   Your value just got a nice, at minimum 1%,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.480]   and probably up to 4% boost in value over the next 12 months.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.620]   So if you're thinking about selling,
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.480]   I would wait because it will take some time for real estate
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.840]   commissions to come down.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.040]   Although I just said I negotiated 3.5% myself
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.000]   in January 2024 before the settlement,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.960]   but after the verdict that occurred in November 2023.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.440]   Overall, in general, the ideal length of time
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.200]   to own real estate is forever.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.720]   It's just the same thing with stocks.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.000]   The ideal length of time to own stocks, the S&P 500
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.960]   specifically, is forever.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.520]   But with stocks, unfortunately, you can't enjoy your stocks.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.800]   There's no utility in stocks.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.280]   With real estate, at least, it's tangible.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.040]   You can see it.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.840]   You can live in it.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   You can enjoy it.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.520]   Even if you don't plan to sell any of your real estate
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   holdings, your residential real estate holdings,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.520]   you also have a boost of 1% to 4%
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.320]   immediately with the value when you calculate your net worth.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.040]   Net worth is somewhat of an amorphous subjective
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.320]   calculation.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.200]   How much is a private business or a private equity
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.600]   stake really worth?
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.920]   You don't really know, so you've got to just kind of guess
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.080]   and come up with best-guessed estimate.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.200]   But in real estate, it's kind of the same thing.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.840]   You can think your real estate is worth x,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   but it might be worth x minus 10% or plus 5% or 10%
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.280]   if you go out to the market.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.840]   However, for your books, for your personal private books,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.360]   net worth calculation, you can boost your real estate holdings
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   by 1% to 4% because of real estate commissions declining.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.760]   And here's the thing, folks.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.000]   Do not take offense to this change
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.080]   in the structure of real estate commissions.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.720]   The only people really complaining,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.640]   the only people commenting on Financial Samurai, for example,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.120]   who are upset about this, are real estate agents.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.640]   And I understand this.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.240]   And the reason why is because buying agents
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.520]   will probably earn less money.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.200]   And selling agents, maybe they'll earn less money, too.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.520]   But not necessarily, because when you cut prices,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.240]   volume tends to go up.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.720]   It's the elasticity of demand.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.800]   And so in this case, maybe there might be more real estate
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.520]   transactions.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.760]   Because think about all the people who've
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   been sitting on the sidelines.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.920]   They don't want to pay the 5% to 6% commission rate.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.880]   And they're finally seeing the news saying, oh, a judge
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.760]   and the jury of our peers said this
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.840]   is price fixing and collusion.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.720]   And therefore, real estate prices
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.560]   are going to face market rates, market pressure.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.040]   This ruling is not an indictment on the hardworking and honest
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.200]   real estate agents out there who are just
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.920]   trying to make a living.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.040]   This is not personal.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.120]   This is business.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.200]   The ruling was against letting the markets do their job.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.960]   Think about how the markets did their job
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.240]   with practically every single industry
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.880]   that faces competition.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.240]   It has pushed commission rates down.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.320]   This is one of the reasons why I left the equities
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.240]   business in 2012.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.200]   It seemed very clear to me that commission rates in trading
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   were going to go down because algorithmic and electronic
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.840]   trading, which it has.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.380]   And now a lot of the trades are free.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.640]   So for institutional equities, you can really only make money.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.480]   Maybe, well, you can make money on research.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.720]   You can make money on block trading.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.460]   But those commission rates have come down,
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.320]   so compensation has come down.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.360]   And that's just the way free markets work.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.960]   So the ruling is trying to fix the free markets not working
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.780]   in real estate commissions, which
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.800]   have stayed sticky for decades, while every other industry
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.540]   that I can think of has seen commission rates go down.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.380]   So I do want to highlight a way for buyer's agents
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.860]   to make money.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.780]   And the one thing I think is very important
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.100]   is that all buyer's agents will now
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.140]   be required for their clients to sign a contract
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.660]   to be able to work with them.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.500]   Because it's unfair.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.580]   It's unfair for prospective buyers
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.780]   to use a buyer's agent for 20 showings
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.980]   and submit offers for five properties, not succeed.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.540]   And then the buyer agent never gets
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.580]   paid for any of the work that they've done.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.660]   That's really not fair.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.580]   We should compensate buyer's agents accordingly.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.780]   And the market will dictate that.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.940]   And so what I think will happen is
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.060]   there's going to be clear contracts.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.380]   And in the contracts, it'll highlight exactly what
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.580]   the buyer's agent will do.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.620]   And I have this in a post.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.460]   It's a really nice, simple graphic.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.180]   Has a nice fee schedule.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.180]   Client onboarding, $200.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.860]   Draft and submit offer, $500.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.380]   And $100 for every additional offer.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.500]   $100, open escrow with title and begin escrow process.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.420]   $100, schedule and coordinate home inspection.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.940]   $250, review homes, inspection, and draft buyer response.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.260]   $25 to process all amendments and addendums.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.180]   This is per addendum.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.020]   $250, review closing statement and finalize transaction.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.140]   $200, buyer final walkthrough.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.260]   $400, transaction brokerage insurance due at closing.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.940]   For a total cost of $1,900 to $2,300.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.100]   And all commissions paid by seller
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.780]   to be credited to buyer at close of escrow.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.540]   This is the key.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.580]   You just credit the buyer so that the buyer can pay for this.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.660]   And that is the workaround.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.140]   And why would a seller ever credit the buyer?
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.620]   Well, it's to get the deal closed, right?
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.700]   The seller wants to sell and it's a negotiation.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.220]   You've got to give and take.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.940]   It is the way things are.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.220]   And there's another addendum.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.060]   It says, if the transaction does not close,
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.700]   the buyer to receive $500 credit towards future transactions.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.980]   So this is an incentive for the buyer
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.620]   to keep on using the buyer's agent.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.620]   And everything is negotiable, folks.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.740]   The prices that I just said are negotiable.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.060]   You might want to incentivize the buying agent
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   to try to get you a better price or a lower price on the deal.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.180]   And if they can get it down by, let's say, every $10,000,
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.020]   they earn an extra 10%.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.380]   Or so, whatever it is.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.820]   Every dollar you save from the price that the agent is asking,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.500]   the listing agent is asking, the buyer agent gets 10%.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.180]   So if you save $100,000 from their purchase price,
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.180]   10%, $10,000 goes to the buyer's agent.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.740]   I think that's very well worth it.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.740]   You still save a net $90,000.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.740]   So I think this type of structure,
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.020]   this type of agreement will be more commonplace.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.980]   It's very clear.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.980]   It's a pay for service, which I think is fair.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.420]   And in a way, I think it could generate more revenue
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.980]   for buyer's agents.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.620]   Now, you let me know what you think about this fee structure.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.820]   I think it's quite fair.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.460]   And if you negotiated and both sides agree,
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.660]   then it is, by definition, fair and affordable
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.340]   because both sides agree to it and signed to the contract.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.460]   Now, let's just do a quick example of how both seller
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.780]   and the buyer and both agents win.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.100]   Here's a scenario where a listing agent charges a 2%
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.180]   commission to list and successfully sells a $500,000
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.580]   house.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.140]   First of all, the listing agent earns $10,000 gross commission.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.780]   2% times $500,000.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.500]   And despite the 2% commission being slightly lower
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.780]   than the 2.5% to 3% commission they might have earned
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.660]   with a 5% to 6% commission and splitting it
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.420]   with the buyer's agent, it remains pretty good.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:30.620]   2% is just 0.5% to 1% below what they could have earned
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.900]   before the settlement.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.380]   Secondly, by opting for a 2% commission instead
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.260]   of the traditional 5% to 6% commission,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.540]   the home seller saves $15,000 to $20,000.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.340]   So 3% to 4% times $500,000 is $15,000 to $20,000.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.660]   That's a clear benefit and a winner.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.420]   And again, I've already said that home sellers
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.340]   or residential real estate owners or investors
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.580]   win the most from the settlement.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.300]   Third, the buyer's agent, under the agreement
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.980]   I just talked about, earns $2,000 gross.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.700]   And that is also a win.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.980]   Lastly, the home buyer receives a $3,000 credit
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.420]   from the home seller.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.100]   And that represents 20% of the 3% commission savings.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.300]   In other words, 0.6% times $500,000 equals $3,000.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.780]   Because the seller wants to close the transaction
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.300]   and share the wealth of the commission savings.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.820]   They could have offered more than 20% of 3%.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.340]   They could have done 30%, 40%.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.380]   They could have done 50%.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.580]   It's everything negotiable.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.420]   But the point is there is a winning scenario here.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.260]   And consequently, in this example,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.340]   the home buyer effectively makes $1,000 from the purchase
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.020]   because they got a $3,000 credit
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.980]   and they only had to pay the buyer's agent $2,000.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.540]   So how about them apples?
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.460]   That sounds like a quadruple win.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.060]   Okay, the home seller's overall commission rate
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:06.060]   isn't 2% because they offered 30% of the 3% savings.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.220]   So the net overall commission rate for the home seller
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.780]   is 2.6%.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.980]   And that's still lower, 2.4% and 3.4% lower
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.100]   than the "standard" 5% to 6% rate.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.300]   And yes, buyer's agents will earn less than they would
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.820]   if they could have earned 2.5% to 3% commission rate.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.300]   What is that, $12,500 to $15,000 they could have earned
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.500]   if they successfully represented their buyer
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.100]   to buy this house.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.660]   But they still make $2,000 and it's honestly a reflection
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.900]   of the dynamics of free markets.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.220]   Free markets determine this and home buyers will determine
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.380]   how much they're willing to pay for a buyer's agent.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.340]   The market has changed, think about it.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.560]   The majority of home buyers are now taking charge
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.660]   of their home search online themselves.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.260]   They're browsing listings and attending open houses.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.300]   When I go to open houses, 95% of the people browsing
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.500]   aren't browsing with their real estate agent.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.780]   I don't know why, but their real estate agents
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.460]   are doing something else.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.900]   And then thanks to platforms like Zillow and Redfin,
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.540]   home buyers can access all the necessary data
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.260]   to determine fair market prices for comparable homes.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.100]   Heck, Zillow has its estimate and Redfin also has
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.180]   its estimate and you can look at the comps yourself
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.340]   and come up with your own estimate after you look
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.780]   at the homes individually or through open houses.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.140]   And then making an offer, very simple now with DocuSign.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   Literally, you just click buttons, it's a preset form
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.540]   and you just click the buttons with your signature
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.660]   and you can do it within five minutes.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.940]   And that's the strategy I've used, spray and pray.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.140]   You just make all these offers to homes that you like,
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.400]   maybe you underbid on them, whatever,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.820]   and you just never know because the opportunity cost
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.860]   isn't as great anymore.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.260]   You don't have to meet in person to sign whatever,
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.460]   how many pages of documents physically.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.020]   It's so easy through DocuSign.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.900]   Meanwhile, home buyers can educate themselves online
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.700]   at no cost, they can learn about the home escrow process,
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.140]   the earnest money deposit, financing options,
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.180]   home inspection contingencies, financing contingencies,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.000]   how to write a real estate love letter.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.380]   You can find all of this on Financial Samurai
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.740]   if you just Google whatever it is you wanna learn
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.500]   and add Financial Samurai, you will find many, many,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.100]   many answers because I'm a real estate enthusiast
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.860]   who has been buying his own real estate since 2003.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.100]   And so in conclusion, there will be very big changes.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.980]   They'll be maybe slow, but I think they're gonna be faster
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.660]   than expected because the consumer, the home seller
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.540]   and the home buyer is getting more educated more quickly
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.340]   than ever before thanks to podcasts, blog posts,
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.980]   media reports and social media.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.260]   And net net, I think this is a good thing
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.580]   because the five to 6% is a wealth transfer in the way
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.900]   towards efficiency and free markets.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.900]   Old Americans look like they're staying
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.500]   in their homes for longer.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.900]   And as a result, they are benefiting.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.940]   They are riding that real estate wave because again,
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.260]   the ideal time period to own a home is forever.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.540]   And so with real estate commissions coming down,
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.140]   I hope you all hold your real estate holdings
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.040]   for longer as well.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.060]   Thanks so much everyone for listening.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.460]   For those interested in investing in residential real estate

[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.740]   Both Ben Miller, the CEO and I think we have passed
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.620]   the bottom of the real estate market.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.660]   I think that was in third quarter of 2023.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.140]   We think mortgage rates will be coming down.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.740]   I think there's pent up demand.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.220]   And I think the trend is a multi-decade trend
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.060]   towards demographic shifts,
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.660]   towards the lower cost areas of the country.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.180]   Thanks to technology and work from home.
