[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   great hack I discovered the other day, option and clicking on a Mac on your time in the corner,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.920]   automatically puts your Mac into do not disturb mode, which automatically silences all notifications
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.680]   except the ones that you let through from a loved one or something like that. So I've been using
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.760]   that a lot this last week. And now I just don't see my notifications until I go to the toilet to
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.520]   take a break. I'm like, Oh, hello. I'm so glad I missed all the notifications because they would
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.880]   have just completely taken me out of flow and gotten me very distracted.
