[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, both Paul and Moses said that they would rather be personally damned in
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.720]   order for others to be saved by way of a trade. So doesn't this imply that their
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.000]   vision of mission was higher in their priority list than their personal and
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.760]   eternal joy in the presence of God? In other words, didn't Paul and Moses
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.600]   prioritize mission over joy in God? It's a great question and it comes from Josiah
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.360]   in Michigan. "Dear Pastor John, when I first heard of Christian hedonism I was
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.760]   put off. I recognized that with God the concept of altruism breaks down, but I
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.960]   still considered it virtuous for the biblical examples of Moses and Paul.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.960]   Moses, while trying to make atonement for the sins of the Israelites, the golden
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.160]   calf, offers to God the option of blotting himself from the book of
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.680]   salvation rather than fully punishing the people." That's in Exodus 32. 32. "And the
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.840]   Apostle Paul said he wished he were accursed and cut off from Christ for the
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   sake of my brothers, my kinsmen, according to the flesh, the unbelieving Jews." That in
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.680]   Romans 9.3. "As I work through your book Desiring God, I have become more fond of
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.200]   the theology but still don't see how it works with the above two passages which
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.800]   seem altruistic. My question is how could a Christian hedonist with a properly
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.120]   ordered mind accept eternal separation from his greatest delight for the sake
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.720]   of achieving some other end? Aren't Paul or Moses suggesting a personal end in
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.040]   which the salvation of the lost, not God himself, is their highest concern?" No, I
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   don't think that is what Paul and Moses are suggesting, namely that the salvation
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.080]   of the lost has a higher value to them than the glory of God. I don't think so.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.560]   Let me deal directly with Paul and his words in Romans 9.2 and 3 since I
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   think they are more difficult than the words of Moses in Exodus because they
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.720]   have a direct reference to damnation, not just death. Paul is talking about his
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.840]   love for his Jewish kinsmen and says, "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   in my heart, for I could wish," we'll come back to that wording, it's very important,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   "I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.200]   my brothers, my kinsmen, according to the flesh." Here's the problem. Christian
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   hedonism, my view of the Christian life, says that we ought to aim at maximizing
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.160]   our eternal joy in God in everything we do. In God is our supreme treasure, our
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.240]   supreme value, and we should seek this eternal joy in God's presence even if it
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.040]   means selling all that we have, giving it to the poor, being persecuted for
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.880]   righteousness sake, returning good for evil in this life with no hope of any
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.080]   reward in this life for all the good that we do, and finally dying through
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.400]   torture or nameless in a strange foreign land. Yes, whatever it costs, we're going
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.440]   to pursue our joy in God maximally forever. And in Romans 9.3, Paul expresses
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.720]   his willingness, it seems, to be damned for the sake of his Jewish loved ones. He
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.040]   says, "I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.160]   sake of my brothers, my kinsmen, according to the flesh." And the ESV
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:55.720]   translation of the imperfect Greek tense of the verb "could wish," "I could wish," and
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:04.560]   that tense implies incomplete action, which I think is a very good translation
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   here. "I could wish" implies that something is standing in the way of Paul carrying
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   through this wish, and the action is still in process and can't get through.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.760]   "I could wish," namely, his willingness to be cut off from Christ. It's hindered and
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.440]   can't be carried through. Indeed, it can't. God is not the kind of God that damns a
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.920]   man for loving God's reputation and lost people. So being damned because you are
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.280]   supremely loving is not going to happen. That's not the universe that God created
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:55.680]   and runs. Here's the problem. The problem is Paul's apparent willingness that if he
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.040]   lived in a universe like that, he would be willing to be cursed and cut off from
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.840]   Christ. And so the question is, is that acting as a Christian hedonist? Is his
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.920]   heart responding like a Christian hedonist? So let me try to put myself—this
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   is what I've done—to try to be as honest with myself and my theology as I
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.000]   can be, I try to put myself in Paul's place. So here we go. I'm going to imagine
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.040]   myself before God in this situation. Suppose I were standing before
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.880]   the Lord with my wife, whom I love very much more than anybody else on the
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:41.040]   planet, and suppose God says to me, "One of you may enter heaven to be with me
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   forever. Only one. And the other to hell. And John, you choose. You choose which it
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.320]   will be, yourself or your wife, Noelle." Now, this is a very dangerous hypothetical
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.680]   situation to imagine, because it will never exist, the Lord does not put us in
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.280]   that situation. It would be virtually blasphemous for him to be putting us in
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.080]   that situation, and he does not send any person to hell who values him so highly
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.440]   and loves others so deeply as to put their fellowship with Christ above his
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.040]   own. But even though this hypothetical situation is dangerous, Paul seems to go
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.000]   there. He is doing this to make it as clear as he can to his Jewish kinsmen
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.760]   how much he loves them and wants their eternal good. So I've tried to be as
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.640]   honest as I can be in answering the Lord's question, "You or your wife, which
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   will it be, Mr. Christian Hedonist?" And I believe my answer would be, I hope and
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.040]   pray my answer would be, "Let her into heaven." As I have tried to get inside my
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.280]   head at that moment, imagine what would go through my mind. It would go something
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:15.520]   like this. If I say, "Let her go to hell and let me enter heaven," everything in me
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:23.280]   as a lover of Jesus and all that God is for me in Jesus, everything in me would
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:32.360]   want to curl up in a ball and groan and scream and chew my hands with shame.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.520]   Everything in me would want to run away and hide from the face of the Lord. There
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.040]   are no dreams of everlasting joy. No, no, no, no. There would only be everlasting
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.720]   shame for John Piper. This is not heaven. This is no sweet communion with Christ
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:01.240]   forever and ever. This is moral horror to live with myself with that. Not only that,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   but when I ponder, on the other hand, the possibility of seeing Noel absolutely,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:17.760]   utterly, sinlessly whole, never again to feel pain or depression or sorrow, but
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.880]   only breathtaking happiness and radiance in the presence of Christ greater than
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:34.000]   she has ever known, everything in me says, "That would be a glorious sight. Oh, how I
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.480]   would love to see that sight. That sight would make my soul explode with
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:50.800]   gladness." In other words, if I chose for Noel to be damned, heaven would be hell
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.180]   for me, and if I chose for her to be saved, my hell-bound heart would sing in
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:06.520]   the flames. Heaven's joy of love would be with me in hell, which means that heaven
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:13.800]   would not be heaven, and hell would not be hell. It is impossible that heaven be
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:20.080]   filled with hellish shame, and that hell be filled with heaven's joy, and I
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:28.160]   suspect that precisely this impossibility is why Paul wrote Romans 9:3 with the
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:37.320]   exact wording that he did. "I could wish." He thought it through. "I could wish that I
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:44.400]   myself were accursed and cut off from Christ," or literally, "I was wishing, but
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.520]   the impossibility of the hypothetical situation made the wish unfulfillable."
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.240]   The wish cannot be carried through in a world where the God of the Bible exists.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.120]   So the upshot seems to be this, it's kind of surprising. Paul's willingness to be
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.680]   cut off from Christ for the sake of his Jewish kinsmen, like my willingness to
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.600]   be cut off from Christ for my wife's salvation, is rooted precisely in the
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.000]   commitments of Christian hedonism. I shrink back from the heaven of moral
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.280]   horror where I would experience eternal shame, and I embrace hell where my
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.560]   conscience is clear and the joy of my wife's salvation makes me glad. In fact, I
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.680]   would argue that it is precisely the impulses of Christian hedonism that make
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   Romans 9:3 work the way it does. Christian hedonism believes passionately
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.800]   the words of the Lord Jesus that when we face a painful sacrifice of love, we
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.640]   should remember it is more blessed to give than to receive. That's what was
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.760]   happening at that moment, remembering that, imagining that, tasting that.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.200]   Christian hedonism shrinks back with loathing from the selfishness that kills
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:11.000]   that blessedness. Therefore, Christian hedonism drives Paul to flee from the
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.480]   remorse and self-loathing and horrors of conscience and divine disapproval that
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.400]   would come to him if he chose his own rescue over the rescue of his kinsmen. So
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:30.960]   my conclusion is, Romans 9:3 is not the Achilles heel of Christian hedonism.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.720]   Christian hedonism is the key to Romans 9:3. Incredibly sobering thoughts here,

[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.320]   me to be happy, or does God want me to be holy? It seems by mentions in Scripture
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.400]   that God is more concerned with our holiness over our happiness. So how do
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.040]   happiness and holiness relate? It's an incredibly vital question, and it's on
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.880]   the table next time. I'm your host Tony Ranke. We'll see you back here on
