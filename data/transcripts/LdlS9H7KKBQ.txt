[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   What is the easiest step of love?
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.360]   A step so easy you can accomplish it
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.000]   before you even get out of bed in the morning.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   Today we find the answer in an unsuspecting context.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.240]   The answer comes in an old sermon from John Piper
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080]   on 1 Timothy 2 verses one to four.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   And it happens to be my favorite sermon to turn to
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   when geopolitical tensions become evident in the world
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.600]   as we've seen a lot in the year 2022.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.420]   The sermon is an early one preached back
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.800]   on January 20th, 1981.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.460]   In fact, it was preached just two days
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.140]   before the Iran hostage crisis came to an end.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.620]   Also the same day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.880]   as the new president of the United States.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.500]   There was a lot of national and international news
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.320]   in the air when Pastor John preached the sermon
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.080]   on 1 Timothy 2.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.780]   In this context, the Apostle Paul was eager for Christians
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.400]   to hold to the faith with a good conscience.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.480]   That's 1 Timothy 1.19.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.560]   And to that end, as Paul explains,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.520]   Christians should entertain a global view of reality.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.640]   That's why Paul urges these early Christians
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.600]   to offer supplications, prayers, intercessions,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.960]   and thanksgivings.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.000]   Be made for all people, for kings,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.840]   and for all who are in high positions
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.920]   that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.320]   godly and dignified in every way.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320]   This is good and it is pleasing
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.580]   in the sight of God our Savior,
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.620]   who desires all people to be saved
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.820]   and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.480]   That's 1 Timothy 2, verses one to four.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.960]   For individual Christians, these prayers for kings,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900]   prayers for the leaders of nations,
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.520]   is essential to keeping a clean conscience
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.620]   and not shipwrecking our faith.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.380]   It's an incredible claim, connecting our awareness of
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.800]   and love for the globe's rulers
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.640]   to our own perseverance in the faith.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.340]   Here's Pastor John to explain how all this works.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.360]   - A good conscience is a conscience that does not
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.640]   condemn us for what we do
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.120]   and that approves of what we do do.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.960]   Did I say that right?
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.400]   Does not condemn us for what we do
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.620]   and approves us for what we do.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.760]   That means, therefore, that the reason Paul is saying
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   you've got to have a clear conscience
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.560]   in order to maintain faith
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   is that if we do things that our conscience
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   constantly condemns,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.800]   what's gonna happen is something like this.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.520]   This is the way my experience works anyway.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.280]   See if yours doesn't also.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.640]   If I fall into a habit that my conscience condemns,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.600]   my conscience starts to say to me,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   Piper, all that talk about trusting Christ
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   and hoping in God is a lot of hot air
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   because if you really trusted in Christ and hoped in God,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.480]   you wouldn't go on breaking your conscience like that.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.740]   And therefore, conscience starts to bore holes
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.720]   in the belly of the ship of faith
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.600]   and it starts to sink.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.960]   And your confidence in the reality of your own conversion
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.600]   starts to melt away
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.300]   because you're constantly acting against your own conscience.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.660]   And either one of two things is going to happen.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.460]   Either we confirm the genuineness of our faith
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.080]   by changing our behavior
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.620]   and plugging up those holes of conscience,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.400]   or we go on and we show that our ship of faith
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.840]   was never seaworthy in the first place
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.160]   and we sink into unbelief and blasphemy
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.080]   like Hymenaeus and Alexander did.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   And therefore, Paul's charge to Timothy to hold to faith
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.360]   and maintain a good conscience
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   are tremendously important commands or admonitions.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.000]   And anything that Paul can say
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.920]   that will help us maintain a good conscience
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.160]   ought to be welcomed with open arms.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.800]   And I think that's what he does in verse one of chapter two.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.200]   "Since you must keep a good conscience
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.320]   in order not to make shipwreck of faith,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   therefore, I urge you first of all, pray for all men."
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.920]   Now, in order to see why it is
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   that failing to pray for all men
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.860]   will give us a bad conscience
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.280]   and jeopardize our faith,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.520]   I think we have to ask, what is it
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.820]   that for a Christian pricks his conscience
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.280]   in relation to other people?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.320]   And the answer to that, of course,
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.160]   is clear from the whole Bible.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.920]   All of God's instruction is summed up in two commandments.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.720]   Love God with your whole being
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.840]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.620]   In other words, anything that a Christian does
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.820]   or leaves undone, which is unloving,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.560]   will give him a bad conscience
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.320]   or ought to give him a bad conscience if it's not seared.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.840]   Now, with that as a foundation,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600]   I think it starts to become clear
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   why we must pray for other people
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.780]   in order to keep a clean conscience
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.720]   and so not make shipwreck of faith.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.620]   I see three reasons why prayer for other people
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.240]   is of first importance.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.120]   And that's what I'm after to explain.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.060]   How come he says it's of first importance
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.320]   in keeping a clear conscience
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.520]   and not making shipwreck of faith?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   First, prayer taps the power of God
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.520]   on behalf of other people.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.440]   I could try to help you as a pastor.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.940]   You could try to help your neighbors.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.940]   You could try to help Ronald Reagan,
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.940]   Governor Cui, Mayor Frazer, without praying for them.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.500]   And you might do a little good.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.120]   And judged from a limited perspective,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.360]   you could do perhaps much good in the world's eyes.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.840]   But the little good that we could do without praying
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.760]   isn't worthy to be compared with the great good
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.480]   that God can do if he, in response to our prayer,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.800]   starts working on behalf of another person.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.880]   So if we want to do what's best for people,
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.360]   if we really love them,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   then I think of first importance
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   will be to pray that God work for them.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.480]   The first thing you do for a person if you love them
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   is ask God to work on their behalf.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.840]   And of course, the way that God answers that prayer
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.560]   is almost always going to involve
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.840]   your labor of love on their behalf.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.520]   But what can be accomplished through prayer
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.400]   is vastly more than you could accomplish without prayer.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.600]   There's a second reason why I think it's of first importance
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.720]   to keep our conscience clear
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.020]   through praying for other people.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.640]   It's the easiest step of love.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.280]   You don't even have to get out of bed
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.480]   to pray for kings and all those who are in high positions.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.620]   It doesn't take any great physical strain,
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.680]   no great financial output.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.920]   Of all the forms that love can take,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.260]   prayer is probably the easiest.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.080]   You just get down on your knees and rest
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.920]   and talk to the Lord about what you want him to do
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.840]   for other people.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.960]   And isn't it true that if we are unwilling to do
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.800]   for other people what is easiest,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.400]   then it's very unlikely that we will be willing to do
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.800]   what's hard on their behalf.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.520]   And therefore, it makes sense, doesn't it,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.960]   that Paul would begin by saying of first importance
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.520]   if you want to love other people is that you pray for all men.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.880]   Third reason why I think it's of paramount importance.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   Prayer reaches farther than anything else in its effects
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.400]   that we can do.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.200]   It reaches farther in its effects
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.040]   than anything else we can do.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.560]   Before there were those satellites up there
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.360]   going around the Earth, we could send a live television
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.200]   program from coast to coast.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.080]   But we couldn't send it, could we,
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.280]   all the way around to the other side of the world live.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.760]   But now, if we want to get it to the other side of the world
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.880]   live immediately, we send it away from the world
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   and then it comes back to the world.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.960]   Pretty simple.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.720]   Get it live immediately.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.880]   And I think that's a beautiful picture
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.760]   of the efficacy and extension of prayer.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   Without prayer, we can have an influence
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.880]   on a limited circumference of people.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.600]   We can work hard and try to do good for them.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.000]   And if we wait long enough, maybe by osmosis,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.920]   our influence will spread all the way around the world.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.160]   But God's influence is everywhere and immediate.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.560]   And therefore, doesn't it make sense
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.240]   that first of all, if we want to help other people,
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.440]   if you want to bless the most people in the shortest
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.600]   amount of time with the most blessing,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.280]   it just makes sense that you'd start by going to the satellite,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.720]   going to God.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.880]   When a broadcaster wants to get a message to the greatest
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.120]   amount of people in the shortest amount of time,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.240]   you can be sure that's going to happen today
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.720]   if those hostages are released before this service is over
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.920]   or before we meet tonight.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.480]   We're all going to know about it because of those satellites.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.080]   If a broadcaster wants to do that,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.360]   isn't it interesting that paradoxically,
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   to get the message quickest this way, he sends it that way.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.680]   And that's what we should do for other people.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.640]   To bless them quickest this way, we should look that way.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.280]   First, up to God.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.240]   So if we would not make shipwreck of faith,
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.000]   but rather keep a clear conscience,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.480]   therefore, we must pray for all men
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.240]   because of these three reasons.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.720]   Prayer taps the power of God for other people.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.840]   Prayer is the first and easiest step of love.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.280]   And prayer reaches farther in its effects
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.360]   than anything else that we can do.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.760]   Powerful, especially given the historical setting
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.640]   of this sermon unfolding 40 years ago.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.280]   That sermon is titled Pray for Kings and All in High
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.800]   Positions, preached on January 18, 1981,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.160]   just two days before the Iran hostage crisis ended.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.640]   And Ronald Reagan was inaugurated
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.680]   as the new president of the United States.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.840]   The entire sermon is online at desiringgod.org.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.720]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.560]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.880]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.640]   And make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.080]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.160]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.720]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.080]   Well, some of the very best questions you all send to us
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.520]   come from tensions that you see directly in scripture,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.280]   like the one coming up on Friday.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.760]   Do we pray for the salvation of unbelievers directly?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.080]   Or do we pray for the evangelists who bring
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   the gospel to those unbelievers?
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.960]   It's a sharp Bible question.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.920]   And it's up next time.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.680]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.400]   We'll rejoin in studio with Pastor John
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.000]   when we return on Friday.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.840]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.520]   [END PLAYBACK]
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   [AUDIO OUT]
