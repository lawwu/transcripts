[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.200]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.840]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360]   With all that's happening in the markets right now, it had me thinking a bit about
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.760]   my guest from episode six, Morgan Housel, who talks about how volatility in the
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.880]   stock market should be viewed more as a fee for admission than necessarily a
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.400]   fine.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.800]   I think that's a really helpful perspective, especially given what's going
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.120]   on.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.240]   It's currently mid-May 2022.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.520]   We're getting awfully close to bear market.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.680]   So today I want to bring on Nick Maggiuli, who shares a similar sentiment to Morgan
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.920]   and has written about it on multiple occasions.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.520]   He's the COO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, but he's also a writer, investor, and
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.560]   data scientist who regularly uses data to produce insights and great content about
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.480]   investing and personal finance on his blog of Dollars and Data, and he recently
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.200]   released his first book, Just Keep Buying, Proven Ways to Save Money and Build Your
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.600]   Wealth.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.120]   He's covered a lot on his blog and in his book, but I'm really excited to dig into
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.200]   his focus on income producing assets, why you might not want to max out your 401(k),
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   investing during a downturn, getting comfortable with spending more, and why
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.960]   you'll probably never feel rich.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.040]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.160]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.920]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.200]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   investment decisions.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.800]   Nick, thank you for being here.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   Thanks for having me on, Chris.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.800]   Appreciate it.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.520]   So you talk about volatility in the market being kind of the price for admission for
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.400]   people interested in buying stocks.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.760]   How do you think people should be thinking about this?
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.160]   I agree completely.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.280]   It is like a fee for admission, except the fee isn't paid.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.920]   You don't actually have to necessarily pay it.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.440]   If you hold for a long enough time in a diverse set of income producing assets,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.160]   you never have to physically pay it.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.440]   You pay it with your emotional costs of holding through all that stuff.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.120]   And so it's more of a, I'd say it's more of a mental fee than it is a actual
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.840]   financial transaction fee, right?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.200]   So keeping that in mind is what's important.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.840]   I think the thing for me that just like allows me to stay calm when markets are
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.400]   crashing.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.120]   I've just seen this happen so often.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.920]   Actually, tomorrow I'm writing a blog post about this.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.320]   It's just like, I've been investing for 10 years and on average, the market
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.720]   declines by a little bit, a little over 10% every other year, 30% every four to
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.720]   five years and 50% like once a generation.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.680]   So let's say every 20 to 25 years, right?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   We did have two 50% declines in the two thousands.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   There was the.com followed by the great recession, but the last 50%
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.240]   decline before that was 74.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.720]   So this is all on average, but if it's happening every other year, then like
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.000]   you shouldn't be panicking over this.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   Cause these types of things just happen.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.240]   There's going to be different catalysts, different reasons that cause them.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.560]   That's why I can be like, Hey, this just stuff happens.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.680]   It's just like the nature of markets.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.000]   And it's going to keep happening that way.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.840]   And what do you say to someone who's like, gosh, it feels like it could get even
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.120]   worse.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.920]   Maybe I should get out before it bottoms.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.400]   Oh, let's say you do get out before bottoms, right?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.920]   Like, wow.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.240]   Okay.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.880]   I got out.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.840]   Maybe it goes down another 10%, right?
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.480]   But how do you know when the bottom's in?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.880]   How do you know when to get back in?
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   That's the problem.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.040]   It's like you have psychological like hell on the exit and then you have
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.480]   psychological hell on the reentry.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.720]   So it's not even about trying to time it.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.640]   Like that's why it's very difficult to do.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   But even if you got lucky on one side of the trade, you may get unlucky on the
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.080]   other side of the trade and you end up not making anything in the long run.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.800]   Like imagine you sold in like early March, 2020, right?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.920]   Like looking back now, that looks like a good idea.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.480]   But when did you get back in?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.120]   Within six months, we were at all time highs.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   Did you get back in before you passed your old price?
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.400]   Like probably not.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.640]   Right.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.000]   And that's the thing, because it would happen so quickly.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   Like it's really hard to predict that stuff.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   So I don't recommend those types of all or nothing type of moves.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.160]   If you are getting worried, I say make minor, very, very minor tweaks.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.680]   Just enough to get you to sleep at night, but not so much that you
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.040]   jeopardize your financial future.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.560]   So that's my hack there.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.120]   If you're going to sin, sin a little.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.840]   Don't sin a lot.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.080]   Don't.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's that's where people make big mistakes when they start moving everything too
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.600]   much based on short-term changes in information.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   And what would be a minor tweak?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.720]   Let's say I do like a 60/40 every month in my 401k and putting 60% into stocks,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.040]   40% into bonds, a minor tweak would be like, okay, I'm going to flip that.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.160]   I'm going to put 60% into bonds, 40% into stocks, right?
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.560]   Obviously it's a small change in money.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.240]   You're still investing in stocks, but you're doing it at a slower rate.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.400]   And you're putting more into bonds on the productive front.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.680]   Even having a rebalance, rebalancing back.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.480]   If stocks have fallen a lot and bonds haven't rebalancing back,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   that can also do things.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.640]   There's a lot of different ways of doing this and there's no right answer, right?
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.000]   Every person's going to feel differently.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.280]   Someone's like, I'm not going to feel safe if I lose another dollar in the market.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   Well, it's like, the truth is now, you know, your actual risk tolerance and you
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.360]   shouldn't have had that money invested in the first place, but Hey, you're here now.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   And if that's true, then yeah, you probably do need to get out completely
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.080]   because you didn't realize your risk tolerance and you should have had a very
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.680]   different portfolio before this happened.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.120]   I think a lot of people think, okay, well, the stock market goes up always.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.080]   So there's not really that much risk, but you kind of say sometimes the
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.240]   biggest risk you can take is not taking risk.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.440]   Can you talk a little bit more?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.320]   I guess you can look at it as two types of risk.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.120]   There's slow risk and fast risk.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.520]   Now I would define as fast risk is something like stock market
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.880]   crashes happens very quickly.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.600]   You know, COVID-19 the world shutting down, all that stuff.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.880]   Those are all types of fast risks.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.120]   They happen very quickly, right?
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.040]   Slow risk is something that accumulates over a long time.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.680]   So I think the analogy I like to use is with drugs, right?
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.080]   So someone doing heroin that they're taking on fast risk, they're probably
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.480]   going to overdose relatively quickly.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.400]   They're not going to be doing heroin for 20 years and then they get, I
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.720]   don't know, heroin cancer.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm not, it's not an equivalent, right?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.280]   For there's no cancer or you can get from heroin, but they're going to
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.440]   get some sort of cancer and then die.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.320]   But smoking is slow risk, right?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.120]   That's someone who you smoke a cigarette and nothing's going to happen from that.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.760]   You do it over 20, 30 years though.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.960]   And you can see the incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.640]   smoking, especially after a 20 year period.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.800]   So that's slow risk versus fast risk.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.040]   So holding cash is slow risk.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.600]   You're sitting there and just holding that cash.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.880]   And that's just going to be dwindled away by inflation.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.200]   And so the question is, which one's better?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.480]   And there's no right answer, but you have to figure out
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.520]   whichever risks you want to take.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   So I'm going to sit this one out and sit through cash.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.120]   Not only is your cash being inflated away, but if the
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.600]   market does happen to move up.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.840]   Like, for example, I had had people in 2017 telling me that,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.200]   Oh, markets are overvalued.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.080]   If you've been sitting in cash since then, you're, you lost
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.520]   out on a hundred percent gain, basically, even with the current
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.040]   decline, maybe 80, 90% gain.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.520]   So it's like, what risks do you want to take?
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.800]   And where do you want to take it?
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.280]   That's the things you need to think about.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.880]   So there's nothing wrong with sitting in cash, but as long as you know,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.160]   Hey, like I'm going to lose purchasing power over time by doing this.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.880]   As long as you've accepted that, let's say two to 4%, this last
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.720]   year inflation has been 8%, but that's generally not what happens
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.600]   over long periods of time.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800]   Let's just say 4% a year.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.000]   You're willing to accept that haircut on your money, then that's fine.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.240]   But in the short term, very little fluctuation, but that's
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.960]   what you have to deal with.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.480]   One thing you mentioned in there, which I just want you to drill down a
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   little bit more is about kind of trying to use that cash to time the market.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.360]   I always thought, okay, let's leave some cash on the sidelines so that
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.960]   when the market's down, which of course is very hard to predict, but we're
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.440]   in a situation like that now you can put it to work, but given how long
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.920]   it might take for that to happen, it sounds like not actually from
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.520]   the data, the best decision.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.640]   No, it's definitely not.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.840]   I mean, 80% of the time you're going to underperform if you
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.120]   follow a strategy like this.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.040]   There are cases where it does outperform.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.080]   So the time when it's best to hold cash is right before a big dip.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.240]   And then you have to time it pretty well to like buy into that dip.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   But the problem is dips are rare and big dips are especially rare.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.400]   Like if I had to go back and said how many 50% drawdowns if we had, or even
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.080]   let's just say 33% drawdowns, like what we had in COVID, it was 2020.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.760]   The one before that was 08, the one before that was 2000.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.680]   I think the only one before that, maybe 87.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.360]   We got to down 33 with everything.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.920]   I don't know if we did the time before that was 74.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.760]   So they're very rare.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.920]   And we keep going back through time is not a history lesson, but you get my point
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.960]   because they're so rare, the strategy doesn't work because you're sitting
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.800]   there in cash, hoping for this dip that never usually comes.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.880]   And so then you've just lost out on market gains that you could have had.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.120]   Basically, that's the whole issue with trying to time.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.520]   And I think what you said was if you were sitting around in 2017, thinking
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.040]   things are overvalued and you waited, even if you time the dip, you wouldn't
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.200]   come out ahead, is that right?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.560]   So if you started at the beginning of 2017 and let's say you held cash
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.000]   the whole time and you bought at the exact bottom on March 23rd, 2020, right?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.720]   That was the most recent bottom, at least, right?
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   Even if you perfectly time that, you still would have bought at prices
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.120]   7% higher than what you could have gotten early 2017.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.160]   Of course, that's still an incredible trade.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.480]   Like it's insane that you could do that.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   Like it just, it doesn't really work that way.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.280]   So yeah, I don't recommend trying to time the market.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.920]   It's tough.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.800]   It's just too tough.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.120]   I've shown some evidence that if you can do it even somewhat, okay, you
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.080]   might be able to make some money on it, but it's really tough and most
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.400]   people can't do it over the long run.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.680]   You just end up losing out.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.080]   What do you say about now?
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.400]   Now we're not trying to time the market, but we are in a down market, right?
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.560]   Depending on what day this airs, maybe we hit bear market.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.440]   Maybe we recover.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.160]   And a lot of this is not relevant, which I guess we are all hoping for.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.960]   But when you're already in the down market, is there
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.080]   something to do differently?
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.800]   If you have a way of getting more cash, of course, I'm
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.960]   not against buying the dip.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.680]   I'm against holding cash and waiting to buy the dip.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.400]   They're very different things because conditional on you being in a dip, let's
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.920]   say you just sold a business or you got an inheritance and by chance you happen
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.720]   to get a big cash infusion when the market's down, that is one of the best
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.240]   times to buy because if the market does recover as we expect it to over some
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.800]   period of time, you're looking at higher expected return.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.000]   I cover this in chapter 17 of the book.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.720]   The math on this is very simple.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   So let's just use the COVID example.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.960]   So for every percentage decline, you need a larger percentage
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   gain to get back to even.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.600]   This is just a mathematics, right?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.000]   So let's say we're at a hundred and the price goes down 33%.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.320]   So something's at a hundred goes to 66 to get from 66 back to a hundred.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.840]   You have to go up 50%, right?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.720]   66 has to go up by 33 more roughly, right?
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.960]   Which is 50% gain.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.640]   So X percent drop requires a larger gain to get back to even.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   So if you had bought on March 23rd, 2020, all we need to do is figure out, okay,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.160]   how long do you think it's going to take for the market to recover?
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.520]   You have some estimates, some time estimate, and then based on that, we
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.040]   can back out your expected return.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.160]   So even if you thought it was going to take five years for the market to recover,
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.920]   right, you're looking at a 50% upside over five years, that's roughly 10%.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.040]   I should do the compounding math.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.080]   It's less, it's like 8.5% a year, but let's just make it linear to
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.960]   make it easy for us, right?
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.720]   Mentally, you're looking at 10% a year.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.840]   That's a pretty good return.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.200]   If it took five years, right?
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.120]   Even if it took two years, you're looking at what?
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.920]   50 divided by two, that's 25% a year returns.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.280]   You're like, who wouldn't want that?
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.800]   So if you think the COVID is going to recover in two to three years, you're
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   looking at some pretty good returns if you buy, right?
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.000]   What actually happened?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.200]   The market was back at all time highs within six months.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.160]   And you had something like a 106% annualized return, which is like
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.400]   one of the greatest of all time.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.480]   Now, I'm not saying that that's going to happen here.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.880]   I don't know, but that's just, that's the thinking you need to get into.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.480]   So, oh, we're 20% off the high, right?
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.000]   To get back to even let's say it's whatever, like 25%, right?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.640]   You know, if a hundred went to 80, you'd have to go up by 20, which is 25% of 80.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.240]   So you need a 25% gain.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.760]   Okay.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.400]   If you think it's going to take two years to get back to our old high,
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.320]   let's say it takes two years.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.440]   That's 12 and a half percent, roughly doing the linear math there.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.000]   Do you not want 12 and a half percent right now?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.280]   That's a pretty good return, right?
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.120]   All else equal, but maybe it doesn't take two years.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.720]   Maybe it takes five years to get back to high.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.200]   Then you can see why it's not as good of a deal.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.240]   You know, if you were to divide 25 by five, now it's only a 5%
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.280]   return, which isn't as great.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.400]   In the book, you said there are two good reasons to take on debt.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.280]   One of them was when your expected return is higher than the cost.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.160]   Does that mean that it could be a good idea right now to borrow,
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.960]   to invest when the market's down?
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.520]   Is there risk there that's beyond the expected return
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.240]   that people should be thinking about?
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.720]   So I would not recommend that under most of almost all circumstances.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.560]   I think like technically, yes, the expected return could be higher.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.000]   The problem is we don't know the future.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.720]   Like we could be at the beginning of a five-year bear market.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.320]   And so borrowing money to then invest is a very risky proposition,
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.720]   unless like you could easily pay off that debt, unless you're like,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.520]   you know what, I'm going to take this risk.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.200]   I'm going to lever.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.560]   And even if it goes south, I can easily pay it off.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.320]   You borrow like 2% of your net worth.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.600]   There's not some really small amount.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.720]   You could try that.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.680]   I don't think it's worth the hassle and effort and stress of
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.000]   that to do something like that.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.080]   But you're right.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.520]   If the drawdown was bigger, yes.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.560]   I think, I don't think we're there yet.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   We were down 20, but now the market's rallied today.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.240]   And I don't know where it's going to be by the time this gets released,
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.640]   as you know.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.360]   So I don't know.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.200]   I think it's too, it's a risky proposition.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.720]   I don't recommend that type of stuff because you can get really
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.320]   wrecked by trying to lever up.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.960]   I'm not here recommending it or proposing that you recommend it.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.000]   The way I thought about it was, gosh, maybe if I had a certain
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.800]   amount of money, I wanted to invest over the next three months.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.080]   Maybe I could invest those three months today and to just
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.120]   pay it back in two months.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.080]   Like I always say, when you borrow money, you need a plan to pay it
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.800]   back and you need to be comfortable with rates and a lot of borrowing
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.760]   against your portfolio, against your home, sometimes those rates aren't fixed.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.440]   I will throw to anyone out there listening, thinking buying the dip,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.520]   maybe I should borrow for the expected return.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.440]   One, take all the advice you just gave.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.080]   And two, there are some expectations of interest rates going up, which
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.440]   could mean that that equation of how much it costs to borrow is going up also.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.040]   So from my perspective, I don't think it's a timely or wise thing to do,
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.920]   but I thought I'd touch on it a little.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.560]   Yeah, I generally don't recommend that.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.640]   If you have extra cash, that's investable cash.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   I don't think for an emergency or anything, you have to have extra
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.120]   cash by chance, go ahead and buy.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.320]   Right.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.520]   But if not, I'd say, wait, don't do anything like that.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.200]   Don't go beyond your means, basically.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.400]   But another way to buy the dip in a sense could be to just rebalance.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.440]   If your stock portfolio is down significantly and you want it to be at
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.040]   80/20 and you're at 70/30, you could sell some of those bonds when
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.280]   they're down and buy more stocks.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.640]   That's another way of doing this.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.960]   And obviously it happens in the reverse too, when people think they're
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.480]   overheated and you reverse back, you sell some of the stocks to buy bonds.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.520]   You can do the same thing there.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.080]   So it works both ways, right?
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.760]   It's a natural rebalancing process.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.320]   And over time, there will be drift.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.840]   The higher return asset will eat most of the portfolio over time.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.280]   And so, or become most of the portfolio over time.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.880]   So you'll have to just rebalance periodically.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.160]   Maybe we're out of this whole thing by the time this comes out.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.640]   So I don't want to spend too much time digging on how to
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.000]   invest when the market's down.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.600]   But let's talk a little bit about what to invest in.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.880]   You focus a lot in the book on income producing assets.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.000]   And when I heard that, I was like, "Hmm, I feel like I know what that is.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.160]   But I feel like maybe it would be better to get your definition."
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.560]   Yeah, these are assets that actually produce some sort of cashflow.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.520]   They have some sort of fundamentals around how they're priced.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.840]   So what that means is they're not just priced based on what people feel.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.720]   Of course, how people feel about assets is going to change how they're priced.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.560]   That's true of stocks, bonds, crypto, anything out there.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   That's going to be true, right?
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.640]   But income producing assets have some sort of fundamental...
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.440]   Like there's some weight there, which is the actual cash flows for that asset.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.600]   Assuming they have cash flows.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.000]   Like imagine a suitcase with $50,000 in it.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.840]   We all could be sitting here debating the value of the suitcase.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.600]   But if we know there's $50,000 in that cash, like that is a hard fact that we
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.240]   can use and be like, "Okay, the value of this suitcase should never
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.000]   go below $50,000," right?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.840]   Historically, that actually is not true because Warren Buffett used to buy
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.800]   something called Nets back in the day, which was like buying that $50,000
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.160]   suitcase for $25,000 because he would buy a company where the liquidation
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.840]   value of the company was worth more than what you could buy it for in the open market.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.720]   That's like an arbitrage.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.680]   Those should never happen.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.200]   And today, they basically never happen because people are smarter now and
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.000]   then people have more data and they're not allowing these types of things to happen.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.920]   But that's just an example of like income producing assets are just a
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.560]   fundamental weight that keeps prices in line.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.120]   And in the book, you outline a list of income producing assets.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   And some of them, I think most people will be familiar with.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.640]   Things like real estate and stocks.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.520]   But one that I think most people aren't is royalties.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.680]   Are some of these more alternative income producing assets, things that
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.040]   you talk about because they exist or you talk about because the average
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.560]   person might want to look into them?
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.400]   Well, I think it's something that people could consider looking into.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.800]   I don't think any single asset class is necessary to build wealth.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.080]   I think I've seen people do it with just real estate.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.600]   I've seen people do it with stocks.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.840]   I've seen people do it with farmland, etc.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.120]   Like there's no one that's required.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.280]   You don't need to have all these.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.760]   I'm just trying to expose people to different asset classes and different options.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.120]   I think, for example, in the case of farmland, that's something that during
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.400]   most good times, it's not really correlated as much with U.S. stocks.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.600]   Of course, most risk assets will decline together.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.480]   That's going to probably be farmland as well.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.760]   But the thing about farmland is it's just a different return stream.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.200]   And so because of that, it's going to behave differently than stocks.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.360]   Right.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.200]   So it's something to kind of keep in mind is like, hey, how am I
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.560]   diversified and what do I own?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.160]   So I don't think there's any reason why you need to use those.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.800]   You don't have to.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.080]   I just want to expose people to different ideas out there.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.320]   And just because they're like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.560]   Like if you're a big music fan, I could understand why you might want to own royalties.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.040]   I think there's a personal reason for that.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.280]   I'm a big music fan.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.800]   I think that's something I'll get into eventually.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.320]   There's a lot of accredited investor rules and things around some of those things.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.720]   So you have to just kind of wait until you can do that unless the rules change.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.600]   But that's just something to keep in mind.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.040]   And for anyone who doesn't know, royalties, you essentially can just buy
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.520]   the income from an asset like an album or an entire collection of albums.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.040]   And people sell these in private investor groups.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.600]   Is that right?
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.360]   Yeah, basically.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.640]   So you can say, hey, I want 10 years of royalties for this particular song.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.440]   And let's say they're selling those royalties for, I don't know, let's say 20 grand.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.000]   That's what they sell.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.440]   And you get 10 years of it, right?
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.680]   But last year, the song made five grand in income, right?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.880]   So they would have paid you five grand.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.200]   You're like, well, Nick, that's a great thing.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.120]   If I got five grand for the next 10 years, you know, that's 50 grand.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   I only paid 20 grand for it.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.040]   That's a great return.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.080]   The problem is you don't know if the listens and streams and all those royalties
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.960]   are going to be five grand a year.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   They might be declining over time.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   You need to see the history.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.120]   You need to guess about the future.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.360]   Obviously, if one of those artists were to die or something, you would see a huge spike
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.840]   in the royalties in that one year.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.760]   Maybe the royalties would permanently be elevated.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.280]   You don't know.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.680]   And so you're guessing around the future.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.200]   But it's also like a cultural investment.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.480]   I think it's more like social than it is necessarily just the cash flows.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.880]   But they both definitely matter.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.920]   So you said, "Don't buy individual stocks."
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.120]   But I'm curious if the message is more, "Don't trade stocks."
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.440]   And that if you want to buy 20 companies that you're excited about
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.400]   and build that kind of basket of long-term investments,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.520]   how do you feel about that approach?
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.240]   - It's relative to the percentage of your wealth.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.800]   So if you're doing that with 5% of your net worth, go ahead.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.640]   If you're doing it for fun, go ahead.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.520]   I don't care.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.280]   But if you're going to put the bulk of your wealth in 20 companies that you're crazy
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.560]   about, I think that is a less prudent strategy than owning like an index fund
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.200]   because the probability that those 20 companies are going to grow at the market
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.000]   rate over a long period of time is unlikely.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.240]   I mean, most companies die.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.880]   And the reason why you look at that chart of like, "Oh, here's the U.S.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.320]   economy," or $1 invested in stocks for the last 100 years or the S&P 500 for the last
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.920]   50 years, that line isn't realistic because the companies in that line are
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.240]   always changing over time.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.560]   The companies that are falling behind fall out, and the companies that are rising up
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.120]   get added in.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.320]   It's like a momentum strategy.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.240]   People don't realize that.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.360]   So if you just do a buy and hold of 20 random companies, say, "I'm going to hold
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.920]   these for the next 40 years," like half of those companies probably won't exist.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.600]   A couple of them will probably do really well.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.200]   But the question is, will those ones that do well offset all the ones that don't do
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.440]   well?
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.240]   And I don't know the answer to that.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.800]   And so, I don't recommend doing that for performance reasons.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.200]   But most importantly, I don't recommend doing it because what I call the existential
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.080]   reasons, which is you don't know if you're a good stock picker.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   And I can get into that whole argument if you want.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   But unlike most endeavors where you can identify your skill, your talent pretty
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.200]   quickly, with stock picking, we don't know.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.920]   Like you and I, Chris, can go pick a basket of stocks, come back a year.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.440]   And if yours outperforms mine, does that mean you're a better stock picker?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.240]   I don't think we can say that with certainty after one year.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.840]   I don't think we can say it even after five years.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.400]   Maybe 10, we'd have enough.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   Looking at our track records, we could probably say something.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.760]   But after one to two years, no one knows.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.880]   So, I just imagine someone who bought GameStop in July 2020, before the Wall
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.520]   Street Bets thing happened in early 2021, they had a huge return but had nothing to
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.800]   do with why they picked the stock.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.280]   Had zero to do with their intuition about that.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.080]   So, I think there's a lot of luck here, and that's what makes it tough.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.240]   You mentioned if we picked a basket of stocks, some won't be gone, which I think
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.920]   means it's maybe even more important to figure out when to sell.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.120]   So, I want to talk about that a little.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.960]   For me personally, it's tough, right?
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.000]   You pick a stock or you invest it in crypto early on or something where you have a little
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.280]   bit more of an attachment to it.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.600]   I don't have a particular attachment to VTI, right?
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.960]   Like the total stock market.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.960]   Nor do I want to stop holding it at any point.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.680]   But for all these other things that people might have invested in there, 10%, 15%, how
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.360]   do you think people should think about selling them?
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.720]   Or even if you work at a company and you just have the stock in that company and you have
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   beliefs about it, how do you make it easier to sell either in advance when I know you
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.160]   could say this is my criteria, but maybe when you're not that prepared in advance to have
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.280]   created criteria, how do you think about selling?
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.880]   I think there's 3 reasons to sell.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.320]   First reason, rebalancing.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.600]   Sometimes that's just a natural thing.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.120]   I don't think that's what you're asking in this question.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.400]   So we're going to put that aside.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.120]   The second reason is the point of investing is so you can live the life you want.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.160]   So sometimes you need to sell stuff just because, "Hey, I'm going on a vacation.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.560]   Maybe I want to do this or I want to do something nice for somebody."
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.280]   You sell.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.960]   I also assume that's not what you're asking either.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.840]   So we're going to put that aside.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.160]   So rebalancing and funding your lifestyle, let's put those aside reasons to sell.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.040]   The third reason I think you should sell is to get out of a concentrated or losing position.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.160]   Those are very different things because it's amplifying your risk.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.720]   It depends.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.080]   Let's say you work at a company, right?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.880]   You can think of that company paying you stuff as like a bond income.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.760]   That's like the income you're getting from the company is like a bond.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.480]   It's just a payment, right?
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.920]   You get every 2 weeks, you get your payment, right?
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.120]   Your coupon payment.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.720]   Now, why would you also want to hold the equity?
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.800]   You're like, "But Nick, this would be the next big thing."
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.680]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.280]   I recommend finding what is called the regret minimization framework.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.400]   That's not something I came up with.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.840]   But basically, sell enough of it so that you can lock up some level of lifestyle.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.880]   And then anything above that, if you want to let it ride, go ahead.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.640]   I want you to imagine the future.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   If it goes to zero, how do you feel?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.000]   If it triples, how do you feel?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.080]   So sell the amount, the right amount such that no matter how the future unfolds,
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.760]   you're kind of happy with your decision.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.120]   I think that's the best way to do it.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.200]   I think it's the only prudent way to do it because someone close to me, they went public.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.720]   He saw his net worth shoot up a lot of money, talking high six figures.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.240]   And he was in a high growth tech stock.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.880]   And now that company has collapsed by like 80%.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.120]   So he's now seen his wealth drop.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   And now that six-figure position is still six figures, but now it's very low six figures.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.360]   So he's seen this happen because he didn't want to sell any of it
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.120]   because he thought it was gonna be the next big thing.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.400]   And I think he's having some regret
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.680]   because he should have sold probably some of it to lock up some lifestyle stuff.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.240]   And I just said, "Hey, here's what I would do, but you can do whatever you want."
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.280]   And then they did what they wanted.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.000]   And that's it now.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.800]   So that's what to just think about is like regret minimization.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.920]   That's the framework I would use.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.160]   So let's say you're holding one of those stocks.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.600]   And right now, it's down more than the market is on average, right?
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.720]   There are a handful of tickers that are down, like you said, 80%.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.240]   Is there an argument to stay in them?
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.160]   Because if the whole market recovers,
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.840]   they're gonna recover at a rate that is maybe greater than the average market.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.720]   If you just trade out of, I don't know, Peloton or Robinhood or something into the S&P,
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.440]   everything comes back to normal.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.640]   Well, you went down 70% and now you're just up 20%.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.120]   Is the argument stay in them?
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.960]   Is it stay to something diversified but closer to that profile?
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.040]   Nasdaq tech index fund or something like that?
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.480]   How do you think about when you lost a large percent diversifying
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.080]   into something that probably won't recover at the same rate if it recovers?
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.960]   Yeah. So that's the thing.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.160]   You don't know if it's going to recover.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.640]   So the only thing you can use is historical data.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.680]   If you look at the one-year median return across any individual stock,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.560]   I was using the Compustat database going to 1976.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.000]   The one-year return is like 6%.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.960]   And the one-year return on an index is 9%.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.200]   The probability that you're going to have one of these stocks,
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.440]   it's going to have one of these returns, it's going to do better is low.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.360]   So it's more likely you're going to underperform.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.000]   If we're picking stocks out of a hat, you're probably going to underperform.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.320]   I hear your argument, but look, these ones are like high beta.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.400]   So like when the stock market dips and they dip more,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.320]   but when the stock market comes back, they come back more.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.400]   Well, maybe that was true in this last run because tech was really high
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.120]   and everything was going well, but now maybe things have changed.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.840]   I can't give you an answer that's going to satisfy you because I'd be like,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.200]   "Oh yeah, of course they're going to come back."
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.920]   The thing I like to think about is all the prices in the past
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.960]   could have just been imaginary.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   We were all very bullish on tech and like, "Oh, COVID is taking over the world
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.120]   and we're never going to come out of our houses and this is everything."
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.320]   Like Zoom and Peloton, all these companies are now the future, right?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.840]   And now that the world's kind of coming back to reality, like maybe that's not true.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.200]   And so maybe all those prices were like kind of imaginary in some respect.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.600]   So I don't know if we're going to see something like that.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.800]   Then again, like I know it's crazy to say that we go to another pandemic
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.480]   and then those companies start to thrive again.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.560]   I just don't know, like the future is so uncertain.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.200]   I mean, it's really tough to be in that space when you're down 80%.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.720]   You have to just evaluate it going forward.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.640]   I would say evaluate on risk parameters and not necessarily trying to get all your money back
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   because you should just assume you're not going to.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.960]   So what I'm doing, for example, I own two tech stocks.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.760]   I won't say what they are.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.120]   I'm not trying to pump them or anything.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.720]   But at the end of the year, if they're still down bad,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.400]   I'm going to sell them and just have them as a tax loss.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.840]   I'm holding through the end of this year.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   And if like, if they come back, they do.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.160]   If they don't at all, I'm selling at the end of this year regardless.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.600]   And I'm just going to lock in the tax loss
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   because I can write that off against other gains.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.200]   So that's kind of how I look at it.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.320]   That's a good strategy.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.840]   Maybe I'm going to adopt that strategy for a handful of these small positions.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.280]   You mentioned income producing assets.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.200]   What about the other side of that equation?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.520]   Crypto or art or anything like that?
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.440]   Where do those things fit into investing?
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.640]   I hold roughly 10% of my investable assets in those different types of
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.160]   what I call non-income producing assets.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.480]   So that actually does include mostly art and crypto.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.160]   And I actually also put private companies,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.080]   even though companies could be income producing.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.680]   I don't consider them income producing.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.520]   I have a couple of very small private investments,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.360]   like 1% of my net worth or something.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.720]   And those aren't income producing, right?
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.240]   I always look at it like that.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.120]   And when the price is based completely on what people are willing to pay for it,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.760]   and then there's no income, you kind of have to look at it that way.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.040]   So I'm not saying you can't make money in them,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.400]   and they're not good for risk reasons or a host of other things.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.800]   But I just think you need to keep it a smaller portion of your portfolio,
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.000]   because it's really hard to show how those are going to keep
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.080]   going up in value in the same way that income producing assets go up in value.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.360]   There's a much more fundamental reasoning for why those should go up
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.200]   in value versus why art or crypto or anything else should go up in value.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.840]   That makes sense.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.560]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.360]   I get it.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.960]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.040]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.960]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly,
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.640]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.520]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.280]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.640]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.240]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.880]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.760]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.440]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.480]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer,
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.960]   wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.880]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week,
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.480]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.080]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.960]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.000]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.760]   So let's jump a little bit to where we put the money.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.560]   I think one of your contrarian takes in the book
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.840]   is that maybe you shouldn't max out your 401k.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.240]   Yes, that's one of my most contrarian takes.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.160]   I think it's a very disliked take, but some people see the value in it.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.120]   For someone listening, it's like, "Wait a second. Wait a second. I've got my 401k."
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.680]   Let's set aside the match because I think we'll all agree that
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.480]   if your company is going to match your contributions, that's worth it.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.640]   But if they're not, why would someone listening who's not getting matched
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.440]   want to stop and say, "Maybe I shouldn't do this"?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.280]   Well, I think the point of this is to actually just open the conversation up.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.400]   Because if I looked and I was like, "9 out of 9 personal finance experts all said max your 401k."
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.480]   I was like, "Maybe I should just look into the numbers and find out."
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.120]   And you actually look at the after-tax savings you get from above the match, as you said.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.480]   So anything above the employer match was something like 0.7% a year.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.280]   That's assuming a 15% capital gains rate and a bunch of other assumptions.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.840]   You're looking at 0.7% a year and some 401k plans have all-in fees of over 1%.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.800]   Those people are paying 1% to be in their 401k.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.520]   They're getting -0.3% a year tax.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.760]   They're paying a negative tax alpha, I guess you'd call it.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.000]   You're losing money just to be in their 401k.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.640]   They would be better off if they didn't put any money in there and just held that
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.400]   on the outside and put it in a brokerage account and got lower fee options.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.080]   So they could just manage it themselves.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.040]   And so I just wanted to open this up so that people would actually look at their
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.040]   401ks and say, "How much am I actually paying?"
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.240]   The all-in fees, everything.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.320]   If it's anywhere near, let's say, 0.7%, you need to definitely get out of there.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.960]   If it's like 0.5%, then the question is like, "Is it worth the extra 0.2% a year
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.600]   to lock up your money to 59 and a half?"
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.200]   And I don't know for all the excess money.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.240]   And I don't know what the answer is.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.920]   So I wrote about all this in the book.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.240]   I was just comparing a 401k to a brokerage account where it's post-tax money and all this.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.200]   What I didn't even consider and I've since thought about since,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.000]   in a brokerage account, if your only income is capital gains,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.360]   like dividends, capital gains, whatever, and that's your only income for the year,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.720]   you can have $40,000 a year tax-free as a single individual.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.280]   If you include the standard deduction right now, it's like 50 grand.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.760]   So if you're a couple, now multiply that by two, a couple, a retired couple right now,
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.240]   let's say they have, I don't know, a $2 million portfolio,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.800]   and it's paying them $100,000 a year in income, like capital gains, dividends, etc.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.080]   And that's the only income they have there.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.680]   No social security, nothing else.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.640]   They can have 0% tax on all that money.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.680]   No taxes.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.520]   So now if you use that, if you just have a well-managed brokerage account,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.000]   that completely destroys maxing out a 401k because you're not putting money,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.760]   locking it up to 59 and a half.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.960]   It just makes absolutely no sense to do that when you can have a 0% tax-free
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.240]   pulling money out of your brokerage account, which is kind of wild to think about.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.040]   But that's like a real thing.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.960]   You can look it up, like, yes, a couple can pull out about $100,000 a year tax-free,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.920]   as long as their only income is capital gains.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.760]   And most people don't talk about that.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.920]   And that's something that now going back,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.240]   I would have added that into the book as another counter argument.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.760]   But just think about that.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.840]   That completely changes the retirement landscape.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.440]   I'm like, "Do you need to max 401k?"
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.480]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.920]   Because if you can build a big enough portfolio outside of your 401k,
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.560]   you can even do it and have a much better tax treatment as well.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.760]   I had Andy Ratcliffe, who started Wealthfront, where I work on the show.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.320]   He has a similar take to you, but he added on.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.520]   And so go back and listen to that episode if you want to go deeper on this.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.800]   The cost of the liquidity, the fact that if you need the money,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.920]   you have to pay fees.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.480]   And there isn't an easy way to get the money out.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.360]   And his argument was that young people, you don't know what you're going to need money for,
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.480]   whether it's starting a company, whether it's buying a home, whether something happens.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.000]   And so his point was like, "If the fees don't make sense,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.680]   then it's a no-brainer that you shouldn't do it."
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.160]   And there are sites out there right now where I think you could just search 401k fee analysis.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.800]   And they'll tell you, sometimes it's the account fee,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.360]   sometimes it's these mutual funds that just get marked up.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.400]   It's like you could get the same fund somewhere else, but we just charge you
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.920]   an extra half a percent.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.800]   But there's also a cost to liquidity and not having access to your money if you need it.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.440]   If you're not a good saver, maybe that's actually a benefit.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.000]   Maybe if you can't access your money, it's probably better for you.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.160]   But if you are a good saver, I think that's another factor that plays into it.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.760]   And I think so some people say locking up your money is a feature, not a bug.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.600]   And I agree for some people that don't have discipline.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.080]   This is not going to be a great idea because you're going to pull that money out and then
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.200]   probably spend it or something.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   So I completely understand that take.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.960]   There's some benefits that go beyond a spreadsheet.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.240]   But yeah, that's why I even thought about looking into the numbers on this,
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.720]   because I was like, I had the same issue where like,
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.320]   "Oh, wow, I couldn't buy real estate right now because like I locked up way too much
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.000]   money into my 401k that I probably should have just done the 4%, got my match,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.600]   and then had everything else on the outside."
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.440]   And I kind of regret that now.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.960]   That's why I'm just trying to get this idea to people, especially young people who like,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.560]   "You're right. You don't know what you're going to use the money for."
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.960]   And so just having that kind of in mind is kind of helpful, I think.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.720]   If you want to have a diverse portfolio, maybe there's some assets you put in your
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.440]   retirement account, some you put in your Roth IRA, some you put in your taxable account.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.000]   And for someone versed in asset location, is that really a big deal?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.120]   I think I saw somewhere that you either don't do it or it's not an
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.960]   important part of your investing strategy, which made me question whether it's worth it.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.880]   There's 2 different ways of looking at it.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.640]   If you're trying to maximize every dollar, there's an optimal way to do it.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.040]   And I can tell you, you want to put your highest growth assets,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.160]   the things you think are going to grow the fastest, let's say stocks.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.720]   Let's say there's only 2 assets. There's stocks, which are high growth.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.640]   And let's say they're bond, which are low growth.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.960]   In that scenario, you would put all your high growth assets into your non-taxable accounts.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.640]   Your 401(k) would be all stocks. Your IRAs would be all stocks.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.000]   And then your bonds would sit in your taxable accounts where you have to pay
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.360]   whatever on the income that you're saying.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.720]   But Nick, they pay the income, but if you actually look at the math, the high growth,
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.840]   all the taxes on the capital gains are going to be much bigger than any sort of income you're
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.560]   going to have to pay on a bond, especially with yields as low as they are today.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.920]   The income is very small.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.880]   So if you're trying to just go like maximize every dollar,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.800]   there is an asset location argument to be made.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.360]   But if you want to do a convenience argument, which is what I care about,
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.680]   I just make all my accounts look basically the same, right?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.200]   Like they're like carbon copies of each other in terms of the asset allocation.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.040]   I don't put the same funds in all of them.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.160]   The reason I don't is because I do tax-loss harvesting once in a while.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.240]   This is where you kind of need a professional sometimes.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.400]   If you don't do that correctly, you can do something called a wash sale.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.200]   And basically you try to tax-loss harvest, like lock in a loss.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.400]   But then if you buy something like one of your IRAs, you buy the same thing.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.360]   It's all washed.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   It's a very complex topic.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.400]   I don't want to get into here.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.960]   I just recommend talking to a professional and getting that type of advice.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.840]   Because if you're trying to do certain types of tax games in there,
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.360]   you're going to have to just be careful what you do.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.280]   But just for ease of use, I like having the same allocation across all my accounts.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.960]   Because then rebalancing is much easier.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.800]   Because I can rebalance within an account, right?
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.000]   If I have all my stocks in one account and all the bonds in another account,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.560]   how do I get the money out of the 401(k) and into my brokerage?
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.600]   You can't do that, right?
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.560]   So for a host of reasons, I recommend the carbon copy model,
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.480]   cookie-cutter model of asset allocation.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.160]   When it comes to tax-loss harvesting, one of the saddest emails I've ever gotten was
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.000]   from people while I was working at Wealthfront.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.040]   They're like, "Gosh, I've been running three RoboAdvisor portfolios and tax-loss
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.640]   harvesting on all of them."
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.960]   Which effectively meant they're buying and selling the same index funds to optimize their taxes.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.080]   But three people completely uncoordinated are doing it.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.800]   And the end result is just not going to be fun.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.920]   I always say, "If you are doing any kind of tax-loss harvesting,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.160]   make sure that whoever's doing it knows all the rules across all the accounts.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.600]   Otherwise, it can be messy."
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.120]   Even just the investing of it, right?
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.720]   If you are investing regularly in your IRA, like you said,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.160]   if you're buying the same thing, your tax-loss harvesting somewhere else can be a problem.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.800]   The single feature that I thought was the coolest is in Wealthfront,
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.760]   you can go in and put an email address and they have to confirm, I think.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.600]   But so my wife and I each have an account.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.800]   If we put our email addresses in Wealthfront, we'll link them up
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.000]   and tax-loss harvest accordingly across all the accounts.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.680]   So there's software that can do it.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.040]   There are advisors that can do it.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.680]   You could do it once a year where you know everything's happening.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.240]   But if you're trying to play the tax games, I'm with you.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.640]   You just got to be careful because the tax games all go away if you mess it up.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.360]   Yeah. Especially if you're tax-loss harvesting, I'd recommend
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.760]   do not automatically reinvest your dividends.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.520]   That's also another nightmare because you could sell out of a position and then
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.680]   it automatically reinvests and starts to wash.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.640]   That's another wash sale thing where you now don't get the tax loss at all.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.680]   You got to be really careful.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.480]   We could do a whole episode just on that because I've made all the mistakes now.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.240]   And I know all the things to look out for.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.920]   But it's so complex that I agree.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.280]   You need like one person in the so-called driver's seat,
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.200]   trying to figure out all the accounts and everything.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.280]   Otherwise, you're going to wash sale yourself.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.640]   It's not a matter of if, but when.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.600]   You got to be really careful.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.320]   Or like you said, a hack there would be just have a different set of funds.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.640]   If you are investing in 2 different accounts and you don't want to have to deal with that,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.400]   just pick a different set of index funds in each account so you're not at risk.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   Yeah, exactly. Also, all my non-taxables are identical because I can
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.760]   do whatever and I'm not going to get any sort of wash sale because they're all non-tax.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.520]   My IRAs, 401ks, etc.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.200]   But then all my brokerage stuff is a completely separate set of funds.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.280]   There's no overlap there because I don't want any sort of accidents to happen, so to speak.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.880]   Now, we talked a lot about investing and a lot of the book is about saving.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.360]   And I did want to touch on one thing where
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.960]   you talk a little bit about how some people early on might be focusing too much on investing
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.320]   when they should be focused on saving.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:25.880]   Why is that?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.600]   Let's just do some simple math here.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.120]   It'll illustrate it instantly, right?
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.520]   Imagine you have $1,000 to your name, right?
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.520]   You're 22 years old like I was or 23.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.200]   I'm like, "Hey, I'm starting investing.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.520]   I spent all this time analyzing my investments and all this."
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.280]   Let's say you get a 10% return.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.880]   That's $100, right?
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.560]   At the same time, when I was 23, I was out in San Francisco with friends.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.360]   We'd go to dinner, have drinks, Uber home, all that.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.560]   I easily was spending $100 in a single night.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.880]   Me foregoing one night going out with my friends was the same as my investment return for a year.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.640]   So you can see when you don't have a lot of capital to invest, especially younger people,
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.000]   people who are just starting, it's not going to matter what your investments do.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.640]   That's the sad truth.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.360]   No one wants to talk about it, but it's not really going to matter what happens.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.000]   And once you start building that nest egg, then it does.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.160]   And so you can see generally over someone's life.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.080]   The phrase I like to use in the chapter one in the book is called "savings for the poor
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.440]   and investments for the rich."
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.680]   I don't mean poor in an absolute way.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.320]   It could be true in an absolute way, but I really mean in a relative way.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.280]   If you're young, you're probably poor relative to your future self, right?
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.680]   You're assuming you're going to have a career, save money, etc.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.720]   You need to focus more on your income, your savings, things like that.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.280]   And as you get older, you can spend a lot more time on investments.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.960]   That doesn't mean you shouldn't read books on investing.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.000]   I'm not anti-knowledge.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.640]   Of course not.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.720]   Of course, I want people to learn more about this stuff.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.360]   But you don't need to spend a ton of time on it, at least initially.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.560]   Just set something up.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.000]   If you, "Oh, should I be in a target date?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   Should I do this?"
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.040]   It's not going to matter that much if you're 22 or 23.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.840]   It's really not.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.160]   But as you start to learn more about stuff, start saving up more money,
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.520]   then your investment decisions matter.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.960]   Because now let's do the flip side.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.080]   Let's say you have a $10 million portfolio and it declines by 10%.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.360]   That's $1 million.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.520]   Someone that could save $1 million after tax, you have to have a very high-paying job.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   There's very few people that can do something like that.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.360]   So you can see, once you have a big portfolio, investing is kind of the whole game.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.840]   Your income is not going to be able to do much to budge that.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   But your investment knowledge and what you do and what you own really matters a lot more.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.760]   So just think about, where do you have the most leverage?
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.240]   The best hack I know is take what your time and attention
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.000]   and focus on the area where you have the most leverage.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.400]   When you're 22, when you're young, it's your career.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.760]   And as you get older, and assuming you have more wealth, it's your investments.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.880]   And so figuring out where you are on that spectrum is what's important.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.560]   So the little rule I like to use is just figure out how much you could save in the next year.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.440]   That's some number.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.320]   Let's say $10,000.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.680]   Figure out how much your investments can return you in the next year.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.480]   Let's say in a good year, you can get a 10% return.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.080]   Let's just use that number for fun.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.520]   10% return.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.840]   Unless you have $50,000 invested, that's $5,000.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.560]   So if you could save $10,000, but your investments can only earn you $5,000,
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.600]   you probably need to work a little bit more on either raising your income
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.240]   or saving more money to get that other number higher.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.440]   You want that $50,000 to be $100,000 and then $200,000, etc.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.040]   So that if it gets a 10% return, the amount of income you're going to get is larger.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.960]   So whatever number is bigger is where you need to focus on.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.120]   Because over time, you're going to see that your investments
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.360]   are going to be able to return you more than you can save in a year,
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.120]   in theory, if everything goes well.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.080]   So that's what they're focused on.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   And so let's go down that journey.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.560]   Now you're at the point your investments are earning you more, that second half of the journey.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.960]   And you're in a situation where I know a lot of people are...
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.120]   Which is they're struggling to spend money.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.840]   They've gone through this disciplined cycle of saving.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.920]   And now... And maybe they're not all the way there.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.400]   Maybe they're still saving more than they would earn in their investments.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.680]   But they're struggling because they don't want to spend money.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.320]   I know so many people that have that guilt and anxiety.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.880]   Myself, my wife included, where we're trying to feel comfortable spending money.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.760]   Because after all, what is all the money for,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.720]   if we're not able to actually use it on the things we want?
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.000]   But people who adopt a diligent savings habits sometimes struggle here.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.080]   Yeah. So this is a problem that a lot of people have,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.240]   especially people who are affluent, who have done well.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   Because by definition, the people that have a lot of money have probably...
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.400]   Besides the people who got lucky, let's put them aside,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   have probably had pretty good savings habits.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.960]   So it's like you're actually really good at acquiring money,
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.320]   and you're not really good at spending.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.240]   So by definition, it's going to be difficult.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.600]   That's the first thing to realize.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.960]   It's not going to be easy for you.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   I think the second thing to recognize is a lot of this comes from guilt.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.840]   Whether you're guilting yourself, or you're seeing the media guilt people,
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.840]   or maybe your social circles would be guilting you.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.800]   I don't know what it is.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.640]   And every person is going to be different.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.880]   It's figuring out how to get past that guilt.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.480]   I'm not saying that, "Oh, if you have a lot of money,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.520]   you should be spending a lot of money."
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.480]   That's not my argument here.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.160]   But I'm saying you should be comfortable spending money when you need to, right?
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.600]   I don't want you to spend money frivolously.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.040]   I don't think that's good for anybody.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.240]   But if you're like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.480]   I don't know if I should buy these nice dress shoes,
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.120]   because my other ones, they're fine, but they're getting old."
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.720]   And if you're worried about $200 purchase,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.000]   and you're worth $2 million or $5 million in net worth,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.640]   you need to get something psychologically figured out.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.560]   Why are you feeling that way about spending money?
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.960]   And sometimes it is from stuff you can't change.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.440]   For example, I go out and spend a lot of money at restaurants.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.960]   That's the thing I like to do.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.360]   But at the same time, every time I go to McDonald's,
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.800]   I still order off the dollar menu,
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.760]   because that's what my mom and dad always had me order off as a kid.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.160]   And there's this weird thing where I can't get over it.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.040]   I can go drop $60 on a dry aged rib eye steak,
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.080]   but there's something about me spending $5 on a McDonald's sandwich
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.080]   that's going to mess with me mentally.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.520]   And so I don't know why that is.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.720]   And so you got to figure out what in my psychology is making me do that,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.520]   and what in your psychology is making you behave the way that you are.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.240]   Tips to do it.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.640]   I would say, if you want to spend, I have a rule I use.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.600]   It's called the 2X rule.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.360]   If you're going to splurge on something,
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.960]   let's say you're going to spend $500 on some fancy watch or handbag or whatever.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.840]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.000]   Take another $500 and either invest it or donate to a good cause.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.200]   Now you can get rid of your guilt saying,
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   "Every time I spend on myself, I'm also donating."
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.120]   So now, yes, you're going to be spending more money,
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.720]   but at least you can get rid of that guilt
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.440]   and spend it towards something that you care about in some other way.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.040]   So that's another way of doing it.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.920]   You can try and do that.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.320]   It doesn't work for everyone, but I've heard some good results from it so far.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.360]   And you said you could also invest it.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.440]   So if you're investing it, you're not giving it away.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.200]   You're just setting it aside for the future.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.160]   For your future self, yeah.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.120]   I just want to thank you, Quik, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.920]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.040]   Can you talk a little bit about what you call the biggest lie in personal finance?
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.840]   Yeah, so what I think is the biggest lie in personal finance
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.200]   is that cutting spending is a reliable path to building wealth.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.240]   And I just don't think the data suggests that at all.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.360]   Yes, you can cut spending.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.360]   It's like a short-term workaround, but it doesn't build wealth of the long run.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.240]   Just consider this.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:37.880]   Very simple.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.720]   If you look at the data, one of the most positively correlated things with savings rate
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.640]   is your income, your absolute level of income.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.320]   And you're going to say, "Well, Nick, this is so obvious."
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.040]   Well, it's so obvious, but yet people are still pushing this cutting spending argument, right?
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.000]   It's like people with higher incomes generally save more money.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.200]   That is just across the board.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.160]   The higher rate, they're even saving a higher percentage of their income.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.200]   And the reason is simple.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.760]   Incomes go up, but your spending doesn't move with it, right?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.800]   It's like law of the stomach.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.840]   If I increase your income 10x, are you going to spend 10 times more on food?
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.560]   Probably not.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.480]   Are you going to spend 10 times more on housing?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.520]   Maybe, but probably not.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.960]   Maybe you'll spend 8 times more on housing.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.280]   I don't know.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.840]   But you see people generally earn more and more money.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.280]   They don't spend more and more.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.880]   And you're like, "But Nick, I know this person has high income.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.440]   They spend a lot."
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.560]   Yes, you know these people.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.280]   You know a handful.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.240]   You can think of anecdotes.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.680]   I know people like that too.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.600]   But the data suggests, if you're looking across aggregated data sets across most people,
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.360]   that that is just not true.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.720]   And I'm sorry to burst the bubble.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.160]   But it's just not in there.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.000]   And if you want to bring other data sets that show this, I'd be happy to look at them.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.960]   But I have not seen any data sets that show that people of higher income are spending
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.280]   money at a higher rate than people of lower income.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.640]   So I think it really shows that really the way to get rich in the long run, the most
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.880]   reliable path, it does take longer, is to raise your income and find other income opportunities.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.080]   Work on your career, whatever.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.160]   Work on a side hustle that becomes a main hustle, whatever.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.760]   There's a lot of ways to do this.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.280]   But it's what I recommend.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.200]   And you like break down each one of those.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.000]   Yeah. Chapter 3, I talk about different ways you can raise your income.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.160]   If you really need that type of stuff, there's different ways of doing it.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.920]   Whether it's like selling a product, whether it's like selling a skill or service, teaching
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.160]   people.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.920]   There's a lot of different ways you can do this.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.280]   And what mine is just like a limited set just to kind of get your ideas flowing if you need
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:10.600]   that help.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.800]   But that's really the only way out as I see it.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.360]   Cool.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.240]   I think another big thing, and you talked about this, is that as you build more wealth,
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:19.960]   it doesn't matter.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.720]   You're never going to feel rich.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.760]   I don't want to get into that paradigm because I know we've talked about it a lot.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.960]   But I am curious if you have any stories, anecdotes, or tips for people who are in that
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.920]   boat where they're like, "Gosh, I feel like I'm at a place where I thought when I got
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.960]   here, I'd be great.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.880]   And now I just feel exactly like I did 1 year, 5 years, 10 years ago."
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.640]   I think the easiest way to do it is to remember where you came from.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.280]   Have an absolute measure of wealth.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.920]   For example, if you have over $100,000 in Liquid Net Worth, that puts you in the top
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.880]   10% of people on the planet in terms of how rich you are.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.000]   I would say that's considered rich.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And you're saying, "Nick, that's ridiculous.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.360]   You can't compare me to some random personnel out there in the world.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.000]   That's not fair."
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.160]   But in the book, I talk about this.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.520]   Lloyd Blankfein, the ex-CEO of Goldman Sachs, was interviewed about this.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.800]   They asked him just about his life.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.840]   And he's like, "I don't feel rich.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.480]   I'm well-to-do."
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.200]   Even though he's a billionaire.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.080]   This person's a billionaire.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:11.720]   He says, "I'm not rich.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.200]   I'm well-to-do."
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.120]   And you're saying like, "That's a ridiculous argument.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.600]   How can you say, Lloyd Blankfein, that you're not rich?"
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.880]   Well, because he's hanging out with people like David Geffen and Jeff Bezos,
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.640]   and people who have 10, 100x his wealth.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.400]   So he doesn't feel rich relative to them.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.480]   Well, I can make the same argument that like, "Hey."
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.920]   I know what he's saying is outlandish.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.200]   But what you're saying about how like, "Oh, well, you can't compare me to those
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.320]   other people around the world."
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:33.960]   It's the same thing.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.480]   Lloyd Blankfein doesn't think that you can compare him to people like you and me, right?
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.640]   Because he's like, "That's not my social circle, right?
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.520]   Those aren't my people."
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.760]   So you're making the same argument he's making.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.280]   Obviously, it's less objectively outrageous, but it's the same argument.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.040]   So I think you have to look at global wealth.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.920]   You have to look at like, absolute thing relative to your history,
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.720]   what you could expect to earn or expect to have in your life.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.080]   I think that's the only way to stay grateful and to kind of break out of that cycle of
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.800]   not feeling rich.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.280]   Like, for example, I consider myself rich.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.080]   I'm not a millionaire.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   Like, objectively, in the United States, I'm not rich.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.720]   But like, relative to the world, I consider myself rich.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.400]   And so I have to think like that.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.960]   Otherwise, I will always be chasing that type of stuff.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.640]   And so I think you have to remember that.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.600]   That's how you ground yourself.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.040]   So I would consider myself a rich person, despite the fact that I'm not even a
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.760]   millionaire.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.720]   I'm not someone who can go around and fly private or any of that type of stuff,
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.400]   which we would consider rich behavior.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.080]   I think it's just a way of like looking at the world so that I don't kind of lose
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.600]   myself, that type of stuff.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:31.400]   Taking out of your mind that flying private is rich behavior is probably going to help
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.440]   because I feel like most of us will probably never get to that point.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.160]   We did have an episode where we talked about how you might be able to do it for a little
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:37.640]   bit less.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.120]   But no matter how you slice it, it's just really expensive.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.840]   So don't put that as a target or a goal.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.320]   You can always use points and fly business class for way less.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.240]   So I think most people here know that.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:54.840]   So you ended the book talking about this experiment where you said, "If I were able
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.880]   to create some principles that I would give to myself, if I were randomly dropped somewhere
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:04.280]   in the last 100 years, what would I create if those principles weren't like avoid the
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.680]   stock market during a certain time period or something?"
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.960]   And you said that was the book.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:12.520]   The idea was you wanted to write this book, I assume, for anyone at any point in time
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.000]   to read.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.240]   But there were 21 principles.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.520]   So I'm curious if you had to pick only a couple, what would they be?
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.640]   We just discussed one of them.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.560]   You'll never feel rich and that's okay.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:26.040]   I think that's a huge principle because throughout history, like status is always going to be
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.160]   something that affects humans.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.840]   It's going to be something true today, 100 years from now, 1000 years from now.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.040]   I know that's going to be true, right?
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.520]   I don't know what the investment environment is going to look like, whether we're going
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.320]   to have investments.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.080]   You go back a couple hundred years, investing wasn't a thing that people did, especially
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.120]   like regular people did.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.480]   It was something that maybe the rich did or governments did, but regular people wouldn't
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:43.960]   do that.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.920]   You're never going to feel rich.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.720]   That's one thing.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:50.360]   If I had to guess, I would assume markets on average will keep going up into the right
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.840]   over the very long term, like there's going to be human growth.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.320]   I think capitalism will survive despite all the critiques against it, which means if that's
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   true, then buy quickly, sell slowly.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.400]   That is a kind of an idea I had for thinking about how to invest in markets.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:03.960]   Don't wait.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.480]   Don't sit in cash forever trying to wait and trying to find the right time, those market
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:07.960]   timing things.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.680]   So that's like an overarching point of my work.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.280]   That's another big one I'd put out there.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.160]   I know there's a lot of money things we can talk about, but I think a lot of the things
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.600]   that affect people is more about their life.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.440]   So that's why I talk about not feeling rich.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.400]   But in addition, figure out not where you're going to retire from, but where you're going
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.440]   to retire to.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.280]   That's what's really important in retirement.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.160]   A lot of people think retirement is about money and all this, and don't get me wrong,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.360]   money is a piece of it.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:33.160]   But I think the existential crisis of retirement is a far bigger thing that people do not talk
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:33.400]   about.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.760]   And it's literally a big life change.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.440]   You go from going into an office every day or talking with people, whatever you're doing
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.640]   to now you don't do that anymore.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.160]   You have to fill that entire 40 hour week with other things.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.680]   And I think a lot of people aren't ready for that.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.600]   And it really hits them in a bad way.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.880]   So before you figure out what you're going to retire from, figure out what you're going
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.600]   to retire to.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.040]   Really imagine your retirement.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.440]   Figure out what type of activities you're going to do with who, how often, et cetera.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.680]   Like, is that going to be with family, with friends, whatever?
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.640]   I think we should put a lot more emphasis on that because I think that's going to have
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:07.000]   a bigger impact on people's well-being than whether they can use the 4% rule or the 3%
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.240]   rule.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.000]   I don't think money is the primary concern for most people in retirement.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.920]   And I think my book has illustrated that.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.400]   If you read chapter 2, it talks about that at length.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.600]   So if I had to give a couple principles, the market timing one, because it's kind of my
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.040]   bread and butter what I talk about.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.320]   I say the feeling rich thing because I think a lot of people don't focus on that.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   And then same with the retirement thing.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.600]   Thinking about much...
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.280]   Think beyond money when it comes to retirement.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.560]   Those are the 3 big ones I give out.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   I know that from our conversation outside of this interview, you have some life hacks,
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.360]   some tricks, some tactics, some routines that are worth sharing that have nothing to do
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.880]   with personal finance or investing.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.320]   So I'm curious, while we have you, what some of your top ones are.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:49.160]   If you live in a city where they have laundry services, I recommend getting your laundry
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:49.400]   done.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.200]   Just taking it in there, have them pick up, deliver.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.640]   I actually have a friend who lives in Long Island, so he gets to drive it in and stuff.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   And he's like, "It's the greatest thing I've ever done."
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.080]   It's because it saves you time and it's so low cost relative to your time.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.280]   I hate folding clothes.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.720]   It's one of the best things I've ever done.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.400]   I feel like every time I spend my money there, I'm getting a bargain relative to doing my
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.120]   laundry by hand.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.480]   Especially if you have a wife and kids or husband and children, whatever it is.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.240]   That's a ton of clothing.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.000]   You have to physically wash it, dry it, sort it out, fold it.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.880]   It's just so much time and mental energy, especially if you're really busy.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.760]   Having someone else just do that and getting it delivered all full and you just got to
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   put it in a drawer is so much easier.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.720]   So that's my first hack.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.480]   Have someone else do your laundry if you can.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.440]   If there's an area where you have laundry services, I think it's probably one of the
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.640]   most undervalued things out there.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.440]   That's one.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.680]   Another thing, this is a travel hack I use.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.960]   I have duplicates of almost like, "Oh, I have to pack a toothbrush.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.520]   I have to pack this.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.240]   I have to pack..."
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:39.640]   Nope.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.360]   I have everything already sitting in my suitcase ready to go.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.200]   The only thing I have to still pack is clothing because weather does change.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.160]   If I'm in Seattle, it's very different than I'm in Phoenix, especially if I'm different
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.360]   in Boston and when I'm going.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.920]   So I do have to pack clothing, but everything else I have and I need on a trip is already
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.720]   in my suitcases.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   I never say, "Oh, did I forget my toothbrush?"
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.400]   Zero percent chance because it's already in there.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.720]   On top of that, if you do, something happens.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.160]   Let's say your razor runs out of...
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.360]   The blades go bad or something.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.320]   I don't have a backup razor.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:05.720]   Yeah, you do.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.920]   It's in your travel bag, right?
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.720]   So you already have it.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.800]   Thinking more about redundancy is really important because it just reduces your risk.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.720]   I used to forget, "Oh, God, I forgot my razor.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.080]   Oh, I forgot my deodorant.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.120]   I forgot this or that."
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:16.360]   Never.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.720]   I've never forgotten a thing since.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.440]   So double pack.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.640]   You're saying, "I have to buy everything twice."
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.320]   I'm telling you it's worth the cost to do it once and you'll never have to think about
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:23.640]   it again.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.000]   So if I could, I would actually have a whole wardrobe ready to pack, but that's really
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.760]   hard to do and you're not going to know where you're going to go.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.640]   So you can't do that.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.040]   But I would say just have backups and travel.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.520]   Awesome.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.720]   Okay, I have one more hack.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.160]   The biggest hack I've ever done in my life, maybe the greatest decision of my life.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.240]   So I applied to a very selective school.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.440]   I got into Stanford.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.240]   So I'd apply early where if I got in early, I basically had to go.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.480]   And so I couldn't apply anywhere else early.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.200]   But I was looking at the statistics and the acceptance rate my year to get into Stanford
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:50.840]   was 10%.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.040]   Very difficult, right?
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   But early acceptance was 18%.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.640]   It was double.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.600]   So don't get me wrong.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.640]   10% is very hard.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.040]   18% is still hard, but it's not as hard.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.120]   Today, those rates are half of that.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.560]   If you want to get your kid into a selective school and there's some sort of early program,
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.880]   I guarantee you the acceptance rate is higher.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.360]   And there's no single thing you can do to double your kid's chances of getting into
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.680]   a selective university than by having them apply early.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.200]   I don't care if they got a 2400.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.400]   I don't care if they're valedictorian.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:17.960]   I don't care.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.920]   You can go across the board.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.400]   There's not one single thing that's going to double their chances.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.640]   But that's a hack that probably will.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.640]   I bet if you look at the data now, it's still double.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.160]   I think the last time I checked, like now the standard acceptance rate is like 5%.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.600]   But if you apply early, it's 10.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.800]   It's like the easiest ARB out there.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.640]   Of course, you can probably only do this to one school.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.880]   But if you have one of these schools, you're like, "Hey, I want to go."
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.720]   Parents are spending all this money and all this stuff.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.000]   It's like, have them apply early.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.120]   That literally doubles their chance.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.680]   It makes no sense to me why this isn't being talked about more.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.120]   I should have seen a bunch of articles on this.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.080]   I have not seen it yet.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.840]   So that's my biggest life hack for trying to get your kids into a selective school.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.120]   So I hope that helps.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:55.000]   I hope it holds true a decade or two from now when my kids are actually going to school.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.200]   Everyone's short in college now.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.560]   So who knows, right?
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.320]   Well, one more thing I always like to end on is to pick a city you love
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.760]   and just give some people some suggestions who are visiting from out of town.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.280]   Places to eat, something to drink, something to do, anything in there.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.680]   So I'll give you some New York City stuff.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.400]   I'm a big foodie.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.440]   So I'm going to focus on that.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.760]   You can look up what's in New York City museums, etc.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.520]   I say find your interest and go after that.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   So big thing, food places, it really depends what you want exactly.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.120]   But I recommend one of the biggest brands in New York City is called Quality.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.400]   So Quality Eats, Quality Meats, Quality Bistro, Quality Italian.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.080]   There's a bunch of different restaurants here.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.480]   It's not like a chain like that, but it's like a restaurant group.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.920]   I think they have really good food.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.840]   It's more high-end, really fun.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.400]   If you like sushi, Sushi Seki is good.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.520]   If you want to do a Michelin star restaurant, my favorite is probably Momofuku Co.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.560]   That's really awesome.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.120]   Honestly, if you just have restaurant recommendations, just DM me on Twitter.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:44.840]   I'll just give them to you.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.440]   Just tell me what you're looking for, price range.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.000]   I'll just help you.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.960]   I love doing this for people.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.800]   It's just so awesome because I've been in the city a while.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.920]   In terms of bars, if you want just my favorite cocktail bar, it's a place called Olly.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   Just for the taste of the drinks, O-L-L-I-E, they are just so good.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.840]   It's in West Village in Manhattan.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.880]   Not the flashiest place here, but the drinks are just incredible.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.600]   If you want something that's more visually appealing and kind of fun,
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.960]   there's a place called Time Bar.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.520]   It's like a seated tasting type of thing, T-H-Y-M-E.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.320]   That's a really cool place.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.480]   And you'll be drinking out of what looks like an oyster shell.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.000]   It's just like a copper's porcelain,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.240]   but it looks like an oyster shell and all these different things.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.880]   You'll have smoke coming out of things and drinks hanging from the roof.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.400]   It's really weird stuff.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.040]   So, if you want to experience, that's probably a place I'd recommend.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.040]   Outside of that, trust me, just DM me if you want.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.800]   I'm on Twitter @DollarsAndData.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.720]   So, free food recs in NYC.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.000]   That's awesome.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.240]   Where else can people find you and the book?
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.240]   My website's of DollarsAndData.com.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   I said Twitter @DollarsAndData.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Book's going to be at Amazon, Barnes & Noble.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.440]   Just search, just keep buying.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.320]   You can find it there.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.240]   So, hope you guys enjoy it if you read it.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.360]   The book's fantastic.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.000]   I read it.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.840]   I love that half of the subtitles for every chapter is something contrarian to pull you
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.880]   in because I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.000]   I don't know if I buy that."
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.960]   And then I kept reading.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.640]   So, thank you for writing that.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.680]   And thank you for being here.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.400]   Yeah, appreciate it, Chris.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.120]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.640]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.400]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:06.360]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.960]   I would really appreciate it.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.880]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.120]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.160]   That's it for this week.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:27.640]   I'll see you next week.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
