[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   We come this evening to a consideration of the fifth verse in the seventh chapter of
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.960]   Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins which were by the law did work in
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.440]   our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   And really we must go on to verse 6, "But now we are delivered from the law, that being
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.960]   dead wherein we were held, that in order that we should serve in newness of spirit, and
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.440]   not in the oldness of the letter."
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   Now these two verses, as I say, really go together and constitute one statement.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.480]   The first in verse 5 is the negative aspect or the negative half of the statement, and
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.200]   then in verse 6 you have the positive half.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.480]   And obviously here in this statement the apostle is giving an explanation of something that
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.640]   he's already said.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.160]   The fifth verse begins with the word "for," and that at once lets us know that he's going
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.040]   to give an explanation.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.120]   And he's giving us an explanation of what he has just said in verse 4, which we've been
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120]   considering.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.840]   "Wherefore, my brethren, you also became dead to the law, or died to the Lord, by the body
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.040]   of Christ, that in order that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.440]   from the dead, in order that ye should bring forth fruit unto God."
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.960]   Now he is going to tell us why this marriage to Christ was an absolute necessity, and why,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.280]   incidentally, it was necessary prior to that that we should be dissolved from the marriage
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.000]   tie to the law which had gone before.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.280]   Now that's what he's doing in these two verses, this fifth verse and the sixth verse, which
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280]   follows.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120]   It's a very important statement for this reason.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.400]   The remainder of this seventh chapter, from verse 7 to the end, and indeed on into chapter
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.880]   8, is nothing but an elaboration of this statement in verses 5 and 6, so that clearly we are
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.600]   dealing with a very vital and a very crucial statement.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.160]   Here he puts it in general.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.760]   This is why we are to die to our marriage to the law and be married to Christ.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.880]   Here's the reason.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   He states it as a whole.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   And then you see from verse 7 he goes on to consider objections to this statement.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   And furthermore, he also works out what he says here in very great detail, in order to
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.400]   establish the statement to the full and beyond any doubt whatsoever.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.500]   Very well.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   This is his method.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.320]   We've seen it so often, haven't we?
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.440]   He makes a statement, then he takes it up and he works it out in detail, sums it up
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   at the end.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.140]   Now, here is the statement.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.880]   Verses 5 and 6 are the key to the understanding of the whole of the seventh chapter of this
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.280]   epistle to the Romans.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.520]   In this statement, therefore, we find certain things, and this is why it is so essential
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.100]   to examine it.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.220]   It is first of all essential to an understanding of the apostle's argument.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.360]   There are so many people who get lost in this seventh chapter and become bewildered.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.840]   Now, you will never follow the apostle's argument in detail unless you are clear in
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.000]   your minds as to the general position and statement which he is here laying down.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.560]   Secondly, this statement is absolutely essential to an understanding of the apostle's doctrine
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.600]   concerning the law.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.080]   And that is, of course, very vital in this epistle as it is in the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.200]   Here is really the central classical statement with regard to that matter.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.880]   And then thirdly, and obviously, this statement and the understanding of the statement is
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:43.200]   absolutely essential to the doctrine of salvation, and in this particular context, the doctrine
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   of sanctification.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.600]   He has already dealt with the law in the matter of justification.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.520]   Particularly here, he is concerned about the law in the matter of sanctification.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.760]   But of course, it is right to say, as I have just said, that he does deal with the whole
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.580]   doctrine of salvation itself.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.360]   And it is because people are not clear about this matter that they are confused from the
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.840]   very beginning to the end with respect to this whole matter.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.560]   Well, now then, the best way, it seems to me, to approach it is this.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.320]   We must look at the actual terms or expressions which the apostle uses.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.520]   And the first, of course, is this expression, "in the flesh."
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.960]   For these reasons, we can translate it like this, "because when we were in the flesh,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.120]   certain things were true of us."
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.440]   Now, what does he mean by saying that we were in the flesh?
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:03.200]   Here is the first use in this epistle of this term, "the flesh," which is, of course,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   a great term in the epistles of this apostle.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.320]   You find it from here on in this epistle, and you find it in the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.640]   And as you know very well, discussion has so often turned round the meaning of the term
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   "the flesh."
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.560]   There are different schools of theology which have come into being simply because of different
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.240]   interpretations of this expression, "in the flesh."
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.920]   And therefore it is one of those most important terms which we must be quite clear about.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.760]   And you will find that in the Scripture that this term is used in a number of different
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.380]   ways.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.400]   And that is, of course, why the confusion has tended to come in.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.040]   The apostles, even an apostle like this, when he came to handle this great truth, suffered
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.980]   from the limitation of language.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.160]   It is a constant difficulty in the exposition of Christian truth.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.960]   Our terminology, our language, is limited.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   And the same word is used in a number of different ways and has a different number of meanings.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.480]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.480]   Take this word "flesh."
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.040]   Sometimes the word "flesh" is used in the Scripture to mean the whole of mankind.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.480]   "All flesh shall see the salvation of God."
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.520]   Then again, "All flesh is as grass, and all the goodliness of men as the flower of
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   grass."
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.880]   Now, "flesh" there simply means the whole of mankind.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.960]   Therefore there is one possible meaning.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.640]   But then, at other times, the word "flesh" is used to mean the body.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.160]   For instance, in that great statement in Galatians 2.20, the apostle says, "I have
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.800]   been crucified with Christ, and nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.200]   And the life," he says, "I now live in the flesh.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.360]   I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and who gave himself for me."
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.080]   Well, now, obviously there he is using the word "flesh" to mean the body.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.280]   The life I now live in the body.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.400]   And he is referring solely to the body, the bodily part of our being.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.040]   So it may mean the body.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:36.020]   But then, in other places, the flesh obviously means the sensuous part of our nature.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.880]   You will find this in many places.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.520]   Take for instance in Galatians 5.16, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   Spirit lusteth against the flesh."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.400]   Now, he is not talking about the body there.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:57.560]   He is talking about something different, and that is this sensuous or sensual part of our
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.480]   being and our makeup.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.600]   Something that is there, you see, in a believer.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.120]   So we must remember that it has that third possible use.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.960]   Well, now then, the question that arises here is, is the word "flesh" in the flesh as
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.540]   it is used in our verse this evening?
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.400]   Is it to be explained in any one of those ways?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.360]   Well, I think it is obvious that it isn't.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.840]   He isn't referring to the whole of mankind.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.520]   He is referring here, in particular, to what is true of Christian people.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.840]   He is not making a general statement about the whole of mankind.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.440]   He is saying that something was true of Christians which is no longer true of them.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.960]   Again, obviously, he is not referring to the body, because when he wrote he was still in
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   the body.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.840]   But he says when we were in the flesh.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.200]   We are no longer in the flesh.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:54.160]   So again, it cannot mean the body, and we have to exclude that.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.880]   And in the same way, we have got to exclude, as I think we shall see more and more as we
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.800]   go on with this chapter, that third possible explanation, namely the sensuous part of our
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.360]   being and of our nature.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.320]   Well then, what is he referring to here?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.200]   What is the particular connotation of the term in this fifth verse of the seventh chapter
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.080]   of this epistle to the Romans?
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.800]   Well, here we have, I think we'll be able to see, what is, after all, the commonest
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.400]   use of all of this particular term.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.360]   And indeed, the very context explains what it does mean.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:39.440]   It means the opposite to life in the spirit.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.240]   We were in the flesh, but we are no longer in the flesh.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   Where are we now then?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.760]   Well, now we are in the spirit.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.840]   We were in the realm of the flesh.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.440]   We are now in the realm of the spirit.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.240]   Now, I read that section from chapter eight, because there the apostle, well, he does make
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.120]   it perfectly clear—listen to it again from verse four—that the righteousness of the
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.280]   law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.840]   Well, how then?
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   After the spirit.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.680]   Then, "they that are after the flesh to mind the things of the flesh, they that are
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   after the spirit, the things of the spirit."
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.560]   Then I go on to take it up again in verse eight.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:30.000]   So then he says, "they that are in the flesh cannot please God, but you are not in
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.440]   the flesh, but in the spirit."
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.320]   So I say the obvious meaning of "in the flesh" means that it's the opposite to
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.920]   being in the spirit.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.120]   You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   If so be that the spirit of God dwells in you.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.200]   Now, if any men have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.520]   Now, surely that establishes the meaning here quite clearly.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.760]   To be in the flesh means not to be in the spirit.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.400]   This is a most important term, therefore, a most important definition.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.880]   Perhaps the clearest statement of it all is to be found in our Lord's talk with Nicodemus
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.720]   in the third chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.520]   You'll find this in the sixth verse.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:28.280]   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit."
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   That's it.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.440]   That's what he's telling Nicodemus.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.680]   He says, "You must be born again."
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.000]   Nicodemus couldn't see why, and that's the answer.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh."
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.200]   "It's no use your asking questions," says our Lord to Nicodemus in effect.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.280]   "You are trying in your fleshly condition, in the flesh, with your natural mind, you're
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.240]   trying to understand what I'm talking about, but you can't do it."
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.160]   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, but this is born of the spirit, and this is
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   something spiritual."
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.720]   "So don't marvel that I said unto thee, 'You must be born again.'"
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:13.640]   If you like, therefore, we can say that to be in the flesh is to be unregenerate.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:22.660]   It is the natural state of man in sin, in which sin has dominion over him.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:31.560]   It means that the evil principle of sin is controlling the whole of his life.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.360]   It means that he has a corrupt nature.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.400]   He hasn't a new life, he hasn't a new nature.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.280]   It's the old nature, the old corrupt nature.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.520]   Man unregenerate in sin, under the dominion of sin, and polluted.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.200]   Now there is no doubt at all that an alternative term, if you're interested in it, is the term
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.260]   "carnal."
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.880]   As you know, there's a great deal of confusion about this term "carnal."
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.520]   It figures in people's doctrine of sanctification.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.520]   They say a man, first of all, is unregenerate, then he becomes converted, and at that stage
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   he's only carnal.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.280]   Then he gets a further experience and he becomes spiritual.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.840]   But surely the eighth chapter of this epistle makes it quite clear that that's a very wrong
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.040]   use of the term "carnal."
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.720]   Did you notice there in chapter eight how the apostle puts it?
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.800]   Let me read it again to you.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.040]   That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.720]   but after the spirit.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.520]   For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.120]   That's the thing they're interested in.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.240]   But they that are after the spirit mind the things of the spirit.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.960]   For, because, to be carnally minded.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.400]   That's obviously exactly the same as to be after the flesh.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.560]   And to mind the things that are after the flesh, to be carnally minded, is death.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.880]   But to be spiritually minded, there's the opposite.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.640]   Spiritual and carnal.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   Spiritual or flesh.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:09.760]   Carnal and carnally minded are identical and synonymous with being in the flesh.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:17.240]   Because he goes on to say, "The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.360]   to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.080]   Well, then that obviously cannot be a Christian.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.200]   And to be carnally minded means you're unregenerate.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.040]   So he goes on to say, "So then, they that are in the flesh," in other words, they that
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.000]   are carnal and are carnally minded, "cannot please God."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.360]   But you are not in the flesh.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.800]   You are not carnal.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   But in the spirit.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   "If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.440]   "Ah, yes," says somebody, "that's all right.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:54.040]   But what about 1 Corinthians 3, where the apostle starts by saying this, "And I, brethren,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:01.760]   could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   Christ."
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.840]   Then in verse 3, "For ye are yet carnal, for whereas there is among you envying and strife
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.960]   and divisions, are ye not carnal and walk as men?"
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.640]   What of that?
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.080]   Well, it seems to me there's only one thing to say about it.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.240]   What the apostle is clearly teaching is that as long as you are doing this sort of thing,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:33.080]   says the apostle, you are still behaving as if you were still carnal people.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.560]   The moment we are converted, we don't suddenly see everything clearly and perfectly.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.760]   We are no longer in the flesh.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.600]   We are already in the spirit.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.800]   But our understanding is defective.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.440]   And those Corinthians were still thinking in this particular matter as if they were
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.040]   still and regenerate.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.720]   He says, "Look here, you are behaving still in that old way."
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.400]   But the basic definition of carnal, obviously, is this one in the eighth chapter of this
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.320]   epistle to the Romans.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:10.520]   And we therefore must explain 1 Corinthians 3 in terms of this rather than the other way
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   around.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.640]   Here the apostle is using the terms interchangeably, and therefore this is obviously, I say, the
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.120]   basic definition.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.760]   And bearing that in mind, the other resolves itself quite simply.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.600]   He says, "You are babes, and you are babes because in this matter you are still thinking
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.200]   as you used to think."
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   Very well.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.640]   Well, now then, there is the main meaning, clearly, of "in the flesh" in our verse
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.760]   this evening.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.720]   But it surely has another meaning also.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:47.320]   Because you notice that the apostle not only contrasts being in the flesh and in the Spirit,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.960]   but also contrasts it with being under the law or not under the law.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.880]   Indeed, the answer to the definition of the flesh in verse 5 is given in verse 6.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.600]   But now we are delivered from the law.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.640]   We were, you see, under the law, but we have been delivered from it.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.320]   Well, when we were under the law, we were in the flesh.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.560]   So it carries the double meaning.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.320]   Being in the flesh means also to be under the law.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.800]   Now the apostle uses it in exactly the same way in Galatians 3.3.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:30.360]   Having begun in the Spirit, he says, "Are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.560]   You remember the trouble in the Galatians was that they had listened to those false
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.240]   Judaistic teachers who came round and said, "Yes, it's all right, you believe the gospel,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.320]   but that doesn't put you right as Christians.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.480]   You've got to be circumcised also.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.960]   You've got to carry out certain parts of the law."
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:52.080]   "No, no," says Paul, "having started in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   flesh?"
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:59.400]   And he means by "in the flesh" by going back to those old rules and regulations which
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.880]   were under the law.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:08.960]   Perfect then is the meaning of this term "flesh," that it carries the dual meaning
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:15.120]   of our being not in the Spirit and of our positively being under the law.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:22.000]   Now there is a very good statement of all this in Philippians 3.3, where again the apostle
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.320]   is dealing with this whole question of the Judaizers.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.280]   He says, "We are the circumcision."
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.480]   Don't listen to these people who are trying to circumcise you.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   He says, "We are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, who rejoice in Christ Jesus,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.520]   and have no confidence in the flesh."
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.320]   What does he mean by "in the flesh" there?
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.680]   Well, I think he means exactly the two things which have come out in this fifth verse of
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.920]   this seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.600]   He says, "We have none of the self-confidence that we had when we were in the flesh"—confidence
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:07.640]   in birth, confidence in race, confidence in tribe, and also confidence in good religious
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.120]   works under the law, as regards the dictates of the law, perfect.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:20.400]   All that means having confidence in the flesh, confidence in the ability that I can, by keeping
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.160]   the law, justify myself before God.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   Very well then.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:33.120]   Here the apostle, I say, is anxious to emphasize both meanings of this term "in the flesh."
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:43.360]   When we were in the flesh, we were not in the Spirit, and we were under the law.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:49.480]   Now it is important for us to notice that he says that that is universally true of the
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.840]   whole of mankind, which is unregenerate.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.200]   It doesn't matter how good people may be, it doesn't matter how moral they may be,
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.640]   it doesn't matter how religious they may be.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.760]   If they are not in the Spirit, they are in the flesh.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:16.280]   And at the same time, as we saw in verse 4, they are under the law.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:23.000]   So that I can put it like this, that there are only two possible positions.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.800]   Everybody in this world at this moment is in one of these two conditions.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:35.560]   They are either in the flesh and under the law, or else they are in the Spirit and are
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   under grace.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.320]   Now, he has already said that in verse 14.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.720]   He says, after the sixth chapter, "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.640]   are not under the law, but under grace."
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.200]   Now these terms must be taken together.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.840]   And it is very important that we should understand this.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:03.040]   You see, if we identify flesh in this verse as meaning the body and the sins of the body
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:11.440]   only, we are going to confuse the whole issue, because there are certain people who are not
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.720]   guilty of these flagrant sins of the body.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.800]   And therefore they would say of them, "Ah, they are not in the flesh."
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.720]   But they are in the flesh.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:26.520]   The best moral man in the world tonight, who is not a Christian, is in the flesh.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.680]   Now if you want a verse that really puts this distinction quite perfectly, you will find
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:38.160]   it in the epistle to the Ephesians, in the second chapter, and in the third verse, where
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:45.440]   the apostle uses the word "flesh" in the two different senses, among whom also we
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:54.320]   all had our conversation in times past, "in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.520]   of the flesh and of the mind."
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.320]   Now then, you see, that last use of "flesh," where he talks about fulfilling the desires
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:11.040]   of the flesh and of the mind, there the "flesh" means the sensuous part of our nature.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.640]   But when he uses the "flesh" in the first instance, in talking about the lusts of our
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.080]   flesh, he is talking about everybody.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.360]   The lusts of the flesh can be subdivided into the lusts of the sensuous part of the nature
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.760]   and the lusts of the mind.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.240]   There I think is a very good way of seeing the difference between those two particular
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.240]   meanings of the term.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.560]   Well now then, let's leave it by putting it like this.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:47.360]   We were, says the apostle, in the flesh.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.480]   We were unregenerate.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.880]   We were dominated by an evil principle of sin.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.680]   We were under the dominion of sin.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.520]   And at the same time, we were under the dominion of the law.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:09.120]   For the strength of sin, as he tells the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 15, verse 56, the strength
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.480]   of sin is the law.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.240]   Now then, here is the thing to glory in.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.040]   You notice what he says?
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.920]   We were in the flesh.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.480]   Thank God we are no longer there if we are Christians.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.680]   We are no longer in the flesh if we are Christians.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.340]   We are in the Spirit.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.000]   We are under grace.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.800]   We have been translated into an entirely new realm.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.360]   Well there is our first term.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.280]   Let me hurry to the second term, the motions of sins.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.200]   Here is an interesting term.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   What does he mean?
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.280]   Passions, affections, sinful affections and lustings.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.560]   Now you notice what he says.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:04.480]   When we were in the flesh, these passions, lustings, affections of sins which were within
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.440]   us.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.280]   Now these are in all of us by nature, every one of us.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:18.440]   There has never been a human being since the fall, but that these motions, passions of
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.480]   sins were in them.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.800]   That is the result of the fall of man.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.060]   Now here once more I have to remind you of a very important distinction.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:37.400]   When he talks about the passions or the motions of sins, he does not mean the natural appetites
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.560]   in and of themselves.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.100]   So many Christians have gone astray over that.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:50.160]   You will remember how the Apostle Paul, in writing to Timothy, for instance, in the first
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   epistle in chapter 4, puts it like this.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.520]   Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.640]   faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:13.360]   having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:19.080]   to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.760]   believe and know the truth.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.360]   Here were people who claimed to be ultra-spiritual, and they said they were so spiritual that
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.120]   they could never dream of getting married.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.120]   Why?
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.160]   Well, sex is sinful.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:38.040]   It is a bodily appetite, and they did not eat meat for the same reason.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:45.000]   But you see the Apostle condemns that, and it should be condemned utterly and absolutely.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.680]   All the natural appetites have been created by God, given to us by God.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.240]   That is his teaching, as it is the teaching of the Bible everywhere.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.480]   And for us to regard the natural appetites as sinful in and of themselves is grievous
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   error.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.000]   And this is a truth which needs to be tremendously emphasized.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.200]   Take for instance the Roman Catholic Church, with their so-called celibate priesthood.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.480]   Their priests do not get married.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   Why?
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.520]   Well, it is because they have gone wrong at this point, you see.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:28.600]   That is a false asceticism which regards the body and its appetites as inherently sinful.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.640]   It is just a denial of the scriptural teaching, and it is a very serious misunderstanding.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:42.040]   No, no, there is nothing wrong with the natural appetites in and of themselves.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:48.240]   God put them in men for the purposes of procreation, for the filling of the world with people,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.720]   and all hunger instinct, protective instinct, and all these, they are there given by God
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.960]   for the well-being of men and for the replenishing of the earth.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.720]   Very well, then what does he mean by the passions of sins?
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.400]   Oh, he means the natural appetites which are good in and of themselves, but as they have
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:15.080]   become as the result of the fall and of sin.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   You see, as God made men, he made them with these natural appetites, yes, but before men
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.880]   fell, he kept them in their place.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.840]   There was a balance in men's life.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.400]   The moment men sinned, the balance was upset.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.720]   And instead of men controlling his appetites, the appetites began to control him.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.160]   That's what he means.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.760]   The thing we are seeing so much in the world today.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.260]   The natural appetites, I say, are a part of men, yes, but you know, they were never meant
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.320]   to be front-page news in the newspapers, were they?
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.800]   Sex is created by God, but not in the way you see it in your newspapers.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.600]   That's the thing.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.680]   It's become controlling, dominant, it's the big thing.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.640]   Men live to eat today, they live to indulge their sex.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.080]   That's where it's gone wrong.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.880]   The thing itself is all right, as long as it's kept in its place, governed by the intellect,
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.000]   the understanding, by a sense of righteousness, and by a relationship to God.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.480]   All to the glory of God.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.560]   But when man reverses it all, and is dominated by these drives, these passions, these lusts,
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.440]   well there he is in a sinful state.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.680]   There he is in the flesh.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.600]   Now then, that is the apostle's teaching.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.360]   A term that is used to express the same thing in the Scripture sometimes is "inordinate
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   affections."
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:54.040]   Affections are all right, but they must never become inordinate.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.720]   The moment they become inordinate, they are sinful.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.520]   If you like, here's a good translation of the passions of sins.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.920]   The feelings that prompt us to the commission of sins.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.800]   That's what they mean.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.520]   These passions or affections of sins, any feeling that you have that is driving you
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.600]   and prompting you and urging you to commit an act of sin.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.060]   Very well.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.240]   Now here is the extraordinary statement, the next term.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:31.680]   The motions, the passions of sin, which were by the law.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.000]   This is the most remarkable statement in many ways that this apostle ever made.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.640]   It isn't the most glorious, I say it's the most remarkable.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.760]   Coming especially from one who'd been a Pharisee of the Pharisees, and such an expert
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760]   on the law.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:51.960]   He says that the motions of sins which were by the law, be clear about that word "by."
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   It really means through, through the law.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.920]   What is he saying?
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:04.680]   Does he say here that it is the law that has given being to the passions of sins?
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.100]   No.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.840]   He is not talking about their origin.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.520]   He's not talking about their existence.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:23.320]   What he is saying is this, that the law stirs them up, arouses them, in a sense inflames
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.200]   them.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.240]   That is his statement.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.440]   These motions of sins that are in us, now as the result of the law or through the law,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.400]   they begin to do something.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   What do they do?
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.900]   Well, let's look at it again.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.880]   For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins which were by the law did work in
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.360]   our members.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.880]   Let's look at this word "work."
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.400]   It's a very interesting word.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.040]   It carries in it the notion of working powerfully.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.200]   Not just working, but working powerfully.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:05.960]   Again, you'll find the same word used in the epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 2,
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   where I've been quoting.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.440]   Listen to the apostle.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:15.560]   He says, "Ye were the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins," in which he
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.440]   says, "we all had our conversation in times past.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:28.080]   We walked," he says, "according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.560]   that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.760]   It's exactly the same word.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.040]   "That's how we lived," he says.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.680]   We walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.560]   of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.520]   These evil spirits which are surrounding us, which we don't see, but which are controlling
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.240]   us and controlling so much of life, it works.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.360]   This spirit of iniquity is working.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:04.600]   Well, he says that the notions of sins work in exactly the same way in this unregenerate
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   person.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.080]   Or let me give you another illustration of this word.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.520]   Take that great statement in Philippians 2, 12 and 13.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:21.880]   "Work out," he says, "your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.600]   worketh in you."
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.800]   That's the word.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.000]   It is God that worketh in you, both the will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.160]   And when God works, he works powerfully.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.720]   God can't work in any other way.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.160]   It is God that worketh—you know, when he says, "Work out your own salvation," it
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   isn't the same word.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.680]   It's a much weaker word.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.520]   Work it out.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.760]   But God worketh, and he uses this powerful word.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.840]   It carries that meaning, and the other meaning it carries is that it does so inwardly.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:59.000]   And here you see is this description of men in sin, unregenerate men, with these passions
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.200]   and affections and lusts of sin working inwardly, powerfully within him.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   How true it is.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.200]   Where do they work?
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   Well, he says, "They worked in our members."
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:16.320]   I needn't keep you with this.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.840]   We defined it several times in working our way through chapter 6.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.320]   You remember how we saw it there in verses 12 and 13.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:31.480]   "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, neither yield ye your members as instruments."
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:39.400]   And we defined it as meaning all our faculties, not the body only, but the whole of our faculties,
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:47.600]   mind, imagination, interest, everything through which a man expresses himself and his personality.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.920]   That's what's meant by members.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.440]   So what he means is this, you see.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.920]   These sinful, lustful feelings were working within us and working on our expression, our
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:09.200]   forms of expression, in order to bring forth fruit unto death.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.560]   Let us remember that it is not confined to outward actions.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.000]   Would to God that it were.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.440]   But the members, as I've said, include the mind and the imagination as well as the body.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:31.280]   So they may work in the mind and in the imagination, a man may sin in thought and sin in imagination
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.160]   quite as much as in the body.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.840]   Our Lord has settled that, hasn't he, forever in Matthew 5.28, "Whosoever looketh on a
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.880]   woman to lust hath already committed adultery with her in his mind and in his heart."
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:53.600]   Well, here it is, working in our members, these passions, these affections, these lusts,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   these drives of sin.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.840]   There we were, he says, they were working, getting our members to act.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:07.120]   We sinned in mind, in imagination, in heart, in body.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.920]   And what was the result of all this?
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.360]   He says it was fruit unto death.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.240]   You notice the contrast?
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.520]   At the end of verse 4 he says that we are married to Christ, that we should bring forth
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.400]   fruit unto God.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:30.800]   But before, we spent our time in bringing forth fruit unto death.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.000]   Death is personified for the moment, in order to emphasize the thing.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.660]   And of course it is the simple truth that all sinful actions lead always and only unto
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.660]   death.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:48.120]   That's the terrible thing about the life of sin.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.360]   It's a life of death.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.800]   That's why Philip Duttridge put it in the hymn we've just been singing, "Who,"
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:03.960]   he said, "would grudge to part with ashes."
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.240]   The life of the men of the world, tonight, the sinful life leads to ashes.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.320]   He burns himself out.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:17.720]   There's nothing left at the end but the ashes, the remnants, the ruins of a life.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.960]   Death.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.480]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it quite clearly.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.720]   He's contrasting the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer, and this
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.400]   is what he says in chapter 9, in verse 14.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.600]   How much more, he says, shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.960]   himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from what?
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:54.200]   From dead works, dead works, to serve the living God.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.360]   All the actions of sin are dead, and they lead to nothing but death.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.760]   Oh, I mustn't stay with this, but if there's anybody in this congregation who isn't regenerate
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:09.080]   and doesn't know that he or she is in the Spirit, let me tell you that all you're
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.280]   doing is just leading to death.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:18.120]   It leads to moral death, death of the moral sensibilities.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.440]   You'll get coarser and coarser and duller and duller, and all that is fine in you will
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.880]   become gradually extinguished, and you'll be left as an exhausted hulk or as a heap
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   of ashes.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.560]   Moral death.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.720]   Yes, and spiritual death.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:42.760]   All these activities mean the death of the Spirit.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:48.600]   When men rebelled and sinned against God, he died a spiritual death.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.800]   He was equipped to wear dead in trespasses and sins, quiet, spiritually dead.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.160]   And all the works of a dead man are dead works, spiritually dead.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.480]   Yes, but it also leads to physical death.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.880]   I'm simply recapitulating what I said on chapter 6, verse 23, that the wages of sin
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.880]   is death.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.520]   Physical death is included.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.560]   Man would never have died if he hadn't sinned.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.740]   He wasn't meant for death.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:26.040]   It was sin that produced his physical death.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:34.200]   And finally, and on top of all, and most serious of all, the second death.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.840]   The second death.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.560]   For all who are not in the Spirit, who are out of Christ, will not only die physically,
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:52.080]   they will be consigned to a second death, which will go on to all eternity.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.960]   Those who are in Christ, those who are in the Spirit, will never experience the second
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   death.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:05.640]   That is, final, eternal separation from God and his glorious life.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.880]   Well, now then, there are our terms.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.240]   Shall I sum up the doctrine as we close?
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.600]   Here it is.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.720]   What does this verse teach us?
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:21.960]   Well, the first thing it teaches us is the true and the terrible nature of sin.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.560]   What a terrible thing sin is.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.740]   What a terrible power sin is.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:36.640]   You see, the modern popular psychological view is that sin is only something negative,
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.680]   that it's only the absence of good qualities.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.160]   The popular psychologists don't like the term sin, they don't believe it.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.840]   They say sin isn't positive.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.080]   A man isn't positively sinful, it's just the absence of certain good qualities.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:57.520]   No, no, says Paul, the motions of sin, the passions of sin.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.040]   And there are other psychologists, you see, who are wise enough to see that.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.400]   They talk about these drives that are within us.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.200]   And you know, the natural man is absolutely helpless in their grip.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.120]   He's completely helpless.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.880]   They are controlling him, they are mastering him, they are driving him.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.600]   And did you notice that it's as powerful as this?
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:25.320]   That it has the ability even to frustrate, as it were, the law of God.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:31.160]   The power of sin in the unregenerate man is so strong that the law of God can't deliver
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   him.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.600]   It does the opposite, says Paul.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.880]   It produces, it aggravates the passions and the motions and the lusts.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.640]   It makes them work in the members more than before.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.600]   Now he's going to work that out in great detail from verse 7 onwards, but he's stating
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.000]   it all in principle here.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.480]   There is nothing more fatal than not to realize the terrible power of sin.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:04.360]   Sin is the next greatest power to God himself.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.480]   The passions of sin.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   It's so powerful, I say, that though God gives a holy law, it can't deliver us.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.480]   There's the first thing.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.680]   The second, therefore, is this.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.920]   It shows us, doesn't it, this verse, the limited scope and value of the teaching of
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   morality.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:31.120]   There's a great deal of moral teaching today, and it looks to me as if we are going to have
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.260]   more and more.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.840]   It seems to me that the present Home Secretary is entirely guided by this idea.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.160]   It's his advisors who are putting it to him.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.160]   I have no doubt about that at all.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.400]   But you see, they're going to reform the prisons still more.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.760]   They're going to treat the prisoners psychologically.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.600]   And it's all based on a failure to realize the truth about sin.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:58.200]   It's all really a failure to understand Romans 7.5.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.000]   They rarely believe that you can solve the problem of crime and juvenile delinquency
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.500]   and all these sins that are multiplying so rapidly by just doing away with punishment,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.220]   speaking nicely, persuading people, encouraging them.
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:18.180]   The astounding thing is, of course, that they're still saying things like that in spite of
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.940]   what we know to be true of society today.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:26.780]   They have long since abolished punishment in the schools, of course, and we are seeing
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.180]   the consequences.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.300]   Punishment has been abolished from the family, and we are seeing the consequences there.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.620]   We are witnessing an increasing lawlessness.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.620]   But they won't believe it.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.620]   They're going to do more of it.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:43.540]   They're going to multiply these educational aspects of the prisons and so on.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.940]   And you're going to be nice and kind, and these people will respond.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.380]   They can't respond.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.100]   They're incapable of response.
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.100]   Why?
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.260]   The motions of sins.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.260]   The motions of sins are too powerful.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.940]   It can't be done.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.700]   Why the most tender appeals of a father or a mother or a wife or children are not enough.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:09.620]   The power of sin is beyond them all, and yet they're relying on this kind of thing.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:16.620]   Morality teaching is, speaking generally, a sheer waste of time.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:22.060]   The best it can ever do is to frighten certain timorous people against certain particular
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   sins.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.060]   It'll do nothing more.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   It won't change the heart.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.060]   It won't change the desire.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.420]   It won't change the man.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.500]   But you see, it's even worse than that.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:38.980]   According to the apostles' teaching here, it may be a positive danger, an actual danger.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:39.980]   Why?
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.580]   Well, because it inflames the passions.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.740]   It encourages them.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.980]   It stimulates them.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.180]   To the pure, all things are pure.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:57.540]   But to them that are disobedient and unbelieving is nothing pure, nothing at all.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.540]   Everything becomes defiled.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:05.700]   I've known many a man—I knew quite a number when I was a student—who said they were
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.900]   reading certain books because they thought they'd help them and strengthen them in
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.500]   the fight, the moral fight.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.540]   And they were honest enough, many of them, to admit and to confess that they'd done
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.620]   them great harm.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:27.500]   A minister of religion once told me that the book that had done him the greatest harm in
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.860]   his own personal life was a book called The Mastery of Sex.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.860]   Avoid them, my friends.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.020]   They'll do you more harm than good.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:42.820]   Because of this, you see, the motions of sins are inflamed by the law, the very law that
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:49.460]   prohibits them encourages us to do them, because we are impure to start with.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:54.620]   So a morality teaching can even be a positive danger.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.020]   By teaching these children about sex and by warning them against the consequences of certain
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.980]   actions what you're really doing is to introduce them to the whole subject.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.460]   And of course they greatly enjoy it.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.460]   Their curiosity is aroused and they'll want to read further books.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.820]   You're probably doing them grievous harm.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.780]   Now that's a strong statement, isn't it?
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:19.580]   But I am here to assert that the Victorian attitude towards sex in practice was more
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:23.020]   successful than the present day.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.020]   More successful.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.820]   I am not here to defend Victorianism, but I am here to expand the scripture.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.380]   And the scripture says the thing is too dangerous.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.460]   If they were pure, if they were innocent, all right, then you could do it.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.460]   But they're not.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.460]   They're impure.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.460]   These motions of sins are there, and the more you tell them, the more you'll arouse an
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.820]   interest and a desire.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.840]   Be careful, my friends.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:52.260]   The way to overcome sin is not to teach morality, it is to preach the gospel.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.700]   Very well, there is the second thing we are told here.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:47:00.300]   But let me come to the third, which is this, that we are told about the real function and
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.820]   purpose of the law, and in particular the law of Moses.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.300]   It was never meant to save.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.500]   Never meant to save.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.940]   God never gave the law to the children of Israel in order that they might save themselves
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.940]   by it.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.980]   It was their crass misinterpretation of it that ever led them to think that.
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:24.620]   It couldn't, because what it does is to aggravate the passions of sins.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.420]   Well, why was it ever given?
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.380]   It was given, as we have seen at the end of chapter five, the law entered that the offense
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.900]   might abound.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:39.540]   It was given to define sin, to bring it out in its real nature, and to show the need of
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.500]   a savior.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:47.780]   The Jews and the Pharisees in particular had gone completely wrong about that.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:53.940]   The law was never intended by God as a way of salvation.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.860]   It was simply to show the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.460]   So that brings me to my last word.
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:11.160]   This verse, in a most amazing manner, and perhaps from the negative side, more powerfully
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:21.620]   than any verse you'll find in the whole of Scripture, shows the utter, absolute necessity
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.740]   of the Lord Jesus Christ and his work.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:31.060]   Don't you see it?
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:39.420]   Having shown us the depth of sin and the complete inability of the Lord to deliver from it,
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.380]   indeed, the fact that the law even aggravates it, even giving of the law, God can't save
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.020]   man.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.140]   What then can save him?
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.220]   And there is only one answer.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:03.580]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ and his perfect work on our behalf.
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:09.860]   It is because the whole of mankind was in the flesh, and because it was in the flesh
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:17.300]   the motions of sin which were by the Lord did work powerfully within us and in our members
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:24.860]   to bring forth fruit unto death, that the Son of God left the courts of heaven and was
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:30.620]   born as a babe in Bethlehem and gave perfect obedience to the law and took our sins in
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:35.940]   his own body on the tree, was dead and buried and rose again.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:42.980]   It was because of this he came, he had to come.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.340]   There was no other way.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.500]   This verse proves it.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:53.540]   The condition of man was such that nothing and no one else could save.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:50:01.140]   "Thou must save, and thou alone."
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.660]   And thank God he does.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:14.340]   He delivers us from the flesh and puts us into the Spirit, and the Spirit into us, and
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:23.740]   thereby we are joined to him and the power of his light, which is more powerful even
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:28.580]   than the motions, the passions of sin.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:36.140]   Thank God for so great a salvation which gives us so great a deliverance.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.140]   Amen.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:48.060]   O Lord, our God, we turn unto thee in humble praise and thanksgiving as we realize this
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.060]   glorious truth.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:59.260]   O God, it grieves us to think of what sin and the fall have made of the whole of the
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.940]   human race.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:10.700]   We realize that we were all once there, but we thank thee, O God, that we can say that
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:20.260]   we were there, but we are no longer there by thy blessed, wondrous grace.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:30.460]   O Lord, receive our humble and unworthy praise and enable us to see this truth so clearly
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:36.220]   that we shall become lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:44.220]   O open our eyes to it, that we may see what in thy love and mercy thou hast done for us
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:51.380]   through Jesus Christ, thy blessed Son, and our Lord and Savior.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:58.300]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:05.180]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:13.500]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.580]   Amen.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.500]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
