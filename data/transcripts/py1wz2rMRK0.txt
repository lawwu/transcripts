[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Here's today's question.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.600]   Dear Pastor John, I am a female student at a secular university.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.880]   I am normally pretty joyful in my relationship with God and in day-to-day living.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.520]   However, the wickedness of my surroundings continues to grieve me.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.120]   Today in the lecture, I could barely keep from crying as we discussed a novel so full
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   of depravity I decided to just read the spark notes of the book instead of read the book
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.480]   itself.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.560]   But even the summary is hard to read.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.760]   My heart is so weighed down and broken.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.480]   I feel that I am the only one who even senses the evil around me.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   And I mourn that I am in a setting that is forcing me into a knowledge that seems premature.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.180]   I don't understand their pragmatic justifications.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.240]   Every poem, short story, and novel we have covered is filled with sex, rape, grotesque,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.560]   and graphic depictions of murder, infant side, slavery, and cursing.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.480]   It makes me so weary.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.880]   And they call those things morally ambiguous.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.920]   What can I do?
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   What should I do?
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.040]   Pastor John, what would you say to this female college student?
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.440]   Wow, there's so many different angles that we could come at this.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.260]   I mean, I could camp on that word morally ambiguous and say, "Are you kidding me?
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.480]   Just have one of their children raped and see if they call it morally ambiguous."
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.700]   That's a lot of baloney.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.600]   But I'm not going to come at it that way.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.000]   This may be a good occasion to give a few thoughts about my understanding of the way
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.720]   Christians should seek to be educated.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   That's the direction I'm going to go.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.040]   And just apologize ahead of time if that's not what she needs most.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.840]   But it just felt like I should do this.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.480]   So when I say, "How should a Christian be educated?"
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.920]   I mean, how should our character be formed from the time we're little to the time we're
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   80?
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.400]   How should our character be formed?
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.160]   How should our worldview be shaped?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   Who should shape it?
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   How should it be shaped?
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.940]   The way we view everything?
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.880]   And third, how should our skill, how should we be equipped with the necessary skills for
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   the particular calling that we have?
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.700]   Those three things are what I mean by education.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.160]   So we start with the conviction.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.860]   I start with the conviction that human beings don't come into the world like birds and squirrels
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.840]   with incredible instincts built into their DNA that enable them to fly and hunt and jump.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.120]   I watch the squirrel outside my window jump from limb to limb.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   I say, "That's just absolutely incredible that he can do that and know exactly where
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   to land, even though the limb that he's jumping from is going to give way under his feet and
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.480]   he has to know how hard to push off."
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.520]   Calculating the give way and the...
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.000]   You can see I'm just amazed every day.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.680]   So human beings come into the world with virtually zero education, except maybe the sucking reflex,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   right?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.240]   Amazing, absolutely amazing.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.600]   But we poor human beings have to learn almost everything through what others show us or
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.220]   by trial and error.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.160]   So almost everything we need to know we get by learning, by education.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.920]   It's educated into us by someone or some experience that we have.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.240]   The Bible charges parents first and foremost with this job of educating little bitty human
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.880]   beings who don't know anything and would perish if you left them alone.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.120]   And these words, this is Deuteronomy 6, "These words that I command you today shall be on
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.440]   your heart and you shall teach them diligently to your children."
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.600]   That's one of the most important instructions in the Bible.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Or Ephesians 6, "Fathers, bring up your children in the discipline and the instruction of the
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Lord."
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.760]   Don't leave them to find things out by themselves.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.920]   This is just lunatic to treat children as though they shouldn't be instructed in the
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   way of the Lord.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.920]   Then, besides parents, the Bible says that there are sages or wise men, wise women from
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.360]   whom we can gain much wisdom and knowledge.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.720]   It's another dimension of education.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, Proverbs 13.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.960]   The lips of the wise spread knowledge, Proverbs 15, 7.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.240]   And then the New Testament says that God has ordained that there be teachers in the church
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.160]   and they help us grow in knowledge and understanding.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.360]   Hebrews 5, "By this time you ought to be teachers."
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.160]   Or 1 Corinthians 12, "God has appointed in the church teachers."
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.440]   So from the time we are children, we're to keep on learning, keep on growing in the knowledge
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.560]   and understanding of the Lord, 2 Peter 3.18.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.480]   And education, therefore, is not just a phase of life like, "Oh, I have to go to school
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   for 12 years or 16 years or whatever."
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.920]   It's part of life to the very end.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:15.160]   Now, till now, all I've said is that the Bible points towards the shaping of our character
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.320]   and the learning of our worldview and the gaining of our skills from fellow believers,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.120]   parents and wise people and teachers.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   And that is the main point.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.440]   Unbelievers will not be able to teach us the most important things we need to know about
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.400]   God and about His ways in the world.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.920]   Nevertheless, that's not all that the Bible has to say about education.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.760]   It tells us that we should have our eyes open and become serious observers of the world.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.520]   Go to the ant, consider her ways and be wise, Proverbs 6.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.840]   Consider the lilies, consider the birds, Matthew 6.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.600]   Study the weather, Matthew 16.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.680]   Learn to read, Ephesians 4.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.000]   Use your reason.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.760]   Come now, let us reason together, Isaiah 1.18.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.920]   Be children in your thinking, in your thinking be mature, 1 Corinthians 14.20.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.120]   So in general, we could say that there are two kinds of knowledge Christians gain in
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.440]   school and in lifelong education.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:27.200]   One is knowledge of God and His ways and His world that is distinctively Christian.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.360]   And the other is knowledge that overlaps with what unbelievers know.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.160]   Two plus two is four.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.160]   Grammatical rules, chemical processes, laws of physics, human anatomy, a thousand aspects
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.800]   of common experience of the world that we share, we overlap with unbelievers.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   And to the degree that a body of knowledge can be known by an unbelieverâ€”now here I'm
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.280]   starting to get to her situation a little bit.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.440]   You wonder, where is he going with this?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.040]   To the degree that a body of knowledge can be known by an unbeliever, to that degree
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.920]   can we be educated by an unbeliever?
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.360]   Keeping in mind, of course, that this body of knowledge will only be fully understood
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.820]   in its relation to God's, His hand in creation, His hand in providence, His hand in leading
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.720]   it to its ultimate purposes.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.480]   But there's an overlap between knowledge that unbelievers have and knowledge that we
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:36.920]   need so that we can be educated in some dimension to the degree that that knowledge is shared.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.720]   Now here's the flip side of that point.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.000]   To the degree that a body of knowledgeâ€”it sounds like she's in a class of literature
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.760]   maybe, say modern American literature or modern English literatureâ€”to the degree that a
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:59.120]   body of knowledge is misunderstood and wrongly evaluated by an unbeliever, to that degree
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.480]   should we avoid being educated by an unbeliever?
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.720]   In other words, it's a matter of degree here.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.680]   To the degree that they're giving bad information and bad evaluation, they're going to be less
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.880]   useful for the believer, or really for anybody for that matter.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:25.320]   So what this means in the university generally is that in the hard sciences, the overlap
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.880]   of knowledge between believer and unbeliever is greater.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:37.560]   And in the humanities and social sciences, the overlap is smaller and becomes increasingly
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   problematical.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:46.120]   In other words, these disciplines reveal almost immediately that value judgments form the
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.280]   warp and woof of the subject matter.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.080]   Value judgments about what is beautiful and ugly in this literature, what's right and
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.400]   wrong, good and bad, helpful and harmful, just and unjust, loving and unloving.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.680]   And to the degree that a teacher sees the subject matter in a way that is contrary to
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.760]   the Scriptures and contrary to a biblical worldview, to that degree it will be difficult
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:22.360]   to get the kind of education in that class that the Lord wants us to get.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:29.720]   So all of that to say to our friend who is so distressed in her university class that
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:38.240]   glory is in shame, try to discern ahead of time which teachers and which classes will
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   distort the body of knowledge that you want to get and distort the value judgments that
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.280]   you want to form and avoid those classes and teachers by and large.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.640]   This might mean changing schools.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.120]   It might simply mean being more selective in the courses and teachers you choose.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:09.920]   I'll close by saying I personally am jealous for young people, especially Christian young
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:20.160]   people, I am jealous for young people to be exposed to great Christian thinking.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:28.000]   Most students in secular schools don't even get exposed to great Christian thinking, and
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.800]   to me that's a tragedy.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.000]   So I would encourage college-bound young people to make that a priority.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.520]   Find a school where you can be exposed to the greatest, the greatest Christian thinking
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.600]   about the subjects you love.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the really helpful question.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.000]   Keep those coming in to us.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.680]   To ask Pastor John a question of your own or for more details on this podcast, go to

[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:10.280]   Well, Friday we return with a question from Hebrews 1-4 where it says that Jesus became
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.480]   superior to angels.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.800]   Wait, what?
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.400]   Hasn't Jesus always been superior to angels?
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.920]   What does the author of Hebrews mean?
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.880]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.800]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   [END]
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:31.200]   1. Does Jesus always become superior to angels? (Hebrews 1-4)
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.520]   2. Is Jesus always superior to angels? (Hebrews 1-5)
