[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Reddit's S1 is kind of fun.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   Let's break it down, everybody.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.120]   2023 revenue, $804 million up 21% year over year.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.120]   They're still losing money.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.320]   Net loss $91 million in 2023.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.660]   Pre-cash flow is negative.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.100]   They're kind of bouncing along the breakeven mark,
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.660]   as you can see there on the chart there.
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.160]   Daily active unique $76 million up 27% year over year.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.200]   Average revenue per user is incredibly low, $3.42.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000]   This was a business that the last couple of years had flatlined
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.720]   because it was only growing 5% a year in terms of usage.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.300]   And then all of a sudden in the last two quarters,
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.760]   the usage started to climb pretty significantly.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.120]   Absent that growth story, it's a really challenged business
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.860]   because a business without much growth
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.300]   gets value typically on a multiple of the cash flow
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.500]   that they're generating, and there's less upside.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.460]   For you to make an investment at a $5 billion valuation here,
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.560]   you've really got to believe that the growth continues
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.660]   at this rate, and it doesn't revert back
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.920]   to the mean growth rate of the last couple of years
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.520]   of basically 5%, which is roughly flatlined.
