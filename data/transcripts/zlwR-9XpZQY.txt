[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   [Music]
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.480]   Oh my, so many great memories come back when I listen to old T4G albums like
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.000]   this one. As many of you know, Together for the Gospel 2018 begins today,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.120]   Wednesday, and it's gonna run until Friday, April 11th through the 13th, and
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.920]   the conference is sold out, and I think that means over 12,500 people have
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.260]   registered. This is incredible, and Pastor John, you're about to get on a jet here
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.880]   in Minneapolis to get to Louisville where you're scheduled to once again
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.600]   cap off the conference with the plenary session Friday afternoon. A message I
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.760]   really look forward to hearing. Here's just the title, "New God, New Gospel, New
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.600]   Gladness. How is Christian joy distinct?" And I got a little preview in a recent
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.200]   meeting and Psalm 4:7 just came alive. I'll never view that text in the same
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.040]   way, Pastor John. So looking forward to that message, but more on that later.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.160]   Before you leave for Louisville or Louval, Louisville or Louval, however you
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.400]   say it, here's our next question. How do we know if we're given to too little
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.880]   introspection or to too much introspection? How do we find the right
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.920]   balance between self-examination neglected and over self-examination made
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.600]   toxic? It's another really good question from a listener to this podcast. His name
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.360]   is Nolan. "Dear Pastor John, I earnestly desire to take the Bible seriously when
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   it talks about evaluating yourself, but I often find myself encountering
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.680]   unhealthy introspection into the sin in my life and my failure to overcome it. It
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.560]   on many days has led to despondency and discouragement, making it a challenge to
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.440]   believe the truth I try to preach to myself. What are some strategies you
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200]   evaluate yourself with while at the same time not going overboard to the point of
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.520]   paralysis and discouragement?" What would you say to Nolan? Such a good
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.920]   question, so relevant for so many people. I suppose I've wrestled not only myself
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.600]   but with people after services in prayer about this kind of doubting of ourselves
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.760]   because of introspective failure as any other thing I've had to deal
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.440]   with. So the first thing I want to say to Nolan is don't give up in your fight for
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.360]   faith and in your fight against sin and against paralyzing introspection. I have
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.840]   known people who, because of these kinds of inner conflicts, simply throw in the
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.120]   towel on Christianity and walk away from Christ and give themselves to whatever
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.440]   kind of heart-numbing habits they can find. And I'm pleading with you, Nolan, and
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.000]   others like you, that you not do this. That you be willing to struggle with
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.840]   this, if necessary, all the way to the grave. Don't throw in the towel on
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.360]   Christian faith. Not only do you not know what wonderful and surprising
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.560]   breakthroughs the Lord may have for you ten years from now, after a long struggle,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   but you will find on the other side of the grave how short life was and how
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.440]   wonderfully worth it it was to hold fast to Jesus in all the struggle while
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.560]   he was holding fast to you. But you asked for strategies for avoiding paralyzing
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.920]   introspection, so here are two or three passages from the Scripture and a couple
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.480]   of thoughts. 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 3 and 5, 3 through 5. "With me it
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.320]   is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:15.640]   not even judge myself, for I am not aware of anything against myself." In other
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.560]   words, generally I have a clear conscience. "But I'm not thereby acquitted. It is the
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.360]   Lord who judges me. Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.080]   before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   commendation from God." When Paul said, "I do not even judge myself," he didn't mean
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.960]   he never examines himself, because he says in 2 Corinthians 13 5, "Examine
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.440]   yourself to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.400]   this about yourselves that Christ Jesus is in you, unless indeed you fail to meet
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.040]   the test?" Paul wants us to have enough self-knowledge so that we can enjoy the
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.000]   assurance of our salvation through faith in Jesus. So let's meditate on those two
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.560]   passages, letting 2 Corinthians 13 5 protect us from a cavalier failure to do
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.800]   any serious self-examination, and letting 1 Corinthians 4 3 protect us
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   from devastating self-judgment and self-condemnation, which belong only to
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.480]   God. And then here's another passage that has been so helpful to me. Romans 7
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:49.400]   21 through chapter 8 verse 1. On the one hand, this text is heartbreaking, and on
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.440]   the other hand, hope-giving. Paul says, "I find it to be a law that when I want to
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.720]   do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inner
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:08.840]   being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.560]   mind, and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.760]   man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:29.120]   through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, I myself serve the law of God in my mind,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:37.160]   but with my flesh I serve the law of sin. There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.080]   for those who are in Christ Jesus." So it seems to me—and there's a big dispute
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.240]   about how to interpret Romans 7, I know, but I'm giving you my interpretation, you
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.960]   judge for yourself—it seems to me that Paul is showing us that Christians walk
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.520]   through Romans 7, seasons in which we feel the overbearing power of remaining
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.720]   in dwelling sin that makes us cry out, "Oh, wretched man that I am," without losing
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.680]   the sure reality that victory has been decisively given. Thanks be to God
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.360]   through Jesus Christ, it has been decisively given and will someday be
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   fully experienced through Jesus Christ our Lord. So that we can say, "Therefore," in
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.760]   spite of all this struggle in Romans 7, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:46.480]   to those who are in Christ Jesus." And I think it is a great help when we
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.280]   diagnose ourselves in the way Paul does, to have categories in our minds from
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.120]   Romans 7 that help us to understand the nature of our struggle. And the last
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.200]   thing I would do is draw Nolan's attention to Romans 8, 14 to 17. It goes like this,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.640]   "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.040]   receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:20.960]   spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we say, 'Abba, Father.'" The Spirit himself bears
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.080]   witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, and if children, then
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.400]   heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.480]   order that we may be glorified with him. Now I think Paul is saying that in the
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.240]   end, at the end of the day, when all introspection is over, the confidence
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:52.880]   that we are the children of God is a gift of the Holy Spirit. You can't make
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.720]   it happen merely through rational introspection. It is a gift, but he does
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:06.600]   not just leave us hanging at that. He gives the ordinary pathway along which
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.200]   the Spirit gives this confidence. He says, "All who are led by the Spirit of God are
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.600]   the sons of God." All who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. And
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.640]   the being led that he has in mind in this context is not like, "Oh, to be a
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.200]   missionary or to marry this woman or to live in this location." No, no, no, no, none of
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.800]   that at all. The being led that he has in mind in this context is, number one, being
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   led by the Spirit into warfare with sin. "He who puts the death to deeds of the
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.800]   body will live." Being led by the Spirit into warfare with sin, and secondly, being
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.520]   led by the Spirit into the humble and dependent cry, like a little child, "Abba,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:08.920]   Father." So, Nolan, hate your sin. Make war on specific sins by the power of the
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:16.160]   Holy Spirit, and constantly look away from yourself to your Father in Heaven,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   and to Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection make it possible to call
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.400]   him not only a just judge, but an all-caring Father.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. And you can now head off to Louisville or Louville,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.320]   however you say it. If you're headed to T4G as well, may the Lord bless you with
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.600]   safe travels, and may the Conference refuel you, and may you meet Christ in a
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   special way. Be looking for Pastor John's plenary message on Friday afternoon on
