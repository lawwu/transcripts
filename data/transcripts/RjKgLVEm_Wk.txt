[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.980]   the Gospel according to St John in the first chapter and the sixteenth verse, "And of
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.420]   his fullness of all we received, and grace for grace."
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.980]   Now we've been looking at this great statement for several months, and there is no Sunday
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.860]   perhaps on which this is a more appropriate text than on this particular Sunday.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.900]   John here in the prologue, as we've been seeing Sunday to Sunday, is reminding us that
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.220]   everything we have and everything we are as Christians is entirely due to the coming of
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.940]   the Lord Jesus Christ into this world.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.780]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and were it not for that fact, we would have
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.380]   nothing at all.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:00.420]   It is of his fullness that we have received, and grace for or upon grace.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.980]   And we've been working this out in various ways.
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.220]   And in particular we are now concerned to show that this fullness that was in him is
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.820]   something that has been applied to us.
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.740]   It is in him, it has always been him.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.260]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.140]   There's nothing beyond that, that is all fullness.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.860]   But of course, as I say, unless something had happened, we could never have received
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.540]   of it, we could never have partaken of it.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.580]   And that is where we come to this great message of the incarnation, the coming of the Son
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.180]   of God into this world, and all he has made possible for us.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.980]   Now we've been tracing that he had to do certain things, and he has done them all.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.180]   Everything that was necessary for us and for our salvation, he has done, and he has
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.740]   done so perfectly.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.780]   And he is seated at the right hand of the glory everlasting at this very moment.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.580]   There, making ever living to make intercession for his people, and waiting until his enemies
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.660]   shall be made his footstool.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.820]   Waiting until the day when he will come back again into this world and complete this great
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.180]   and glorious work.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.940]   But thank God, in the meantime, we are able to receive of him, and we receive of his fullness,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.940]   grace upon grace.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.460]   So that though we are still in a world of sin and still traveling through time, and
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.100]   still moving in the direction of this eternal and final glory, we are enabled to live in
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.380]   his power and in his strength.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.380]   And as the Apostle Paul reminds us, and as I've been reminding you, of him, of God,
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.540]   in other words, are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God hath been made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.700]   sanctification, and redemption.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.880]   And we are concerned at the moment particularly about this aspect of wisdom.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.500]   And this is something that does need to be emphasized so much at the present time in
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.940]   the world as it is today.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.780]   And we have therefore been taking our time over this in order to bring out this aspect
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.860]   of the truth.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.900]   There is no understanding of life apart from him.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.140]   And that is because there is no knowledge of God apart from him.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.260]   But in him there is knowledge of God.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.420]   This great 18th verse here puts that once and forever.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.980]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.980]   The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.100]   He gives us a knowledge of God, and that is the basis and the fundamental requisite of
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.660]   all true wisdom and understanding of life.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.900]   And then we've gone on to see that it is in him alone that we have wisdom and understanding
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.020]   also with respect to ourselves.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.260]   Now this is an astounding thing.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.160]   Man thinks that he knows himself and that he understands himself, but he doesn't.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.300]   And we have seen that the ultimate confession of the Scriptures is, "Search me and try
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300]   me and show me."
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.780]   The ways of men are not in himself, says the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.340]   The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.340]   Who can know it?
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.980]   And there's only one who can.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.060]   I, the Lord, search the hearts.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.780]   I try the range.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.100]   And it is in the Lord Jesus Christ alone that we are given this knowledge concerning ourselves.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.740]   And he has done so in many ways.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.780]   He gives us this knowledge in many different ways.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:42.300]   Now I ended last Sunday morning by pointing out that he is the second man.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.620]   He is the last Adam.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.600]   He called himself the son of man.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.660]   And therefore he does stand before us as one who gives us, and who alone can give us, a
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.940]   true understanding concerning man.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.580]   Now this is put in many, many ways in the Scriptures.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.620]   You read these wonderful things that are said in the Scriptures about men, how God made
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.460]   him in his own image, made him Lord of creation, made all things for him, as it were, and then
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.540]   you see the state of the world.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.580]   And you say, "I can't reconcile these things."
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.340]   And there's only one ultimate reconciliation.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.300]   And the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it like this.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.340]   We see Jesus.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.720]   It's the only answer.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.660]   You look at the world and you say, "We do not see all things put under men.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.060]   We see things almost the exact opposite of that."
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.000]   But he says, "This is our comfort and our hope and our consolation.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.860]   We see Jesus."
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.820]   And it is by looking at him that we begin to get an understanding of the world and its
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.460]   course and its history and of men especially.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.500]   What he is, what he's going to be.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.540]   And how God is going to fulfill all his promises with respect to men in and through our blessed
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.820]   Lord and Savior.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.820]   So the most important thing for us to do is to look at him.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.200]   We see Jesus as this man.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.020]   And because we see Jesus, well, we have an understanding and we've got a hope and we
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.940]   look forward to that world to come.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.620]   But the question that immediately occurs to us, what do we see in Jesus?
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.260]   And here at once we find a division.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:30.100]   Far from the very moment that he came into this world, this Jesus has caused division.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.640]   He has divided the human race.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   He said so himself.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.860]   "Think not," he said, "that I am come to send peace into the earth.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.460]   I came not to send peace, but a sword."
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.260]   He is one who divides, even in families as he points out.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.660]   He causes a division.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.660]   And he has always been from the very beginning a source of division.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.380]   Now this is the great tragedy of the world.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.580]   God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.420]   The hymn the host sings, the angel makes his announcement.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.340]   "Don't fear," he says, "I'm the bearer of good and glad tidings.
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.980]   Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord."
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.120]   And yet the whole world, instead of falling at his feet and acclaiming him and worshipping
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.220]   him and rejoicing in him, doesn't do so.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.420]   The world is divided this morning, and this is the only ultimate division into those who
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.860]   believe in him and who are Christians and those who don't and those who reject him.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:41.440]   Thus I say from the very beginning he has caused a division.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.100]   And so we are conscious this morning, this Sunday before Christmas, as we look at him
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:54.620]   and as the world in general looks in his direction and is in its way looking at Jesus, that there
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.580]   are two main ways in which people see him.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.620]   He still causes the division this morning that he has caused from the very commencement.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.940]   Now why is that?
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.920]   Well, I can do nothing better than put it to you still in the terms that the great apostle
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.420]   puts it in that first epistle to the Corinthians in the first chapter.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.580]   And the phrase that I pick out especially this morning is that phrase in the 20th verse.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:25.540]   The apostle now is challenging the wise, the Greeks, the philosophers, those who are not
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.100]   Christians, those who have rejected the Christian gospel, and he is challenging them in these
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100]   terms.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:37.960]   He says, "It is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.080]   the understanding of the prudent.'"
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   Where is the wise?
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.400]   Where is the scribe?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.800]   Where is the disputer of this world, the clever man, the debater, the arguer, the philosopher,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.520]   the disputer of this world?
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   Where is he?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:59.800]   "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.880]   And then he goes on to point out how that God has done that in and through our Lord
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880]   Jesus Christ.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.760]   "For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.120]   by the foolishness of preaching and of the thing preached to save them that believe."
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.480]   And it's all in and through this Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.380]   Now then, the whole case, you see, for Christianity in a sense is this.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.040]   This is God's wisdom, and it's not only different from and unlike the wisdom of the
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.040]   world.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040]   You must go further.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.880]   "It has made foolish the wisdom of this world."
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.480]   It ridicules it.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.080]   It turns it upside down and shows that it's altogether wrong.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.460]   Now this is an aspect of the truth that is often neglected.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.840]   The world, of course, in its cleverness and in its wisdom would like to adopt the Christian
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.520]   message, and there are so many that encourage it to do so, as if Christianity is but an
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.600]   addition to what the world has already.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.040]   The fact of the matter is it isn't.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.920]   It is something that makes foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:11.000]   And you can only add the gospel to the wisdom of the world by making a travesty of your
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.240]   gospel, by turning it into something that it really is not.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.280]   Let's never forget this.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.560]   The gospel is a sore.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.820]   It is a dividing.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.920]   And it is something that turns the world upside down, makes foolish, ridicules the wisdom
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.420]   of this world.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.320]   And if we don't understand this aspect of the Christian message, we really have never
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.600]   understood it at all.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.300]   This is something, I say, that cuts across everything that the world holds on to, by
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.640]   its own wisdom and understanding, by its own nature and by its own thinking.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.460]   And that is why it is as true as ever to say this morning that God hath made foolish the
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.940]   wisdom of this world, and that we see him doing this supremely in and through our Lord
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.620]   and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.600]   Now everything about our Lord makes the wisdom of this world look foolish.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.940]   This morning I am going to concentrate only upon the way in which his birth did that.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.980]   And it's a very remarkable and a striking thing.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.780]   I think it is one of the most helpful ways of considering the message of Christmas, the
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.420]   whole message of the Incarnation.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:25.340]   It has happened in such a way and in such a manner that the world, I say, is made to
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.260]   look utterly foolish.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:33.580]   Or putting it in a positive way, it makes it abundantly clear that the only wisdom is
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.980]   the wisdom that is in our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.980]   And therefore if we want to be wise, we've got to submit ourselves to him and realise
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:49.180]   that apart from him we've got nothing at all of his fullness, of all we receive, and
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.220]   grace upon grace.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.860]   I ask therefore, do you understand life?
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.400]   Do you understand men?
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.820]   Do you understand history?
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.440]   Do you understand the future?
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.980]   Are we thinking about all these things in a Christian manner or in a non-Christian manner?
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   It's one or the other.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.820]   Now then, let's work this out together.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.820]   Let us see how his very coming into the world has made the wisdom of this world look utterly
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.820]   foolish.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   How?
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.660]   Well, here's the first aspect in which he has done so.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:28.740]   He has exposed the false glory of men and of the world.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.740]   He's made it look ridiculous.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   He's made it look foolish.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.140]   How has he done so?
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:40.620]   Well, let's start by considering what is man's idea of glory?
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.300]   And there is no difficulty at all about answering that question.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:51.340]   Man's idea of glory is always in terms of bigness.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.780]   Nothing is really glorious to man as he is by nature unless it's big.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.900]   And especially so at the present time.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.020]   We are living in an age in which there is a cult of bigness.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.740]   People are mad on figures and statistics and unless they're always going up, they have
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.740]   no value.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.820]   Bigness is the thing that matters.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.300]   It's inevitable in an age of propaganda and of advertising.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:19.180]   But the world has always attached great significance to bigness and with that, of course, power.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.260]   The great and the glorious is that which has power.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.020]   And therefore it has always looked for power when it thinks of any kind of glory.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:35.940]   And then accompanying this, of course, you get pomp and circumstance, marvellous display.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.540]   That's how you express the glory of a country or anything.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.540]   You see it in the papers and on the television, how these different nations on their particular
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.980]   days are giving an expression of their greatness and of their glory.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.620]   So you see their armies marching, their tanks rolling along and all their instruments of
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.620]   war.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.620]   This is glory.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.820]   This is greatness.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.540]   This is the sign of bigness and of authority.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.180]   Pomp and circumstance, flags flying, bands playing and armies marching with all their
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.180]   terrible armaments.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:12.580]   That's the way in which the world has always thought of greatness and of glory.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.580]   That is what is wonderful to it.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:21.620]   And of course, in addition to that, the understanding comes in the place of wisdom.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.620]   Man is always proud of his understanding.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:31.700]   His inventions, his discoveries, all these are indicative of his innate capacity and
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.500]   power and the propensities that are in him.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.220]   That is why the nations vie with one another in sending a man up into outer space, the
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.680]   first to arrive at the moon and so on.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.980]   This is a part of status and of authority and position.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:51.260]   So man is always gloried in his possessions and in his power, his physical power, his
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:57.820]   military power and his intellectual and mental power and in his ability to discover things,
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.220]   especially in the realm of knowledge.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.060]   And in addition to all this, I needn't worry with this sorry list, but this is the world
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:13.740]   that thinks of greatness and glory and pomp in terms of palaces, great magnificent buildings,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.100]   endless rooms, wonderful decorations, paintings gathered and garnered from everywhere in the
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.100]   world.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.100]   Palaces.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.100]   That's majesty.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   That is real glory.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.100]   The bigger the house, the greater the man and so on.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:33.460]   And throw in with that pedigree, you can sum it all up in a sense in this way, that history
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   in the main has been the history of kings and of warriors, of battles and wars and triumphs
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.460]   and conquests and things of that kind.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:48.860]   And the greatness of a man or of a nation has generally been judged in terms of the
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.220]   various things that I've been reminding you of at this moment.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.860]   Well now, there is the world.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.820]   That human greatness, that human glory.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.500]   Think of the great civilizations of the past.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.220]   You get it described perfectly in many places in the Old Testament.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.620]   Look at the glory of a man like Nebuchadnezzar and how he estimated his glory.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:16.300]   Look at the sense of glory expressed in the book of Ecclesiastes, how that wise man gives
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.180]   us perfect portrayals of what men by nature regards as glory.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.740]   He'd built palaces, he'd built cities, he'd had pleasure, he'd had music, he'd had money.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.020]   That's the way that you express all this glory.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.500]   And you get it in secular history outside.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:36.100]   The glory that was Greece, the magnificent buildings there in Athens and so on.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.380]   The glory of Rome, the Colosseum.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.980]   All this, bigness, greatness, majestic buildings, everything pointing thus to the achievement
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.060]   of men and of the glory of men.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.660]   Now that's the way in which the world has always thought of greatness and glory, of
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.660]   majesty.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:01.620]   The apostle tells us, "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.740]   And nowhere has he done so more wonderfully or more perfectly than in the coming of his
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:13.260]   only begotten dearly beloved Son into this world."
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.900]   The astounding thing is this, that what you see when you look at that babe lying in the
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:26.740]   manger there in that stable in Bethlehem, is the exact opposite of everything that the
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.940]   world regards as great or glorious or wonderful.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:36.220]   Now let me just notice some of the contrast to you.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:41.500]   The very nation out of which he was born is in itself a rebuff to human greatness and
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   glory.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:53.420]   He was born a Jew, and he was born in that little land of Palestine, a little country.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:59.580]   And a country that had been there as a kind of buffer between the great powers, Egypt
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.940]   on the one hand, and the Assyrian and the Babylonian powers on the other.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.300]   And it was this little country that came always in between, and was in danger of being crushed,
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.060]   and was so often crushed from both sides.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.860]   A nation despised, a small and an insignificant nation.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.620]   And at this particular time, a nation of course that had been conquered by the great Roman
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.820]   Empire.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:32.540]   She wasn't a nation that could boast of a great culture such as that of Greece, the
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.500]   mecca of all learning and wisdom and knowledge.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.940]   She wasn't a great country and had no great history to boast of, as the Roman Empire had
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.940]   at that time.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:47.140]   She couldn't boast of her almost perfect civil service, as we now call it, and her whole
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.020]   notion of government and of planning and of organization.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.340]   There's nothing like that in her history.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.460]   Great nations were everywhere else, as it were.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:06.980]   And here she is, just a despised little country, sandwiched in there amongst these great empires.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.300]   The Greeks divided the ancient world into the wise and the barbarians.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.940]   Well, the Jews went in with the barbarians.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.180]   They were not Greeks.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.940]   They hadn't this particular knowledge and learning and understanding.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.740]   So you see, the very country, the very place in which he is born, is in and of itself a
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:29.380]   rebuff to men and the world's idea of greatness and of glory.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.220]   And then, who is his mother?
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:40.140]   And the answer is that she's just, as one of our hymns puts it, a lowly Hebrew maid,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.140]   Mary.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.380]   Nobody had ever heard of her.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.940]   A very ordinary person.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.860]   Not some great outstanding beauty or anything like that.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.420]   We know nothing about her, as a matter of fact.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.460]   Nothing at all.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.580]   Nobody would ever have thought of such a thing.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.580]   You would have thought that at any rate she should have been a king's daughter or something
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.580]   like that.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.780]   But that isn't the case at all.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.860]   Child of lowly Hebrew maid.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.780]   Somebody entirely and completely unknown.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.460]   Now, this is an astonishing thing, this.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.300]   But it's so characteristic of God's way of bringing to nothing the wisdom of the world
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.700]   and bringing to naught man's idea of greatness and of glory.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.500]   He makes foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.700]   He has the exact opposite of what you get in the secular history of the world.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.500]   Whether you look at it in terms of culture or of thought or of military prowess or greatness
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.540]   or anything alike, he has the exact opposite of it all.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:46.740]   And of course, the very fact that he comes as a babe is in itself quite a shock to the
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   world.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.900]   Nobody would have thought that if God is going to visit this world in order to redeem it,
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.260]   he would come as some great spectacle coming through the heavens, standing out there and
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.580]   the whole world waiting and looking at it.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:04.100]   But if I may so put it, the Son of God, when he came into this world, slipped into it unknown
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.140]   and unobserved, and nobody knew that he'd come.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.180]   You remember the story, don't you, how there was no room for them in the inn?
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.660]   There was a gathering of people there and they'd come from various places and they were
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.720]   all talking about the taxing.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.020]   You see, when the Son of God was born into this world, nobody was talking about it at
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   all.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.180]   Nobody knew that it had happened.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.220]   This was something that had happened, as I say, in secret almost.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.140]   And not a word was said about it.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.860]   The people in Bethlehem crowding the various inns, the people who'd booked their rooms
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.140]   and who were not ready to make way even for this poor woman who was about to give birth
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.060]   to her firstborn child, they were not talking about that.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.020]   They were talking about everything else and the world is always talking about the wrong
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.860]   things.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.740]   The world never talks about the things that rarely matter.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.340]   The world today is talking about everything except about this person and about his gospel,
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.100]   and that's why the world is as it is.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:03.060]   Well, you see, he comes as a helpless babe and is put in a manger, and the world doesn't
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.780]   understand things like that.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.180]   That's not its idea of greatness and of glory.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.820]   That's not its idea of incarnation.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.300]   It's the opposite, and because it's the opposite, it makes foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.820]   The almighty God, who could have done so many other things, chose to do it like this in
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:24.260]   order to expose the hollowness of man's notions of greatness and of glory.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:31.020]   And then, of course, as I've been anticipating, he wasn't born in a palace.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.100]   He was born in a stable, not even in an inn.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.980]   You see, you can't imagine a greater extreme, a greater antithesis from the pomp and ceremony
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.700]   and glory and wonder of your magnificent palaces, and a stable.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.460]   My dear friends, these things didn't happen by accident.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.780]   This is God making foolish the wisdom of this world, showing, in other words, that it isn't
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.700]   wisdom at all, that the real wisdom is in that babe in the manger.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.700]   There is the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and the fullness of the wisdom and the knowledge
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.700]   of God.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.860]   It's there in that babe.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.820]   If you want wisdom, look there.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.820]   That's what he's saying.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.980]   He's preaching by the way in which he did it, and he's making foolish the wisdom of
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.660]   this world.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:22.980]   And then, of course, not only the stable, but the poverty.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:28.620]   You know, according to the law of God laid down in the book of Leviticus, when a child
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.060]   like this was born in connection with the purification of the mother, it had been laid
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.100]   down by the law that two offerings should be provided.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:42.880]   One should be a lamb, and the other should be a turtle dove or a pigeon.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.180]   One of each, a lamb and a turtle dove or a pigeon.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.620]   But the regulations have said this.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:55.820]   And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles or two young pigeons.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.020]   In other words, the regulations said, if it should happen that the mother, the parents
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.700]   should be so poor that they can't afford to sacrifice a lamb, well then in that case
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:12.220]   they don't bring a lamb and a pigeon, they bring two pigeons or two turtle doves.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:19.580]   And the everlasting Son of God, the Word, when he was made flesh, was born to a mother
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.620]   that was so poor that she couldn't afford a lamb.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.780]   It had to be the two turtle doves or pigeons, according to the provision of the law.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:37.020]   You see, here is human greatness, wealth, majesty, pomp, circumstance, utterly ridiculed,
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.380]   made foolish.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.820]   Every detail is the exact opposite of what we would have expected.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.860]   And as you follow him on and trace his life, you'll find exactly the same thing.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.300]   He lived a very ordinary life.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.380]   We know very little about it, because it was so ordinary.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.380]   He just lived the life of an ordinary boy in Nazareth, and then when he became of age
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:08.140]   he began to work as a carpenter, worked with his hands, craftsman, artisan.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:13.460]   He didn't spend his time as the son of a king or of a prince, hunting, shooting, making
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.460]   war and so on.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:22.180]   No, just the most ordinary life, the most drab life that you can ever imagine.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.820]   Not only that, he never received any training.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.180]   There were those who were trained as Pharisees, and they had to go to the various schools.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.940]   You read about them in the New Testament.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.180]   The school of Hillel and so on.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.420]   Cameliel and these others.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:44.420]   He never had any training, never went to any sort of academy, and was never given any learning
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.220]   at all.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:52.300]   Now, this is sure fact, my friends, but this means that God is making foolish the wisdom
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   of this world.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:59.500]   The world says, "Unless a man is given this particular training, he cannot make a contribution."
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:05.660]   And yet the saviour of the world had no training at all, never went to the schools.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.660]   So that they taunted him with it, "How are these men learning, never having learned?"
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.660]   they said.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.660]   But so it is.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.740]   It's always the exact opposite of what we think is an absolute essential.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.060]   And so I remind you that he was not as a king.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.620]   He had no army.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.620]   He had no throne.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:28.020]   And still more extraordinary, he spent his time amongst the poor people.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.100]   This was again a source of difficulty to the wise of the world.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.380]   It was a source of difficulty even to his own brothers who came later.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.860]   They said, "If you are what you claim you are, why don't you go up to Jerusalem and
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.060]   make yourself known?"
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.660]   The people came one day and tried to take him by force to make him a king, but he wouldn't.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.460]   He went away himself alone up on top of a mountain.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.940]   And his followers consisted chiefly of poor people.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.060]   Not the great people, not the great authorities.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.260]   Stillness, a congregation or a gathering of Greek philosophers preached the gospel to
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:06.300]   the poor and was followed by a group and a crowd of poor people.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.260]   These things baffled the authorities.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.460]   They baffled the mayas in Greece and they have baffled men and women ever since.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.260]   There he is, this enigma.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:22.180]   So in all this, it's quite clear that God is making foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.980]   And of course, as the apostle goes on to point out, but we don't deal with it particularly
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.080]   this morning, if God did all this in his birth and in his life, how much more so in his death?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.940]   That was the final stumbling block.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.740]   That was the final root of offense.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.060]   That the one who claims to be the savior dies in weakness.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.420]   Saviors are men, great generals who lead armies and who conquer everybody and then set captives
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.420]   free.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:54.540]   Here is one who dies in utter weakness, in complete helplessness.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.780]   Indeed we are told of him that his visage was so marred that none should desire him.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.540]   He was described as this fellow.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.080]   These are the words and expressions that are used with respect to him.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.620]   Indeed he never possessed any dwelling in this world.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.460]   We read of the people one night, every man went to his own house.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.060]   Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.060]   Why?
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.060]   Because he hadn't got a house.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.420]   He never owned a house.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.500]   The son of men, he says, hath nowhere to lay his head.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.060]   Foxes of wolves and the birds of the air have nests, but the son of men hath not whereon
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.300]   to lay his head.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.920]   He had no possessions whatsoever.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.340]   And so it's not surprising that the great apostle says, hath not God made foolish the
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.840]   wisdom of this world?
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   But now wait a minute.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.620]   There's only one side of the matter.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:50.860]   His coming, I say, shows the hollowness and exposes the false glory of men and of the
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.860]   world.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.980]   But you see, at the same time, it reveals the true glory.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.460]   It shows that the wisdom of the world is all wrong, but it shows what the true wisdom really
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.460]   is.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.780]   Now, this is the difficulty that people have always had with respect to our Lord, and this
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.060]   is why he divides the world this morning, as he's always done.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.620]   There is, and I must use the term because I can't convey the meaning without it, it
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.880]   is the paradox.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:21.620]   It is the coming together of these eternal opposites that constitutes the enigma.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.240]   Wisdom according to the Bible is not something of outward appearance.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.380]   It's something hidden.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.740]   It's something that the world cannot see.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.860]   And so the world doesn't understand that the whole of the wisdom of the Godhead should
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.180]   come as a helpless babe.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.700]   It looks and only sees a babe.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.220]   It looks and only sees a carpenter.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.540]   It sees an ordinary man.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.140]   It doesn't see the hidden.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:46.340]   Here, says this man, John, writing, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.340]   of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.460]   But that's only true of we, of us, who are Christians.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.460]   Nobody else saw it.
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.080]   They said, 'Away with him, crucify him, this fellow, the paradox.'
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.820]   But it's essential that I should bring up this other side of the paradox also.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.380]   I've emphasized one side only so far because, you see, it is there that God is really making
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.100]   foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   But behold the wisdom of God positively.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.620]   I say this child, as it were, slipped into the world and nobody knew about it, but wait
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.900]   a moment.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:30.060]   His coming had actually been announced beforehand.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:36.740]   I mean by that that the archangel Gabriel had visited Mary and had told her all about
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.300]   him.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.980]   You see, this is where the paradox comes in.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.300]   The lowly Hebrew maid, nobody knows about her.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.420]   Ah, but heaven knows about her.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.380]   This is salvation, you see.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.660]   The world may know nothing about you, my dear friend, but if you're a Christian, God knows
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.660]   you.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.460]   And your name is written in his book and the names of many people in the world he deems
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.180]   as great are not in his book.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.940]   And he'll say to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.940]   Depart from me.'
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:08.380]   His birth, his coming was announced, it was foretold, all of Old Testament prophecy.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:16.380]   But the special emissary sent, the archangel Gabriel sent to Mary, the lowly Hebrew maid,
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.980]   and he gives her this wonderful information.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.260]   You see, there are two sides to this.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:26.620]   This which looks so ordinary and which baffles the wisdom of men and causes them to stumble.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.180]   If only they could see, if only they knew.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.380]   But they don't know and they won't be taught.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.820]   That's the difficulty.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:42.260]   Not only was his birth announced, it was a miraculous birth.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.620]   He was born of a virgin.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.780]   He had no earthly father.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.620]   There was never a birth like this.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.380]   This is a unique birth.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.620]   It seems quite ordinary.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.660]   A lowly Hebrew maid gives birth to a child in a stable.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.660]   'Ah, but my dear friend, look at the other side.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.660]   Never had a father.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.140]   Born of a virgin.'
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.300]   And that of course leads to the next thing, conceived of the Holy Ghost.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.340]   Mary didn't understand it.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.740]   Mary stumbled at it like everybody else has stumbled at it.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.900]   The angel had to say to her, 'Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.140]   And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.140]   Jesus, etc.'
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:28.900]   Then Mary said unto the angel, 'How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?'
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:34.180]   And the angel answered and said unto her, 'The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.340]   the power of the highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:43.060]   Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.060]   God.'
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.500]   Now here it is, you see, this is God's wisdom.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.540]   And if you bring your human wisdom and try to understand it, you're baffled.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.940]   It's wrong in every respect.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.000]   What you see isn't the whole truth.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.700]   The unseen is the thing that matters.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:10.140]   And so we know that he was born and conceived of the Holy Ghost, and that he is pure and
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:16.060]   without sin, that he's not just an ordinary child, that holy thing that shall be born
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.700]   of thee.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.900]   And then, of course, we remember these other wonderful things that we are told here in
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.260]   connection with this current.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.540]   I say the clever, wealthy, busy people, the great, were there in their inns and talking
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.020]   and drinking and discussing the tax and all the rest of it, and some of them perhaps were
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.900]   political agitators, and they knew nothing about this thing that was happening in the
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.900]   stable.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:41.540]   But the angels knew, and the angels were singing.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.740]   They were in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.740]   by night.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.580]   And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.580]   them, and they were sore afraid.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.300]   And the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.020]   shall be to all people.'
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.620]   And then you remember what happened afterwards, and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:12.100]   of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.020]   peace, goodwill toward men.'
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.860]   No attention paid in Bethlehem, in the inn, amongst the wise of this world, but out in
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:26.740]   the fields the angels are singing, the heavenly host is singing its anthem, heralding the
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:33.500]   birth and the coming of this Son of God, the Saviour of the world.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.740]   That's why the world doesn't understand him.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:40.900]   They will go and try to measure him with their human measurements, and it doesn't fit in.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.360]   It's all wrong.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.660]   They think they see, but they don't see.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.420]   The apostle tells the Corinthians in the second chapter of that first epistle that his wisdom
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.180]   is a hidden wisdom, and it is.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.620]   The things of Christ, the glory of God, the wisdom of God is a hidden wisdom.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.580]   If you come with your human categories, you'll never see it.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.580]   It's hid as it were in a parcel, and you've got to see through.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.580]   It's there.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   It's unobserved.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:07.580]   The world doesn't see it.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.020]   It comes with its measures, and it dismisses it as folly and as nonsense.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.140]   But in so doing, God is making foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.300]   Even the princes of this world did not know him, for had they known him, they would not
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.580]   have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.580]   They didn't see.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.580]   They were blind.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.580]   That's the tragedy.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:32.620]   But, as I say, the angels knew, and they sang, and they heralded, and so did the wise men.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.940]   The wise men came from the east, and they were guided by a star.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.940]   Heaven was looking down upon this, and heaven was glowing in this.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.900]   This was the most amazing thing that even heaven had ever known.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.340]   You remember how Peter puts it in the first epistle in the first chapter in verses 10
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.780]   and 11 and 12?
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.060]   The angels desire to look into it.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.060]   This is astounding.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.460]   This is amazing baffling, not only to men, but also to angels.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.060]   The wise men and the star, they had been given the knowledge.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:08.740]   They had received the revelation, and so the wise men are guided by the star, appointed
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.060]   by God to bring them to this infant child.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.020]   And on it grows.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.780]   This child, we are told, he grew and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.180]   the grace of God was upon him.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.580]   And there he is at the age of twelve, later on in the temple, arguing with the doctors
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.620]   of the law, and refuting them, and confuting them.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.940]   And nobody understands the wisdom that is in this child.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.700]   He's always a puzzle and a problem and an enigma.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.220]   He seems ordinary, yet he isn't.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.620]   There's always this glory that is there, shining through in glimpses, as it were.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.060]   And then you remember his remark to his parents on the way home, when he said, "Wist ye not
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:52.060]   that I must be about the things of my father, or about my father's business?"
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.380]   They didn't know what he meant.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.380]   He knew.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.660]   This child, age twelve, knowledge and understanding, though he's never been trained, and he's about
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.660]   his father's business.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.660]   He's got a commission.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.500]   How do you explain these things?
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.820]   The world cannot, and it therefore rejects them.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:10.580]   But that's where God is showing the wisdom of this world to be foolish.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:17.500]   And so, when he comes to the age of thirty and sets out on his public ministry, he is
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.900]   most baffling of all.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.460]   He has amazing teaching.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.300]   The common people sense something.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.740]   They said, "This man speaketh with authorities, not as the Pharisees and scribes."
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.460]   The Pharisees and scribes said, "How is this man learning, never having learned?
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.980]   What right has he to speak?"
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.940]   Though he was speaking with authority, and they felt the authority, they said, "He hasn't
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:44.380]   the right to speak the legalism of the wisdom of this world," baffled by his teaching.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.260]   And then, of course, he has miracles.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:54.220]   He has miracles of power, giving sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, enabling the
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:38:01.500]   lame to run, raising the very dead, controlling the elements, the wind and the sea.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   Miracles, power!
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.660]   And yet, I say, dying in weakness, and apparently unable to save himself and to defend himself,
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.220]   and the wise world stands by and says, "Others he saved himself, he cannot save.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.140]   If thou be the Christ of God, come down, save thyself."
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:22.700]   "He can't," they said, and they mocked and jeered and laughed.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:31.820]   But you see, in all this, from the very stable in Bethlehem to the resurrection, God is making
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.100]   foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.860]   It's the exact opposite of what the world has ever thought.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.180]   The world says, "Very well, then, he's just a man."
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.180]   The answer is, "He isn't."
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.420]   "Well, then," says the world, "he's a god in the form of a man."
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.420]   The answer is, "He isn't."
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.180]   The world was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.780]   He is truly God and truly man.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.900]   And the world can't take the paradox.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:04.740]   It can't take this astounding thing put by Charles Wesley, "veiled in flesh that God
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.740]   had seen."
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.420]   Hail incarnate deity.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:15.500]   So everything, every circumstance attending his coming is nothing but a god showing the
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.380]   utter foolishness of the wisdom of this world.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:25.820]   It's this constant paradox, man only, God only, strength, weakness, failure, success.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:31.780]   They're all there, and they're all there in this one person, two natures in one person.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.740]   In other words, my dear friend, the lesson is this.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   If you try to understand the Lord Jesus Christ, you're just showing that you're still subject
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.740]   to the wisdom of this world.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.500]   You don't understand him, you just marvel at him.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:50.580]   And you just take your position with the apostle Paul and you say, "Great is the mystery of
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.340]   godliness.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:59.540]   God was manifest in the flesh."
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:08.180]   And if I may so put it, the final thrust of God in making foolish the wisdom of this world
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.620]   is this.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:20.340]   No one can ever know him or understand him except he receive the revelation that God
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.340]   alone can give.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:33.100]   And the first people to whom the revelation was given were not a gathering of philosophers
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:41.140]   in Athens, not a conclave of statesmen in Rome, not even an august gathering of Pharisees
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:48.580]   and scribes and Sadducees in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:54.740]   Just a number of ordinary ignorant shepherds in a field watching their flock by night.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:00.820]   It was to them, first of all, that the secret was unfolded.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.260]   That the little babe that had been born in the stable, in the straw, and amongst the
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:13.540]   lowing of the cattle, and whose little body had been placed in the manger, was none other
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.940]   than Christ the Lord.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:26.940]   God gave the secret, first of all, to the humblest, the lowliest, the most despised.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.940]   Thank God that he did so.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:37.060]   For he tells us that we are all saved by grace, that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation,
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:46.180]   that we none of us can save ourselves, but that God can save anybody because it is his
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:52.900]   wisdom and his power.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:42:02.180]   So the message of the babe of Bethlehem this morning is, "I am the light of the world.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:09.140]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:17.180]   Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.740]   And it is a wisdom that makes foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.540]   Blessed be the name of God.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:35.140]   Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.100]   Amen.
