[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   What is the relationship between stress and eating and eating and the opioid system?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   Stress and eating is an interesting one.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.600]   So most people when they feel stressed or, you know, I'm just going to ask you, do you
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.840]   eat more or less when you're stressed?
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.200]   Less, definitely.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.940]   I feel like I can go two, three days without food when I'm really stressed.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.640]   But I came up in a profession where sadly for me, all-nighters were part of the regular
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.160]   until pretty recently, a couple of years ago when I just called an end to that.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.080]   And no, it wasn't just because of procrastination, it was just work overload.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.800]   But I can go a long period of time without eating, although I love to eat.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.720]   So I do point out that I do love to eat.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.760]   And what does the body feel like when you're in that stress state, when you're not even
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.280]   hungry, you're kind of shut down in your digestion?
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.800]   That I have enough energy from my neural resources, from adrenaline.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   And generally, those periods of time when I'm not hungry coincide with a hyper focus
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.280]   on the stressor, the deadline, whatever it is in life that needs tending to.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.560]   And food just doesn't appeal to me as much.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.200]   It doesn't taste as good and it's not as enticing.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   So we think that your type of body temperament is high sympathetic.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.400]   And so when you have a big stress response, your digestion is pretty much shut down.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200]   It would be the opposite.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.720]   Eating would be the opposite of what your body's telling you to do.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960]   I'm just going to, forgive me for interrupting.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.280]   For those of you hearing sympathetic, we're not talking about sympathy.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.840]   We're talking about the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is the
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   so-called fight or flight arm, as opposed to the parasympathetic.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.040]   In any event, sorry to interrupt, but wanted to make sure that sometimes people hear sympathy
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.300]   and then they think emotional sympathy.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.840]   I like to think I have that too.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   But okay.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.560]   So I tend to lean more towards the sympathetic, meaning more alertness arousal on the seesaw
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.200]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.960]   And I'm a high sympathetic reactor.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.940]   I lose weight when I go through, like writing my dissertation, I looked like a skeleton
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.380]   at the end.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.740]   But that's not what most people complain about.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.740]   It's not weight loss.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.960]   Most people complain about overeating or binge eating when they're emotional, when they're
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   stressed.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.160]   And that's the more common pattern.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.860]   And what that, that looks different, both in the brain and biologically.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.480]   And so what it looks like is that the stress response is driving cravings.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.800]   And also, let's say high insulin or an insulin resistant state.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.340]   And what goes along with that is tending to be overweight or have obesity.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.080]   And so just by whether it's through conditioning or genetics, having that kind of larger body
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.840]   with a big stress eating temperament, that is a challenge in life.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.800]   And I've been, you know, I've worked with people with different eating conditions, eating
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.560]   disorders, binge eating.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.840]   And it is a, what's hard about it is number one, it's very common and normative to just
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.120]   feel like you can't feel satiated.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.220]   So it's this compulsive eating tendency that stress brings you to.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.740]   And so the, so what it means, we measure this, it's very easy to measure, it means that people
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.800]   feel like they can't control their eating, they don't get full, they think about food
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.060]   a lot.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.940]   And so stress kind of exacerbates that tendency.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.780]   And that is a, you know, it's a common phenotype.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.940]   Like we've studied it and maybe 50% of people with obesity have that.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.900]   Do lean people have that?
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.740]   Some, not many, like less than 20%.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.320]   But what they also have is this tremendous kind of diet, what we call dietary strain
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.660]   or control over their eating.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.000]   So they're, they are able to, to not overeat, even though they're thinking about food a
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.240]   lot.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.040]   So that's, that is, you know, that explains that unusual body of someone who's really
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.400]   more has still has those compulsive traits.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.780]   So why does this matter?
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.580]   Stress makes it really hard to eat well, because when you're stressed, you're craving the comfort
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.980]   food, the high fat, high sugar, high salt, depending on your temperament.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.460]   And that is, that means with repeated bouts of stress, you're just going to be gaining
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.500]   weight and particularly in the intra-abdominal area.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   That's what we've seen.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.340]   We've seen it cross-sectionally, we've seen it in rat studies, and mice studies, and now
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.100]   we've seen it in people and many, for about 10 years I studied this.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.560]   And the question was, is what's happening in people the same thing that's happening
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   in mice?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.500]   If you stress them out and you give them Oreos, the mice develop binge eating, they get really
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.900]   compulsive and they get this, you know, terrible metabolic health profile, metabolic syndrome,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.060]   where their, their round, you know, their, their belly fat basically expands like a cushion.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.680]   And that's because that's this really good immediate source of energy during stress.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.060]   So like, we're really well wired to, if our body thinks we're under chronic stress, we're
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.420]   going to store stress fat or abdominal fat, so we can just mobilize that in a second.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.540]   And then the second question we've asked is, can you reverse that with different interventions?
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.420]   Can you, can you block the compulsive eating?
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.260]   So I can, I can tell you what we found there.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.780]   But the opioid system that you mentioned is certainly involved.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.420]   And in studies with people, lean people and people with obesity, my colleague, Rajita
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.860]   Sinhat-Yale, it's basically found that when you stress them out, people with obesity are
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.020]   having a different reward response.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.180]   And they're having, they're, the more insulin resistant they are, the more their reward
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.700]   center lights up during stress.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.940]   And what's causal there?
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.940]   Like what's the chicken?
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.940]   What's the egg?
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.540]   So, because I can imagine these were people that at one time were not obese, who got stressed.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:12.820]   The opioid system reacted in a particularly potent way to food and they were able to clamp
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.820]   their stress.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.940]   And so then they become binge eaters in the context of stress.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.340]   And that leads to insulin insensitivity.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.300]   I could also imagine that they were insulin insensitive, therefore they need to eat more
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:35.420]   in order to feel kind of an increase in satiety, as we know this now, based on brain and body
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.420]   mechanisms.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.820]   And then that set off a cascade of things leading to obesity.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.340]   Not that it necessarily matters, but what's causal?
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.340]   Do we know if it's--
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.340]   Oh, I think it really does matter.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:54.260]   I think there's been a mistake of kind of confounding all obesity with food addiction
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.820]   and metabolic disease, and it's completely heterogeneous.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.820]   So I think it's the developmental path that you're describing, which is that there's a
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:08.320]   tendency toward having a bigger reward response and hunger during stress.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.100]   So it becomes a way of coping, a lifestyle, and that is a pathway toward obesity.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:20.540]   And so some obese people have a dysregulated stress response, but not all of them.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.380]   I mean, it really is a certain type of person.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.540]   So that's why we target people with cravings in all of our intervention studies now.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.900]   We want to know who has more of the compulsive eating type, because they need a different
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.340]   set of skills to cope with stress and to lose weight, if that's their goal.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.140]   There's a drug, I'm sure you're familiar with, naltrexone, which can block the opioid receptor.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.340]   It's used to block the opioid receptor in the context of different types of addiction.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.140]   Have people tried to use naltrexone in the context of binge eating, and does it help
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.500]   people lose weight?
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:01.620]   Because it presumably reduces some of the rewarding properties of food?
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.820]   That's one of the very few drug combinations that has been used for binge eating.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.200]   So it was a combination of naltrexone and Welbutrin.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.020]   And I'm not sure at this moment how much that's favored for binge eating, but certainly the
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.860]   early trials showed that it really does damp down on the compulsive eating.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.860]   Interesting.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.500]   There's a commonly prescribed kit of drugs now for obesity.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.420]   I know there's a lot of excitement nowadays about these semaglutide analogs, because they
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.780]   do seem very effective in blocking hunger, especially in type 2 diabetics.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.940]   I don't know if you're familiar, but there's all the rage, mostly because people saw the
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.300]   before and after photos of Elon, he had a shirt off on a boat and there were some not
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.100]   so nice comments made about him, and then sometime later he was quite a bit lighter
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.700]   and he announced that he'd been taking one of these semaglutide agonists.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.780]   I really hope that we come up with safe and effective drugs.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:02.700]   And one thing to think about is that the challenge that we all have, particularly if we're prone
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.100]   to obesity, is the toxic food environment, and particularly the refined sugar.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.920]   And regardless of what we're on, metformin or one of these drugs, we override it with
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   our diet.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.740]   And really, the improved nutrition is the only way to solve it as a public health problem.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.620]   I mean, the drug companies are saying everyone should be, everyone with a certain BMI should
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.860]   be on one of these new drugs, and it's just rubbish, and it's not going to lead to long-term
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.860]   health.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.340]   Well, I know you have a colleague there at UCSF, Dr. Robert Lustig, who's been talking
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.580]   about sugars and hidden sugars for years and the problems with that.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.500]   And we don't want to demonize sugar as the only cause of the obesity epidemic, but it's
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   certainly one of them.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.900]   At least that's my belief, according to the data.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.900]   Yes.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.580]   And Rob is the biggest proponent of helping people understand the big problem and the
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:57.380]   root is in the processed food and the sugar, and that the drugs don't touch that.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.220]   We override effects of any drugs with our diet.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:12.940]   And so it's been a losing battle, really, because of the force of big food and big pharma.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.260]   So let me go back to the compulsive eating.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.180]   So there are some clues about how to break that cycle.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:27.780]   So one is in our weight loss trials or our healthy, mindful eating trials, we find that
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.980]   mindful eating is not going to cause a lot of weight loss, period.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.260]   And if the people who benefit most from learning this kind of calm self-regulation where you
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:42.540]   check in with your hunger, you slow down, you increase your awareness of your body,
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:51.740]   so interoceptive awareness, that type of skill is really critical for people with compulsive
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.740]   eating.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.740]   And so in our trials, we find that people with compulsive eating, if they get randomized
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:03.060]   to the mindful eating, they do better in terms of their insulin resistance and their glucose
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.980]   and their long-term weight loss.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.700]   So that's one good clue.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:12.220]   Another is the positive stress pathway looks important for breaking the compulsive eating
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   cycle.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:20.060]   So high-intensity interval training or maybe some of these other ways that we've been talking
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.900]   about to increase the bodily stress in these short-term ways to metabolize stress in our
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.980]   body can help with the cravings.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.020]   So what would that look like in the context of – let's say somebody has the opposite
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   phenotype to me.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.560]   They get stressed and they find themselves reaching for snack food or that they simply
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.020]   can't reach satiety.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.380]   They just want to eat and eat and eat.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.100]   What are some of the – aside from naltrexone and wellbutrin and some of these prescription
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.620]   approaches, because I always say while I value – certainly value prescription drugs in
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.740]   certain contexts, I always feel like behavior should come first, do's and don'ts, then
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.300]   nutrition, then supplementation, and then if and only if it's still needed, prescription
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   drugs.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.700]   But that's just my bias based on my observations.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.700]   Pretty reasonable.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.460]   I like to think so.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.820]   It also is a – it starts at a zero-cost endeavor.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:14.820]   I mean behaviors require time, but it certainly includes everybody, not just those that have
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.340]   insurance or that live in a particular region of the U.S. or the world.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.140]   So anyway, that's my bias and at least for the time being, I'm sticking with it.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.820]   It's the basis of a lot of what we talk about on this podcast.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:33.000]   But nonetheless, if somebody is finding themselves in that category of binge eating or heading
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.680]   towards binge eating or using food to comfort or alleviate stress, how should they intervene
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.540]   in their own thoughts and behavior?
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.540]   We talked about the bins, top-down strategies, changing the body, changing the scene.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.540]   We need all of those.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:55.100]   I mean the compulsive drive to eat is one of our strongest impulses if we've developed
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.100]   that pathway.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:03.980]   And so we train people, for example, in mindful awareness of separating out emotions from
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   hunger.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.300]   So they get really wrapped up together.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.140]   So just labeling how you're feeling, labeling your hunger from one to ten, and figuring
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.300]   out am I really hungry or is it boredom.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.300]   That helps people.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.740]   And if you do that check-in right before you eat, that helps the most.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.420]   So that's the top-down mindful check-in.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:29.020]   The other thing we help people do is like ride the craving, surf the urge.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:36.300]   So we deal a lot with soda drinkers and it is addictive and there is nothing worse than
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.680]   drinking sugar soda for our body.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:47.700]   So we help people by having them watch their craving pass and knowing that it's a matter
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.420]   of time that they can surf the urge without jumping to consuming.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.460]   And so that practice helps some people, especially with practice.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:02.540]   The push-ups, the taking a walk, the changing the scene, getting away from food is always
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.340]   going to be a huge strong strategy if you can get yourself away from it.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.020]   The problem is, as you know, is that the cravings get you to the buffet.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.540]   They drive you to the soda, etc.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.060]   And so just creating safe environments both at home and in the workplace where you don't
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.820]   have soda is really important.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.820]   So we tried that at UCSF.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:29.860]   My colleagues and I, including Rob Lustig, the anti-sugar doctor, we just saw the absurdity
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.380]   of being a medical center.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.300]   People come with these chronic diseases and what are they served in a cafeteria or even
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.420]   at their bedside?
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.420]   Sugared Coke.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.420]   In the hospital.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.420]   In the hospital.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:49.260]   And so my colleague, Laura Schmidt, who's partly responsible for the soda tax, she rallied
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:55.460]   all the – we went top down to administration but bottom up to vendors, got rid of all the
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.340]   soda in all of our hospitals and campuses.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.640]   And we found two things.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:07.600]   Number one, people who were heavy drinkers lost weight in the most important place, their
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   waist.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   Heavy soda drinkers?
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.200]   So when we took it out of the workplace, they actually – their health improved.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:23.040]   And number two, those with compulsive eating, they score high on our little scale for reward
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.400]   based drive.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.160]   It didn't help them.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.600]   So then we randomized half of them to get some extra boost.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.180]   We call it motivational interviewing where we're really supporting them more and helping
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:41.000]   them think of goals like being with their grandchildren, not getting diabetes, and that
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.800]   little bit of support helped them tremendously.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.600]   And so now we're trying to roll that out in a big controlled trial.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.440]   But at least 100 hospitals have adopted the stop selling sugary drinks because people
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.720]   don't want to be sick but they can't help it if they have the reward drive and if they
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.240]   have the compulsivity and it's right there at work.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.880]   We're just working against health.
