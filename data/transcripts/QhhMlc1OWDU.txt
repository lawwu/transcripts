[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.180]   I think we're actually live.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.160]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound, where we just did 10 minutes of a show for no one,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.200]   because technology wasn't working.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.920]   I think we're back now.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.920]   All right.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.400]   Yeah, I think it's working now.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400]   I think it's working now.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   All right.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   Welcome back, everyone.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.680]   And welcome back, Duncan, from a trip to Germany.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.040]   Yeah, I'm having deja vu.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.160]   I feel like we already did this.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   Yeah, it's like we already talked about it.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160]   All right.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160]   Yeah, thanks, everyone, for coming out.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160]   Good to be back.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.320]   I already have been chatting about this now, but, yeah, got to drive on the Audubon.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320]   Had a lot of fun.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   Drove a M-series BMW.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320]   Hit, like, 118 miles an hour.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.120]   Happy to be back on the show with Ben there.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600]   I was jealous last week seeing you on with Bill, so.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.840]   Did you get to watch from Germany?
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.200]   Yeah, I watched some of it.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   Okay.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.200]   All right.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200]   Welcome back, everyone.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.680]   This week on The Compound is brought to you by Bird Dogs.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.720]   John, go ahead and throw up our Bird Dog picture from Future Proof a few weeks ago.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.840]   We're all wearing Bird Dogs here besides Nicole.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.040]   You can see John and Duncan have kind of the plain color ones, which is just fine.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240]   Michael has more of the camo look, and I have more loud ones.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440]   This is what I like about Bird Dogs is that they're not afraid to go a little crazy with
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440]   the designs.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.440]   And I like these ones.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.020]   I got a lot of compliments on them.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.900]   I wore them in this baiting suit.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.020]   Very comfortable.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.020]   Bird Dogs are great.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.960]   The funny thing is, I guess I can thank climate change, but it's been like 80s here through
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080]   October and I've still been wearing my Bird Dog shorts.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.640]   I thought I'd have to change over to ... I mean, before the world comes to an end, I
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.080]   think we're going to be able to enjoy some nice weather in Michigan.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.800]   The great news is with Bird Dogs, go to birddogs.com/atc for Ask The Compound, and we're still giving
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.320]   away this white Bird Dogs Dad Tech hat.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.280]   Again, just birddogs.com/atc or enter "ATC" in the promo code.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.680]   You're never going to want to take those Bird Dogs off, trust me.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   I wear a lot of them.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.160]   My wife asked the other day, "Why do you have so many of these?"
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.040]   And I said, "Because they're comfortable and I love them.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   Leave me alone."
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   All right.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040]   And they're our beloved sponsor.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   Yes.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   Okay.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.120]   Thanks to everyone in the live chat for sticking around.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.040]   You missed a live show with Duncan and I just for the two of us for 10 minutes.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   You had a really good answer to that first question too, so yeah, we'll do it again.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680]   I got a lot of practice.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.680]   Let's run it back.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   We'll do it live.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   Okay.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.120]   Let's do it live though, because it feels disingenuous to do it more than once because
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.240]   you feel like you're not giving it your all.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.880]   I could never be an actor and do multiple takes.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.080]   I would have to be in only Clint Eastwood movies because he only does one take, right?
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   That's it.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   He's famous for that.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080]   I know.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   It feels weird.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   It feels weird.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080]   Also in the chat, the chat was going great.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   Everyone's talking.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.080]   I thought we were live.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.080]   I had no idea.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   They were conversing like nothing was wrong.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   All right.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   Let's do it.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   All right.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   Here we go.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.680]   First today, we have a question from Kevin that I feel extra good about reading now.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.800]   Kevin writes, "I've always wanted to do my own Not to Brag, so here it goes.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.520]   I'm 33 and have $300,000 spread between a Roth IRA, Roth 401k, and a taxable account,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.240]   all in VTI and VOO.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.160]   I own my home and have $75,000 cash.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.720]   I don't really understand bonds other than when rates go up, they go down in price and
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.280]   vice versa.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.600]   TLT, the 20-year bond ETF, has crashed since rates started going up in 2022.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.640]   Assuming we're near the end of the rate increase cycle, even if rates stay higher for longer,
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.560]   why shouldn't I put $50,000 in TLT?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.520]   If I hold it for a few years, it stands to reason that rates will be cut when inflation
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.200]   concerns are behind us or the Fed has to respond to a true recession.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.080]   How high can rates actually go from here?"
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.920]   And then they say, "This just doesn't seem that risky long-term."
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.360]   All right.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.000]   Famous last words from Kevin here.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.960]   Nice job on the Not to Brag.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.040]   Let's look at the chart, John.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.560]   Long-term bonds have crashed in a big way.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.640]   This is TLT, the 20- to 30-year Treasury bond ETF.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.220]   It's down over 46%.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.240]   This includes income, which hasn't been very much in the past few years, by the way.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.360]   If you include inflation on here, we're talking about like a 60% crash, 60% plus in about
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.540]   three years, which is kind of crazy because the period from like 1950 to 1981, long-term
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.360]   bonds were down, I think, 70% on a real basis, inflation-adjusted basis.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   That took 30 years.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.440]   We've done what happened in 30 years in about three years.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.720]   And if you look at this chart, I counted, I think, seven separate corrections of 10%
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.200]   or worse since the inception of this fund in the early 2000s, and interest rates were
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.520]   falling for most of that period.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   So long-term bonds are no joke in terms of volatility.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.200]   Obviously, the crash right now is another way of saying that yields have gone up.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.840]   And so if we look at the characteristics of this fund, John put that on, this is the characteristics
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   of TLT.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.820]   I highlighted two variables here.
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.640]   One is average yield maturity, which is now over 5%, which seemed unfathomable, I don't
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.200]   know, 24 months ago that you'd go from 1% to 5%, which is kind of crazy that you can
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.600]   lock that in.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   The other one is effective duration.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   So Kevin is right.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.080]   If bond yields rise, prices fall.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.040]   If bond yields fall, prices rise.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.640]   So what duration tells us is that relationship between interest rates and bond prices.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.480]   So with an effective duration of 16.3 years, what this would tell us is basically for every
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.260]   1% move in this bond, rates up or down, it's going to move 16%, 16.3% or so in price.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.660]   Not exactly precise, but pretty close.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.120]   So rates fall 1%, you're up 16% plus whatever yield you're getting, which is pretty good,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   right?
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.400]   So rates fall 1%, we're talking about like a 20 some percent gain.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.200]   Now, if rates were to rise 1%, you're down 16%, right?
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.920]   So I guess it is worth pointing out that the maturity for this is a long time.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.960]   That's part of the reason the duration moves so much.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.000]   But here's what I say.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.200]   This seems like a nice setup for bonds.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.920]   Rates have come up a ton off of zero to five.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.040]   If we go into recession or the Fed cuts rates or economic growth slows or inflation keeps
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.320]   coming down, you would expect rates to fall.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.440]   The timing is the thing that can bite you on this one, though.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.120]   What if, I don't know, what if economic growth keeps coming in hot or people decide the world
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.020]   is burning and I'm selling treasuries because government debt is spilling out of control
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.520]   and rates go to seven before they drop back down to three, right?
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.320]   Can you sit through a 35% drawdown in the meantime?
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   You can just get smashed.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   And what happens when yields do drop?
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.360]   Do you sell out after they hit 4% or wait until they get three?
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.000]   What's your out on this?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.580]   That's the difference between a trade and an investment, right?
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.000]   TLT rates kind of stay where they are, they stay in a range, but TLT is very volatile
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   in the meantime.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.720]   So I just think, I understand the thinking behind the trade.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.420]   I just don't think it's as easy as it sounds.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.580]   So one of my favorite books, Winning the Loser's Game by Charlie Ellis, who is one of my favorite
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.700]   communicators in all of finance, he had this analogy that investors, there's a difference
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.720]   between pros and amateurs, and he used tennis as an example.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.300]   So there was a study done that showed most tennis players, right?
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.940]   They strike the ball down the line, they have this laser-like precision, and there's these
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.180]   long rallies, and finally someone hits it in, or there's an unforced error.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.500]   But most of the time, professional tennis players don't make errors.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.020]   And in fact, he said that it's been estimated 80% of the time, they hit winners, the professionals.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.080]   But amateur tennis players, they're double faulting it into the net, they're hitting
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.900]   it over, they're hitting it across the line, 80% of the time, when they lose a point, it's
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.240]   because of an unforced error, they hit out of bounds, or they made a mistake.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.980]   And that's the idea, is that minimizing mistakes is just as important as hitting winners in
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.980]   investing, especially for people who aren't professionals, aren't hedge fund managers.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.960]   So the point is, how do you avoid beating yourself as an investor?
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.020]   Personally, I like to have rules in place to guide my actions.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.320]   I try to minimize mistakes by avoiding market timing, I don't like to make short-term bets
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.660]   on the market and try to predict what's going to happen in the short-term, and then I just
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.180]   don't like to have investments in my portfolio that don't fit my personality or investing
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.180]   style.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.180]   And one of those is, I've never been a fan of owning long-term treasuries.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.500]   I've looked at the historical data.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.300]   They had a wonderful run from 1980 to 2020, as rates were falling, and they were one of
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.580]   the better investments.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   You got almost the same return as you did in the stock market, with way less volatility.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.040]   It's been a wonderful bond bull market.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.860]   And if we see double-digit yields again, like we had in the '80s, I'd be happy to take part
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.980]   in those again.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.580]   I just don't think it's worth the volatility.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.260]   I'd rather be paid for volatility, where it makes sense, and that's in the stock market,
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.900]   as opposed to the bond market, where I think, for me, that's keep it safe, have some income.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.820]   And you can also earn higher yields in intermediate-term bonds right now, and I'd have to try to nail
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.640]   the trade of directions of interest rates.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.340]   So if we look at the historical returns for long-term bonds, the case becomes far less
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.340]   compelling.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.940]   So this is annual returns going back to 1926.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.420]   So this includes the bond bull market.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:33.980]   Even with the bond bull market from 1980 to 2020, annual returns for long-term government
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.620]   bonds are 5% per year.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.820]   For 5-year treasuries, far less duration risk, far less volatility and drawdown risk.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.420]   It's 4.8% annually.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.740]   You get double the volatility in long-term bonds in basically the same returns.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.860]   So John, if we look at the next one that shows the drawdown profile, this is just since the
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.500]   mid-2000s, early 2000s, you get way bigger drawdowns in long-term treasuries than you
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.940]   get in these 3- to 7-year treasuries, which is essentially 5 years.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.900]   So I just don't think it's worth it for that volatility risk for me.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.300]   Now, I'm not going to try to talk you out of a trade if you're going to go into it with
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   eyes wide open.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.240]   It's just, it's entirely possible long-term bonds are setting up for a great trade here.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.540]   The Fed pushes too hard, we go into recession, whatever it is, but I think you really have
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.180]   to nail the timing for a trade like this to work.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.460]   I guess the good news is that you don't have to participate in every trade or invest in
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.660]   opportunities because it seems so juicy.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.020]   What's the point of this money in the first place?
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.620]   I'm taking 50 grand and I'm going to put it out here just to make, what's your end game
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.660]   for the investment, I guess?
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.860]   What's your time horizon and risk profile?
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.540]   Not just, is there a great opportunity?
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.460]   You could have a great investment opportunity, but if it doesn't fit your personality or
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.860]   your investment plan, I don't know, I think it's tempting fate to try to time something
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.120]   like this.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.000]   It opens you up to more mistakes and unnecessary risks than you probably think.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.460]   I have a couple of follow-ups here.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.620]   Kevin says, "How high can rates actually go?"
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.180]   What do you think?
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.180]   What's the answer to that?
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.180]   The TLDR to that?
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.780]   I mean, the thing is, if nominal growth is going to be 5% or 6%, 5% or 6% yields in 30-year
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.100]   bonds are not out of the ordinary.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.100]   It really depends on ... We had this period in the '80s and '90s where rates were much
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.940]   higher than inflation or growth.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.140]   Obviously, the difference then is that they're coming down and now they're going up.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.220]   It feels a lot worse.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.220]   I don't know.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.180]   I never say never in the markets.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.800]   I would have never expected yields to go from 1% to 5% so fast, but could the economy continue
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.460]   to be strong and the government spends a lot of money still and we get 6% nominal growth
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.460]   with 3% inflation?
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.700]   Then, I don't know, could rates stay at 5% or 6% for a while?
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.700]   It's possible.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.020]   I guess you never throw these things out, I guess.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.780]   Do you think that people should stop calling bonds the safe part of your portfolio?
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.820]   People like me, non-finance pros, people have always said, "You ask 9 out of 10 people what's
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.980]   the point of bonds in a portfolio, they're going to say, 'Oh, that's the safe part of
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.440]   your portfolio.'"
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.560]   After this recent chaos in the bond market, does that really need to be restated or rethought?
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.080]   It depends what kind of bonds we're talking about.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.840]   I think that's what people have realized is that, "Oh, wait, yeah, long-term bonds are
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.560]   great when you have a rush to safety or a recession and yields are falling, but when
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.220]   yields rise, yeah, these are not safe because the duration is 30 years.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   The maturity is 30 years.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.420]   The duration is 16 years or whatever.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.820]   That's a long time.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.060]   So, short-term bonds, yeah, they're still pretty safe.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.660]   I think anything less than one to two years is still pretty darn safe in terms of volatility
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.140]   and losing money, but for longer duration assets, yeah, there is a risk there of inflation
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.860]   and higher interest rates.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.460]   But no, certain types of bonds and cash, and I think that's the thing people have to realize
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.340]   that maybe you just have to be a little more conservative and not go so far out on the
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.340]   risk curve.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.340]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.100]   I think a lot of young people bought TLT back a couple years ago and were like, "Oh, that's
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.700]   my responsible money.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.540]   The rest of it I'm putting in all these risky stocks," and then they're like, "Wait, I got
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.540]   cut in half.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.540]   It's a safe part of my portfolio."
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.540]   Yeah, when you see how volatile this stuff, and again, I was saying this before we had
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:11.660]   a huge crash that these bonds are too volatile for me, so we should mention that the doc
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.780]   this week for questions was bonds, bonds, bonds, yield, yield, yield.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:19.040]   People are really into this stuff right now and really curious about it, which makes sense
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.820]   because I think it's more exciting and interesting than the stock market right now.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.820]   That's for sure.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.820]   Okay.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.820]   Speaking of which, here's another one.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.820]   Yep.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.340]   Up next, another bond question.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.740]   I'm a married 30-year-old who is just a normal IT guy.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.780]   I max out my 401(k) and Roth 401(k), but I like to invest in things that reward me on
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.780]   the other side.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.420]   I use betterment to do this.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.420]   For example, I allocate money every week to hopefully buy a vacation home in five to seven
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.420]   years.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.260]   I'm interested in your bond discussion from Animal Spirits as my whole life has been stocks,
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.620]   stocks, stocks to this point.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.580]   I'm not sure how to buy bonds or if I should.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.820]   Could I buy bonds to achieve yield on my money for goals that have different timelines?
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   I love the idea of regularly saving like this, like the whole idea of like not just I'm going
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.700]   to invest for 40 years down the line.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.860]   I think that's one of the reasons young people have a hard time saving for retirement in
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860]   the first place.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.660]   It's like I'm going to let future me worry about that, not present me, so I love the
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.180]   idea of saving for a goal like this for five to seven years.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.180]   I think from experience, I can say you're not going to regret saving for a purchase
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.180]   like this.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.020]   The thing is, you have options galore when it comes to yield these days.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.380]   We talked a lot about Series I savings bonds in the past.
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.260]   Throw those out the window now.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.180]   Yields are like 4.3%.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.180]   You can do a lot better.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.140]   I think a lot of people, too, who put their money into these Series I savings bonds are
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.540]   taking them out now and paying a yield penalty, so it probably wasn't even worth it to begin
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.380]   with, especially when you consider the website and stuff.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.140]   I made it 13 months with mine.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.140]   Okay.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.980]   So you paid a little penalty.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.060]   You could also do T-bills, which are still paying 5.5% or so, or an online savings account
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.060]   like Marcus.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.500]   Mine's 4.4%, which still feels low considering the yield environment.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.780]   I'm waiting for a bump from them again.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.660]   However, this person has a defined time horizon of five to seven years.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.540]   These short-term solutions come with a reinvestment risk.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.420]   T-bills and online savings account rates could fall in the short end, and then you're stuck
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.860]   missing out on today's current high yields.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   You want to lock them in.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.620]   You actually can lock in higher rates, which is like an asset liability match.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.900]   I want to invest for five years, so I checked bank rate today, and I'm seeing five years
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.900]   CDs for like 4.5%.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.980]   So you can lock them in for five years, get 4.5%.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.140]   Not a lot of liquidity in CDs.
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.580]   You can take them out early, and again, like iBonds, you'll have to pay a penalty.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.020]   But that's not a bad case.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.580]   Five-year Treasuries, as of this morning when I checked, are yielding 4.7%.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.100]   Seven-year Treasuries are about the same.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.300]   You could get a three-year Treasury for like 4.9%.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.260]   I think if you really wanted to lock in and match it up, the five-year probably makes
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.260]   the most sense.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.700]   You could buy these through a broker, or Treasury Direct is pretty simple.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.780]   I've never personally purchased individual bonds, just because I think it's easier to
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.180]   buy ETFs.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.180]   It's less work.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.220]   You don't have to think about it as much.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.340]   You could buy the three- to seven-year ETF we talked about in the last question.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.900]   It yields around 4.9% yield to maturity.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.620]   Any total bond market index fund right now that tracks the aggregate is like 5.5% to
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.220]   5.6% average yield to maturity.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.220]   That's pretty good.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.180]   The one problem here is that these are constant maturity funds.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.780]   So a three- to seven-year Treasury ETF is going to stay three to seven years.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   So as you approach your goal and get closer, your risk and duration is a little further
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   out.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   So it's away from your desired goal.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.740]   So I think the good news with a fund like this is rates can go higher, which you'd
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.660]   see that price decline, but then you'd also immediately reinvest into those higher rates
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.100]   as those bonds come off.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.660]   This is why some people prefer individual bonds.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.660]   The thing is, there are now ETFs that you can buy that act like individual bonds.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.540]   So iShares has an item called iBonds, which sounds like something Apple created.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.740]   But you can actually pick the maturity of the bond line.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.260]   They actually have a thing where you can set up a bond ladder.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.740]   So it matures every year, every 24 months, or every 36 months or whatever.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.500]   And you can line it up with, I'm going to buy this vacation home five years from now,
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.020]   so I'm going to buy the bond that matures in five years, or seven years and it matures
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.100]   in seven.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.140]   And so you could do that, or you could build a ladder and buy them as you are saving on
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.140]   a weekly basis.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.660]   You can slowly but surely build it up.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.860]   So if you just search iBond ladders, it's a pretty cool little tool and website that
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.100]   they have.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.500]   I don't really think you can go wrong in today's yield environment, whatever you choose.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.820]   But if you wanted to lock it in, that's probably the thing, so you don't have to worry about
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.340]   short-term rates falling if there is a recession or the Fed cuts or whatever.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.940]   I just think you have to understand the tradeoffs with options like CDs and short-term bonds
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.580]   and T-bills and then longer-term bonds.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.100]   But you have options galore these days that you didn't have in the past.
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.100]   I didn't know about this.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.100]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.100]   That's interesting.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.740]   I didn't realize they'd be able to do stuff like that in the mechanics of an ETF.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.820]   Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.820]   So I think they have one.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.980]   I don't know if it's every six months or every 12 months, but you can sort of pick the end
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.260]   date and invest in it as you get close.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.780]   So there's one that's probably like, I don't know, 3.75 years or something right now, whatever.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.340]   So it's a pretty cool option if you know the end date of your goal where you have to spend
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.340]   it.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.300]   That's like matching your assets and your liabilities.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.420]   Since we have bonds on the brain today, is it true that you should never own bonds in
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.100]   a taxable account?
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.740]   No, because if you need to spend the money, then you don't want to put them in a tax-deferred
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.740]   account.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.300]   So, I mean, you're paying income on those bonds, of course.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.100]   Yeah, I guess you could think of munis as well if you want to have the taxes not take
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.060]   as big of a bite out, but the yield kind of is taken into account there.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.700]   But no, if you want to spend the money, then you don't have to put it in taxable.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.700]   Right.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.700]   Okay.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   That's just another thing that I've heard people say before is like, oh, yeah, don't
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.860]   hold them in a taxable account.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.860]   Another bond one.
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.740]   And this next one is one I think we've never gotten before.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.100]   So this is an interesting one.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.100]   Yep.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.100]   Okay.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.480]   So this one is from Paul.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.780]   You guys have talked about the statistical facts and the human factors of what to do
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.980]   with a lump sum if the ultimate goal is to get into the stock market.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   But what about bonds?
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.100]   I have about $30,000 to put towards a house and a car down payment that I won't use until
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.340]   spring or summer of 2026.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.500]   If I plan to use a few assorted bond ETFs, would I be better off putting it all in ASAP
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.140]   or dollar count cost averaging?
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.140]   All right.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.020]   Let's bring our resident DCA expert in here.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.580]   You hear dollar count cost averaging and lump sum and you immediately know.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.580]   That's true.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.460]   Nick Majulie, who writes our wonderful blog of dollars and data, the book Just Keep Buying.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.460]   Hey, Nick.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.780]   I don't think you've even ever written about this.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   Have you, Nick?
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.300]   You think you've done a piece about diversified portfolios with lump sum or dollar cost averaging.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.020]   Have you looked into bonds before?
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.060]   I did this for like basically every asset class.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.020]   I did it for Bitcoin, gold, bonds, and basically across the board, like going earlier generates
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.380]   a higher total return.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.500]   I mean, this has been true across every asset class.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.380]   I mean, you assume-- I mean, for risk assets, at least, you assume they're going up over
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.380]   time.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.900]   If that's the whole reason you're investing, why would you be putting money in something
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900]   you expect to go down?
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.900]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.260]   So if you're expecting something to go up over time, the sooner you do it, on average,
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.260]   you tend to outperform.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.980]   It's about 80% of the time, et cetera.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.700]   Probably even more so with bonds, though, right?
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.940]   So I looked at this before, and the S&P over the last 100 years is up like 300 every four
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.100]   years on average.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.260]   I think I found for five-year treasuries, it's like 88% of all calendar years are positive,
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.460]   which makes sense, because bonds don't go down as much, because they don't go up as
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.460]   high as stocks.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.180]   And you're just clipping the yield and income.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.540]   So most of the time, bonds are up in a given year.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.060]   So it would make sense that you wouldn't want to overthink this, and you just want to put
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.060]   the money into that bond and start earning the income.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.780]   I think in this particular question-- let's say I was in this person's shoes.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.060]   The only thing I'm actually slightly worried about, in just the smallest way, is we know
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.180]   the debt ceiling is good through, I think, January 2025.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.140]   And this guy's talking about, I'm just going to lock my money up till, whatever, spring
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.460]   2026.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.620]   In the event that the US actually defaults and there's madness, that's the only real
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.220]   risk I see of this strategy.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.220]   Outside of that--
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.220]   Do you want to make a call, Nick?
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.220]   No.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.220]   I'm not making a call.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.220]   I'm just saying--
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.220]   Well, can't we--
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.220]   I'm only buying treasury bills--
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.220]   --in the next 45 days.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.220]   --through-- yeah.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   I'm only buying T-bills through next December.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.140]   I mean, there aren't any that are for next December yet, because they're only one year.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.980]   But once my T-bills roll over this December, I'm buying them through next December and
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.860]   then playing a wait-and-see game, because after that, I have no clue what's going to
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.860]   happen.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.900]   Well, the other thing is, in the last question, I talked about the options you have now for
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.900]   yield.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.860]   If you're really worried about something like that, you could diversify your yield sources,
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.860]   right?
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.860]   I have some in an online savings account.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.860]   I have some in T-bills.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.420]   I have some in a bond ETF, or whatever it is, that is corporates or munis or something
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   else.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.580]   So I think you can, if that's really a worry, that the money's not going to be there for
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.580]   a T-bill.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.020]   And hopefully, if that ever really did happen, and I don't know, maybe--
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.580]   I think we have bigger problems on our hands, honestly, if the US defaults.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.580]   But it's--
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.580]   And you'd--
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.580]   I would put it in now.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.580]   Here's the thing.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.580]   Here's the worry about putting it in now.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.580]   You're going to see rates go up more.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.300]   Now your bond is-- you have a crappy bond.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.900]   There's better bonds you can buy, so the price of your bond goes down.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.100]   But that's OK, because you can sell that crappy bond and reinvest it at the higher rate.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.700]   So you're still going to get the same return.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.820]   So if you have a bond that's paying 5%, you're going to get 5%, even if you sell early.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.580]   But you just have to reinvest that money, right?
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.260]   So bonds are all mathematically, I would say, perfect in that way, that you're going to
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.260]   get--
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.860]   Whatever you buy, you're going to get that return if you just wait through the end of
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.860]   it, right?
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.860]   You don't want to wait for that.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860]   That's it.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.860]   You're going to deal with that volatility in the interim.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.660]   And especially with a shorter-term goal like this, I would think DCA would be your enemy
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.460]   as opposed to your friend.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.940]   Because unless you invest in something that's really risky and it crashes in the short term,
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940]   your goal is not that far.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.980]   So you shouldn't be taking that much risk anyway.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.980]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.020]   You don't DCA bonds.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.340]   I could see the arguments for stocks and risk assets, and we can get into that.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.620]   But for bonds, no.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.620]   There's no need for that.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.620]   OK.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   All right.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.620]   Let's do another one.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.620]   All right.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.620]   Thank you.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.940]   I was looking at my personal balance sheet the other day and thinking about whether my
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.620]   personal leverage ratio, total debt to net worth, is at an appropriate level.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:40.100]   To clarify, I'm not just referring to leverage in an investment portfolio, but overall leverage,
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.700]   mortgage debt, auto loans, student debt, margin loans, et cetera.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.700]   In the financial planning world, is this ratio something you look at with clients?
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.300]   And if so, would you consider a healthy range?
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:58.580]   For context, my leverage ratio is currently about 0.6 to 1, and my only debt is my mortgage.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.580]   Is this too low?
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.420]   Do I have room to lever up a little more?
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.580]   I've never actually thought about this before.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.580]   Same.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.300]   So they asked about how it works in the financial planning context.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   I think in the financial planning world, you look at income to debt, maybe, in terms of
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.100]   how much you're spending out of your portfolio, how much money you're making, and it's like,
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.420]   how much do you bring in and then how much do you spend?
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.100]   And your debt service ratio or your debt payments fall into that second category, and it's just
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.620]   does your income, is your income big enough to cover your debt payments?
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.140]   That's the only thing I'd be worried about, not what is your debt to your assets or net
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.140]   worth or whatever.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.140]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:37.620]   This feels like a good time to say shout out to all my fellow student loan people making
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.620]   payments again.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.620]   So.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.900]   I mean, the good news is you're paying that off and it'd be going down.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.440]   But John, throw up the chart here that shows U.S. household debt service as a percentage
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   of disposable income.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.980]   The average since, I don't know, the 80s is like 11 percent.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.980]   It's much lower than that now.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.860]   It's a little below 10 percent.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.380]   So I don't know, Nick, have you ever looked into this?
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.020]   Like what what is a reasonable ratio?
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.460]   So I haven't, but I agree with it's all about the income, right?
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.900]   You're looking because what is debt that you have to make payments on, right?
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.900]   You make payments on your debt.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.420]   And the question is, like, the risk you run into is not being able to make payments and
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.820]   defaulting and it hurts your credit score, all the nasty things that happen there.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.820]   Right.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.320]   So the real issue is like, I don't care about your debt ratio.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.880]   It's like you could have a debt ratio of 10 percent.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.200]   But if you have really high interest rate debt, that could be worse.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.320]   And you have a higher payment than someone who has 50 or 60 percent mortgage rate debt
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.080]   or debt, maybe say from a mortgage.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   It's a really low rate.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.120]   So you've got to it's the rate that matters and the size of the debt.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.840]   It's kind of there's multiple variables here that are moving together.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.360]   So I would say, like, I wouldn't focus on whether you should lever up more.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   It's like, think about how much risk you're taking now with like your debt payments relative
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.940]   to what your income is and look at that and what's the right ratio.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.640]   This is going to be different for every person.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   Are you single?
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   Do you have low liabilities?
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.200]   Do you have a family, a large family of take care of a lot of other liabilities like all
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.760]   those things affect how much risk you want to take.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.680]   So I'm generally not a fan of debt.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.840]   Of course, like I think there's like mortgage that's useful.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.840]   I think education that can be very useful if you can get if you can get into a job that
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.280]   ends up benefiting you.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.080]   But it's it's always case specific.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.320]   You have to look at it individually.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.480]   So I can't I will say generalize answer my my outlook on debt totally changed in the
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.240]   in the early 2020s.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.320]   I took it as much debt as it possibly could when rates were 3 percent or whatever.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.560]   And I think I'm glad I did.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.320]   But again, I had to think in terms of payments and there's this old budgetary rule that's
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.080]   like the 50 30 20 rule.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.920]   And it's like 50 percent of income should go into necessities, which is basically housing,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.280]   transportation, health care, that sort of stuff.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.840]   Other regular bills, 30 percent on wants and then 20 percent on savings or paying off debt
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   or whatever.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   So I think what is it?
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.680]   30 percent for housing is typically a pretty good rule of thumb.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   Like that's what you want to pay.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.440]   And I think you can think of that in terms of debt, too.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.340]   I would look at it more in terms of your budget as opposed to your net worth, because you're
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:57.600]   right, the high the high cost of debt right now has to be taken into account way more
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.760]   than the actual amount of the debt.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.760]   Exactly.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.240]   I agree in New York, I think housing is more like 80 percent of the budget, you know, you
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   don't need a car.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   So you're fine.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.280]   Yeah, that's that's how you make it make sense.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.360]   All right.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   Last question.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   All right.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.740]   Last but not least, we have a question from Stefan.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.280]   I've heard you discuss dollar cost averaging DCA is how we're going to abbreviate it.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.520]   The easy scenario to discuss is the 401k IDCA because I get paid and contribute monthly.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.680]   The more complex scenario deals with a self-directed IRA with an established balance where taxes
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.420]   and cost of transactions are not an issue.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:42.320]   If we take the current bear market and compare two situations or portfolios, Portfolio A
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.200]   has two hundred thousand dollars fully invested.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.320]   Portfolio B has two hundred thousand dollars with one hundred thousand invested and one
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.920]   hundred thousand in cash.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.760]   An advisor might tell Portfolio A to sit tight.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.140]   You can't time the market.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.240]   Safe advice.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.160]   An advisor might tell Portfolio B to start DCA-ing that one hundred thousand dollars
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.000]   over the next six months or year because you can't time the dip.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Safe advice again.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.900]   Here is the rub.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.320]   With one costless trade, Portfolio B could look exactly like Portfolio A, be fully invested
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.840]   and be told to sit out the market swoons.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.200]   With one costless trade, Portfolio A could go to 50% cash and look like Portfolio B and
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.920]   start to dollar cost average.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.880]   I've never heard of someone selling half their portfolio just to start dollar cost averaging
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.200]   it back in.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.760]   If that is the best financial advice, then why not go all cash and start dollar cost
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   averaging back in?
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.320]   I love this question because it feels like a logic puzzle and I'm pretty sure that it
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   might be a syllogism.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.880]   I remember that from college.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.120]   It is kind of like a dorm room discussion if you ever talked about markets when you
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.800]   were in college, I guess.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.320]   I think he's twisted his brain into a pretzel a little bit here overthinking this.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.560]   So the Charlie Munger rule number one of compounding is never interrupt it unnecessarily, right?
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.440]   And Nick, of course, your work has shown that dollar cost averaging works over the long
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.380]   term and is a pretty good strategy, but lump sum beats it.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.680]   So the point is you don't want to take a portfolio that's fully invested and sell out of it
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.080]   to dollar cost average because the market might do A, B or C over the next few months.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.280]   The point is to keep that money in and let it compound no matter what happens.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.480]   So I think he's overthinking it here.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.360]   You don't do dollar cost averaging because it's a better strategy.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.680]   You do it because you kind of have to or you have behavioral reasons for it.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.720]   I think the other thing here too is, yeah, the other thing to think about with regards
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.920]   to this is like, okay, it's not a costless trade.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.240]   I mean, it costs nothing because there's no transaction costs to move into like to go
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.160]   from 100% stock to 50/50 stock and cash.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.280]   But like with that same argument, why don't you just go 100% cash?
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.680]   Why don't you go and take out debt and lever?
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.360]   I mean, you could take this.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.120]   I mean, I don't think it's a costless trade in that sense.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.220]   You are making a pretty big statement about the future, right?
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:53.420]   When you go from 100% stock to 50% stock, 50% cash, you're basically market timing.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.420]   That's what you're doing, right?
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.360]   You're saying, hey, I think the market's going to go lower, right?
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   That's the only way.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.480]   DCA only outperforms or what I call averaging in.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.440]   So slowly putting your money into the market only outperforms in cases when the market's
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   dropping, right?
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:13.160]   So if you had 100K in cash and 100K in stock, I would say on average, the right thing to
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.560]   do across history is you put that 100K cash in right now because on average, the market's
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.240]   going to go up and 80% of years, you'd be right, right, versus putting it in every month
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.840]   over the next year, right?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.080]   However, the only time where that's not right, where that would have been the wrong move
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.400]   is when the market goes down.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.920]   So you're basically saying the market's going to keep crashing, and that's why I want to
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   DCA in.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.760]   But I'm saying, if you're going to do that, why even DC-- why not just wait until the
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   bottom?
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.800]   Because that's-- you're going to-- you already think the market's going to crash.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.440]   Why not predict the bottom or something else, right?
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.600]   So it's-- you can see how the logic breaks down pretty quickly once you make a little
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   bit of a sin.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   And then you start going beyond that.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.760]   And you can start kind of getting into the space where you're now in all cash.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.520]   And then all of a sudden, the market rips back upward, and you're not involved at all.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   And so I've seen this happen.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   We saw this happen during COVID.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520]   And so it's rough to see that.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   You get yourself in trouble.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.680]   And this is like, if I invert like Munger, your whole idea about spending the portfolio,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.200]   too, is you want to put the lump sum in if you can early, but then you want to spend
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   it slowly, like a dollar-cost average.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   So essentially what he's saying here is, you take a lump sum out of the portfolio.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.520]   And that's the faulty reasoning here, is you're taking it out at one time and putting it back
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   in slowly.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.920]   The time that you take it out could be the wrong move, too.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.280]   So I think, yes, you want to just-- if it's in there, you leave it in there, and you let
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.560]   the long-term of the market take care of it, and compound, and don't work against you,
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.240]   and overthinking it, and trying to dollar-cost average.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.300]   Most people do that, again, because they get the money, and they put in money out of their
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:38.200]   paychecks, or because they do it for behavioral reasons and don't-- but mathematically and
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.240]   logically, you'd want to put the money in right away if you can.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.320]   And if you're worried about it, then take a few months.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.840]   I mean, the difference between putting it all in now and putting it over three months
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.640]   is so miniscule, it doesn't really matter.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   It's like 2%.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.960]   It's like, OK, $100,000, $2,000, who cares?
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.840]   But now it's less risk you're taking, so you can sleep at night.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   That's fine.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.720]   But if you take a year, two years, five years, the longer you take to get invested, that's
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.120]   where you really start to see the pain.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.880]   It's the foregone money you would have had, right?
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.640]   So that's where I kind of recommend people, hey, if you're taking over a year, don't do
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   that.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.040]   If you want to take a few months, even six months, go ahead.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.280]   It's not going to really make a difference in your life.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   So--
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.280]   That's true.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.000]   Speaking on behalf of the dumb money, I would just say I've gotten myself into more trouble
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.360]   with dollar cost averaging over the years because I don't notice how much I'm down.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.240]   It's like I'm putting in a set amount into a certain stock, an individual stock, right?
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.480]   And I wake up one day, I'm down like 45% in a stock, whereas if I just put everything
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.680]   I wanted to put into that stock up front, I probably would have sold it when I was down
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   15%, 20%.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.160]   Oh, because you're averaging down and your cost basis is going down?
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.480]   Yeah, it doesn't feel as bad over time.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.000]   So I think that's another argument that I could potentially make for lump sum, kind of
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.320]   maybe saving-- it would have saved me some losses.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.000]   Well, you're talking individual stocks here.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   We're talking about the market.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Right, right.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   You're talking about the market.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I'm talking about individual stocks.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And Duncan, just a tip, Duncan.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.320]   I recommend buying the stocks that go up.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.320]   That usually helps.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   So--
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.640]   See, I love a good sale, you know?
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.120]   So you average all the way down and then you sell it at the bottom.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.120]   That's--
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   Right.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   That's your problem.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.120]   That's how you tax loss harvest, right?
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   All right.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   Just-- all right.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   Yeah, just buy a lotto ticket, Duncan.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.120]   That's my book.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.120]   Just keep tax loss harvesting.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120]   All right.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   Can only carry over for so long.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   All right.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   All right.
