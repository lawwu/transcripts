[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.100]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.220]   Today, we are discussing headaches.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640]   Headaches are something that everybody will suffer
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.620]   at some point in their lifetime.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.140]   Of course, some people suffer from headaches
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.740]   far more often than others.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.860]   And for many people,
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.480]   headaches can be incredibly debilitating,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.740]   limiting their ability to work, to socialize, to sleep,
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.640]   to exercise, essentially to live life
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.540]   in any kind of normal way.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.140]   As we'll soon discuss,
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.080]   there are many different kinds of headache.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.920]   We have migraine headaches, tension headaches,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.840]   cluster headaches.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.800]   Today, we'll review all the different types of headaches
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.880]   and what the underlying biology
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.480]   of each and every one of those types of headaches is,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.320]   as well as, fortunately,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.440]   the many excellent treatments that exist
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.000]   for the different types of headache.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.620]   In fact, what we'll soon discuss
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.960]   is that by understanding which type of headache you have
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.200]   and a little bit about the underlying biology
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.080]   of each different type of headache,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.440]   it becomes quite straightforward
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.260]   to select the best treatment options for you
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.160]   to, for instance, provide relief
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.820]   from frequent and recurring tension headaches,
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.480]   cluster headaches, even sinus headaches,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.180]   the sorts of headaches that are associated
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.200]   with sinus infections and colds
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.740]   where the sinuses get clogged up
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.000]   and you experience headache.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.360]   So while today's episode focuses on all aspects
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.040]   and types of headaches,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.440]   it will have tremendous relevance for everybody.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.240]   So for those of you that experience headache
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640]   every once in a while,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.980]   or only when you're sick or have a sinus headache,
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.160]   or for those of you that suffer from debilitating migraines,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.940]   today's conversation actually has a bit of optimism
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.000]   woven into it, meaning there are excellent treatments
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900]   for each and every one of the different types of headaches.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.440]   And I was quite impressed and excited to learn
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.140]   when researching this episode
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.140]   that the treatments for headache range from, of course,
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.840]   prescription drug treatments
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.720]   and over-the-counter medications of the sort of type
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.960]   that most of us have heard about,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.040]   ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and so forth,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.680]   so-called anti-inflammatory drugs.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.740]   But it turns out there are many natural treatments
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.520]   for headaches that when compared
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.880]   to those over-the-counter drugs
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.560]   and even some prescription drugs appear to be easily
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.360]   as effective and in many cases more effective
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.820]   than the typical drug treatments,
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.720]   many of which can carry side effects.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.760]   That is the drug treatments carry side effects,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.720]   whereas the natural treatments appear
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480]   to not carry side effects.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000]   Now, of course, anytime we have a discussion
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.500]   about natural treatments,
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.400]   there are likely to be some eye rolls out there
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.440]   and people thinking, oh, you know,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.260]   this is going to be a bunch of woo science.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.360]   Well, far from it, as you'll soon learn today,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.600]   each and every one of the treatments
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.200]   for each and every one of the different kinds of headaches
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.140]   is grounded in a solid biological understanding
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.280]   of why that particular treatment ought to work
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.120]   and does work.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.740]   So for instance, you'll learn that some headache arises
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.820]   because of muscular pain, other headache arises
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.420]   because of excessive vasodilation,
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.160]   the arteries and blood vessels get bigger and wider.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.420]   And so there's a pressure and a swelling within the cranium
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.520]   that people experience as a headache.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.040]   And it turns out that many of the more natural treatments
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.700]   out there can address either the muscular pain issue
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.800]   or the vasodilation issue or other issues
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.600]   and underlying mechanisms for headache.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.400]   So again, while headaches are very intrusive, irritating,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.240]   and in some cases debilitating,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.020]   there is certainly light at the end of this tunnel.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.960]   Meaning by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   each and every one of you will have an array
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.500]   of excellent treatment options that you can choose from
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.940]   in order to address and provide relief
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.200]   from any of the different types of headache.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.900]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.600]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.860]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.500]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.200]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.300]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.040]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.120]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.780]   And as many of you know, I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.160]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.340]   And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.080]   there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.440]   The thesis understands this
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.200]   and it has designed different nootropics
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.720]   in order to bring your brain into specific states
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.100]   for specific types of work.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.180]   So for instance, for creative work
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.200]   or to engage with more focus or to give you more energy
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.820]   for cognitive or physical work.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.880]   So with thesis, they'll design custom nootropics for you
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.280]   that will allow you more focus, better task switching,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.900]   more creativity and so on.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.280]   And they'll be sure to include only the ingredients
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.820]   that you want and not the ingredients that you don't.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.020]   I've been using thesis for more than a year now
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.060]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.060]   have been a total game changer for me.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.620]   I like the clarity formula
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.200]   prior to long bouts of cognitive work
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.480]   or the energy formula prior to physical workouts.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.620]   If you'd like to try your own
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.100]   personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.140]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.620]   You'll take a brief three minute quiz
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.520]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.860]   to try in your first month.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.400]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.060]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.080]   for 10% off your first box.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.020]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.180]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.860]   That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.780]   and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.260]   but it has no sugar.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.980]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.660]   about the key role of hydration and electrolytes
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.980]   for nerve cell function, neuron function,
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.780]   as well as the function of all the cells
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.700]   and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.380]   If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium present
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.660]   in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.700]   and all our bodily systems can be optimized.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.540]   If the electrolytes are not present
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.340]   and if hydration is low,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.300]   we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise,
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.680]   our mood is off, hormone systems go off,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.760]   our ability to get into physical action,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.420]   to engage in endurance and strength
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.020]   and all sorts of other things is diminished.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.620]   So with Element, you can make sure
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.280]   that you're staying on top of your hydration
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.120]   and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.460]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.920]   that's lmnt.com/huberman
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.760]   and you'll get a free Element sample pack
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.660]   with your purchase.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.500]   They're all delicious.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.940]   So again, if you want to try Element,
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.480]   you can go to elementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui,
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.540]   which I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.480]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.180]   Maui Nui spent nearly a decade
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.260]   building a USDA certified wild harvesting system
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.460]   to help balance invasive deer populations
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.020]   on the island of Maui.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.620]   I've talked before on this podcast
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.380]   and we've had guests on this podcast
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.360]   that have emphasized the critical role
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.260]   of getting quality protein,
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.620]   not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis,
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.540]   but also for repair of all tissues,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.740]   including brain tissue on a day-to-day basis.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.400]   And the general rule of thumb for that
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.420]   is one gram of quality protein
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.560]   per pound of body weight per day.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.220]   With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.160]   and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.020]   which is also critical for immediate and long-term health.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.340]   I should say that Maui Nui meats
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.640]   are not only extremely high quality,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.620]   but they are also delicious.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.700]   I particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.560]   I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes,
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.080]   including ground venison, some venison steaks,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   and I love the taste of the venison.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.520]   It's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.220]   It's incredibly delicious.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.020]   So if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.740]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman

[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.140]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.380]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.980]   Let's talk about headaches.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.620]   And as we are soon going to learn,
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.420]   there are different types of headaches
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.900]   and different types of headaches arise from changes
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.820]   in different types of tissues in the head area
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.120]   and indeed in the neck area as well.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.900]   Now, one of the key things to understand
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.660]   is that if you want relief from a headache,
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.220]   you need to understand which tissue is mainly involved
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.580]   in creating that type of headache.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.220]   So for instance, many people suffer
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.860]   from what are called tension headaches.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.220]   Now, tension headaches are a little bit of a misnomer
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.580]   because many people might think,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.500]   oh, tension, I'm under a lot of tension and stress
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.900]   and therefore I get tension headaches.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.760]   And indeed, stress can cause tension headaches.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.020]   But tension headaches are really the sort of headache
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.340]   that you feel around the top part of the head,
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.420]   not the very top,
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.980]   but sort of where you would put a headband,
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.740]   so above the eyes and around the head.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.260]   It doesn't have to be experienced
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.700]   all the way around the head.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.260]   But the main underlying reason,
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.100]   that is the tissue system
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.580]   that mainly underlies tension headaches
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.880]   is the muscular system.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.180]   There are a lot of muscles on the skull, believe it or not,
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.040]   of course, on the neck
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.540]   and they allow you to move your neck and head.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.220]   There are a lot of muscles that lie parallel to the skull
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.660]   and oftentimes those muscles
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.380]   will undergo excessive amounts of constriction.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.120]   Now there are of course muscles in the jaw
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.040]   that can also lead to headache and jaw ache
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.780]   and things of that sort and neck aches and headaches.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.300]   So what we're really pointing out here
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.260]   is that the muscles are a key player
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.700]   in the formation of different types of headache,
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.780]   tension headache in particular.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.720]   But of course, muscles and muscle tension
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.300]   can be involved in the other types of headaches as well.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.160]   Okay, so I just want to highlight muscular issues
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.700]   as one particular source of the ache in headaches.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.380]   The other tissue that can be prominently involved
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.580]   in generating the ache of a headache
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.200]   are the so-called meninges.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.860]   Now the meninges, in addition to being a fun word to say,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.800]   are a bunch of tissues that line the outside of the brain
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.120]   and reside between the brain and the skull.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.880]   So you might think, okay, between the brain and the skull,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.220]   there's probably just a little bit of fluid
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.600]   and the brain is right up next to the skull,
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.720]   but it turns out that's not the case.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.440]   The brain is actually encased in a very thick,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.880]   very durable sac or casing
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.440]   that's wrapped around it tight like saran wrap.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.740]   It actually has a name, which is dura, D-U-R-A.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.800]   And so you can remember dura, durable.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   And having done some surgeries, many surgeries before
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.220]   on brains of different types, ranging from human,
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.900]   even though I'm not a neurosurgeon as a clinician,
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.560]   ranging from human to other types of species,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.760]   what you find is that the dura is exceedingly durable.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.280]   Getting through this thing really requires
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.540]   a very sharp razor blade.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.600]   So the brain is actually sitting in a very fibrous-like sac
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.680]   that you simply could not open up with your fingertips
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.600]   under any conditions.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.200]   It's really durable.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.240]   The meninges are in that general area
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.920]   and also encasing the brain.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.080]   And the meninges provide an additional buffer
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.300]   between the brain and the dura and the skull.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.820]   So again, you don't want to think about the brain
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.400]   as just sitting right next to the skull.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.240]   It's close by,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.700]   but there are a bunch of other thin fibrous tissues,
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.400]   many of which are very thin and fragile,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.180]   and others of which such as the dura
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.040]   that are very, very strong because they're very fibrous,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.880]   almost like if you've ever felt, for instance,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.640]   the sail of a sailboat, you might think,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.480]   oh, it's just this big flapping sheet in the wind.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.780]   It is anything but a sheet in the wind.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.780]   It is a very, very strong and durable material.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.360]   Now, the proximity of the dura and the meninges to the brain
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.780]   and the fact that everything is wrapped very tightly
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.500]   together and the fact that there's a lot of vasculature,
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.640]   so that would be arteries, blood vessels, and capillaries
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.560]   are all in that area on the top of the brain
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.720]   and throughout the brain.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.920]   The fact that all of that is in very close proximity
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.880]   and wrapped really tight in this very durable sack
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.640]   is one of the reasons why when blood vessels
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.960]   or arteries or both become dilated, they open,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.160]   there creates a pressure between the brain and those tissues.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.240]   And because there isn't much distance between the tissues
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.640]   like the dura and the meninges and the skull,
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.720]   there's also pressure that allows for the brain
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.240]   to literally sneak up, or I should say,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   give the impression that your brain is expanding
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.640]   up against your skull.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.780]   So the point here is that while muscular tension
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.040]   can give rise to headache,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.680]   the other thing that can give rise to headache
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.420]   is so-called vasodilation, the expansion or the widening
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.120]   of the arteries, blood vessels, and capillaries.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.320]   And one of the reasons why that gives rise to headache
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.240]   is because there's simply not a lot of space
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.200]   for that expansion to go.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.360]   It doesn't allow anything except for the brain
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.800]   to push up against that very durable tissue
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.600]   and that very durable tissue to push up against the skull.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.020]   And even though the brain itself doesn't have pain receptors,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.080]   that's right, the brain itself doesn't have pain receptors,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.120]   that is why a neurosurgeon can take off a piece of skull
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.200]   and can probe around in the brain with an electrode
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.080]   and the person is completely unaware.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.960]   And in order to get through the skull,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.320]   of course a little skin flap has to be removed
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.600]   from the skull, and that requires a little bit
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.760]   of topical anesthetic, but really you don't need
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.720]   any anesthetic to go into the brain itself
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.980]   because there aren't pain receptors on the brain itself.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.480]   However, the tissue surrounding the brain
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.880]   such as the dura, the meninges, and the vasculature
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.620]   that then reaches up, believe it or not, into the skull,
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.160]   the vasculature doesn't actually stop right beneath the skull
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.560]   it actually blood vessels get into the skull
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.240]   and there are actually portals by which blood can move
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.640]   within the skull itself.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.000]   Well, what that means is that since all of the tissues
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.520]   are very close by and very compact
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.120]   with respect to one another, any increase in the size
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.460]   of the portals that allow movement of blood there
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.580]   and the fact that there are what are called nociceptors,
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:32.180]   N-O-C-I, nociceptors, these are essentially pain receptors,
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.780]   because of the presence of pain receptors in the tissues
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.060]   around the brain, when there's an increase in the size
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.140]   of those vascular portals, the arteries, capillaries,
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.140]   and vessels, we experienced that as intense pain
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.260]   and pressure, and fortunately there are excellent treatments
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.700]   for dealing with that intense pain and pressure,
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.900]   but keep in mind that the intense pain and pressure
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.020]   that is the consequence of vasodilation,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.500]   that is the widening of these different vascular portals
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.660]   is very different than the type of pain that arises
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.100]   from muscular tension as is the case with tension headache.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.700]   Okay, so now we have two sources of pain
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.020]   that is the ache in headache, and there are two more
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.580]   that we need to think about in trying to better understand
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.820]   the different types of headaches that we'll discuss
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.060]   and in terms of trying to understand which are going
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.740]   to be the best treatments for the different types
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.380]   of headaches, and those are neural
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.980]   and inflammatory responses.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   So let's talk about the neural type first.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.440]   There is a type of headache that many people unfortunately
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.780]   suffer from, we'll get into this in a bunch more detail
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.580]   in a moment, but those are called cluster headaches.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.140]   Cluster headaches are headaches that arise
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.360]   not from the surface, people don't experience them
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.340]   as kind of a tightening of the forehead and the neck
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.600]   and the jaw, but rather it feels as if the headache
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.980]   is coming from deep within the head, and in particular
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.100]   from behind the orbit of one or the other eyes,
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.700]   and sometimes both eyes.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.460]   For those of you that have ever experienced
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.360]   cluster headaches, they are extremely painful,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.020]   even the more, or I should say the relatively
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.340]   more minor cluster headaches are extremely painful
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.280]   and the severe ones are exceedingly painful.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.440]   Cluster headaches arise from deep, or we get the sensation
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.260]   that they are arising from deep within our head
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.660]   as opposed from the surface inward,
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.440]   because they are neural in origin.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.140]   And there's a particular nerve pathway
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.520]   called the trigeminal nerve that often is the origin
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.480]   of these cluster headaches that people experience
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.460]   behind the eye.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.960]   The trigeminal as the name suggests has three branches,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.940]   tri, okay, so there's a branch that essentially extends
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.040]   to the eye, there's also a branch that extends
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.000]   to the mandible, right, to the lip, and there's a branch
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.540]   that extends more or less to the nasal area.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.580]   And so this trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.480]   or in other ways is hyperactivated in some cases,
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.780]   and that causes the deep pain below the eye
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.300]   because it is that first branch of the trigeminal nerve,
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.060]   which is the ophthalmic branch,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.880]   which tends to be activated first.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.660]   So people start feeling as if there's a pain
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.540]   behind their eye, in particular on one side,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.620]   oftentimes there's lacrimation, which is tearing up,
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.420]   there can be some nasal discharge.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.020]   Another common symptom of this type of headache,
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.980]   that is the cluster headache, is that the pupils
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.920]   sometimes will become very small, the pupils of the eyes,
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.700]   and they won't dilate even in darkness.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.940]   So there are a bunch of things that are going on
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.340]   on one or both sides of the face that seem to arise
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.940]   from deep within the head, or it's almost as if it's coming
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.100]   from the brain outward, and that's because it's neural
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.380]   in origin, okay, so we've got muscular origins of headaches,
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.020]   we've got meningeal origins of headaches,
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.620]   that is the stuff around the brain and as it relates
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.560]   to the vasculature, and we have neural origins of headaches.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.900]   And of course there's inflammation origins of headaches.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.220]   Now inflammation is a term that gets thrown around a lot
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.660]   these days, people are talking about, you know,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.980]   this reduces inflammation and inflammation is bad,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.420]   and I suppose in some cases, and when inflammation
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.220]   is really widespread across the brain or body, it's bad,
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.660]   but I don't think any of us should think about inflammation
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.100]   per se as bad, what I mean is inflammation is just one form
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.180]   of signaling in the body, which of course includes
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.620]   the brain, inflammation of a tissue is one way in which
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.900]   a set of cells, so these could be, for instance,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.340]   cells of the immune system, and we cover this
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.280]   in a detailed episode all about the immune system,
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.440]   if you'd like to check that out, you go to Hubermanlab.com,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.580]   just put into our search function immune system
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.020]   and you can find that episode, by the way,
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.120]   all of our episodes are searchable by keyword
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.500]   at Hubermanlab.com and it'll take you to specific episodes
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.640]   and timestamps for the topics you're interested in,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.660]   so for sake of this discussion about headache,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.900]   inflammation is going to be the case
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.580]   when one particular tissue in and around the head area
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.660]   is releasing molecules, cytokines,
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.600]   which sometimes are called inflammatory cytokines,
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.260]   but there are also non-inflammatory
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.120]   or anti-inflammatory cytokines, but inflammatory molecules
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.980]   that are signaling to the rest of the body,
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.340]   hey, there's something going on here,
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.660]   there's either some intrusive object,
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.840]   and indeed, if you were to get a BB or a splinter
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.080]   into a particular skin area,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.140]   there'd be a lot of inflammation,
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.400]   so it can be the introduction of a foreign physical object
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.380]   into an area that will cause inflammation,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.340]   it can be the presence of some sort of local toxin
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.380]   in that area, it could be a more systemic inflammation,
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.060]   nonetheless, inflammation in the neck and head area
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.780]   or frankly anywhere within the sinus area,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.480]   so this would include the mouth, the nose, around the eyes,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.540]   because the sinuses, many of us think of sinuses
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.820]   as just our nose, but actually,
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.900]   if I were to show you a skull, a human skull
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.820]   or any other kind of skull, you'd be very hopefully
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.620]   intrigued to learn that the skull is just not one big piece
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.220]   of solid bone or a top with a jaw below it,
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.620]   it actually has all these small
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.300]   what are called fenestrations, little holes and canals
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   that run through the skull and through the depth of the skull
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.420]   like little tubes, you've got them down here
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.100]   on your mandible, you've got them above your lips,
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.300]   you have them on either sides of your nose,
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.100]   those are the sinuses, the sinuses allow the passage
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.660]   of different fluids through the skull
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.980]   because the skull, even though it's bone,
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.820]   it's not a dead tissue, right?
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.540]   In a live person or animal,
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.260]   the skull is a very active living tissue,
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.580]   indeed all bone is active living tissue
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.700]   and it needs to be nourished with blood,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.940]   it needs to be nourished with cerebral spinal fluid,
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.340]   in the case of the skull, it needs to be nourished
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.940]   with all sorts of important things,
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.780]   so those sinuses oftentimes can become clogged
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.500]   as is in the case with sinus headache,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.460]   which we'll talk about in a little bit,
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.240]   but more generally, anytime there's inflammation
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.780]   of one given area of the body, so it could be a shoulder,
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.060]   it could be the neck, it could be the mouth,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.640]   it could be the nose, or in the case of the headache,
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.960]   it could be any portion of the head or neck,
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.700]   what happens is inflammation,
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.280]   while it's a very efficient signal,
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.580]   it's much like the siren on an ambulance or a police car
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.240]   in that it sends out a very broad signal
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.480]   that's very clear something is wrong here
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.200]   and needs to be dealt with, it's not very specific,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.700]   so it's very robust, but it's not very specific,
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.760]   so for instance, if there's a little bacterial infection
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.580]   or a little viral infection,
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.260]   the inflammation response to that site of infection
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.660]   tends to be far more widespread
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.980]   than the actual site of infection,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.820]   it's a little bit different
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.040]   when you have a foreign object there,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.280]   like a splinter or some other foreign object,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.100]   that tends to be a bit more localized,
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.380]   and the immune system is always trying to limit
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.220]   the extent of inflammation
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.920]   by putting in different scar tissues,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.500]   indeed, a lot of the things that we think of
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.060]   as kind of gross pussy, you know,
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.620]   pustules and boils and things like that,
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.780]   I know it's a gross topic,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.660]   are ways in which our body tries to restrict
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.120]   the amount of inflammation,
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.940]   but the face area and the head itself
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.420]   are so heavily infused with blood vessels
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.780]   and there's a constant perfusion, as we say,
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.980]   of blood and cerebral spinal fluid and other things
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.300]   through this incredibly metabolically active tissue
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.480]   that we call our brain and our eyes,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.900]   those are by far the most metabolically active tissues
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.020]   in our entire body,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.340]   even if we're running hundreds of miles in ultra marathons,
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.960]   your brain is still far more metabolically demanding
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.120]   than all the muscles of your body combined,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.220]   no matter what the conditions.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.220]   Because of that, there tends to be a generalization
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.860]   or a spreading out of any inflammatory response,
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.900]   and that inflammatory response then can trigger
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.220]   the pain mechanisms or what we've experienced
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.840]   as pain mechanisms in the other three types of tissues
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   that we talked about.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.640]   So for instance, if you have a systemic infection
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.260]   or you're experiencing inflammation of any kind,
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.220]   and it has anything to do with or encroaches on the face
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.140]   or head area, that can easily and almost always
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.140]   spills over into activation of nerve cells,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.380]   can give rise to neural-based headache or to the meninges
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.380]   and can give rise to meningeal headaches,
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.820]   and of course, to the muscles and to muscular-type headaches.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.680]   So we've got muscular origins of the ache in headache,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.700]   we have meningeal origins of the ache in headache,
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.220]   we have neural origins of the ache in headache,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.760]   and we have inflammation-based origins
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.140]   of the ache in headache.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.420]   And that pertains to all the different types of headaches
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.460]   that we're going to talk about.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.020]   And it's important to keep in mind
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.940]   that there are these different sources
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.940]   of the ache in headache and that sometimes they exist alone
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.780]   and sometimes they exist in combination.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.140]   However, and this is an important however,
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.300]   all pain, or I should say all experience of pain
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.000]   as a perception is going to be neural in origin.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.460]   When we experience pain, whether or not it's a pinprick
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.260]   or a cut, stub our toe, we trip and fall, or a headache,
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.760]   it is neural in origin.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.140]   It is the nervous system and nerve cells
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.380]   that are going to carry that signal
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.980]   that we perceive as pain.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.420]   So as we talk about the different sources of pain
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.800]   and different types of headache,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.940]   we will also talk about, of course,
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.100]   I think what most people are interested
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.180]   in today's discussion, the different treatments
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.300]   for the different types of headache
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.560]   and why each of those different treatments work.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.380]   But by understanding a little bit
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.040]   about how pain arises in the nervous system
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.220]   and certainly by understanding the different types
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.340]   of headaches, you know, what is a tension headache?
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.620]   I gave you some impression that it's running around
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.940]   your head like a headband in many cases
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.260]   versus cluster headache, which starts deep below the eye.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.700]   Often it feels as if it's emerging from deep in the brain
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.560]   versus migraine, which we'll get into in a moment.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.200]   By understanding the different types of headaches,
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.420]   you should be able to quickly pinpoint
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.660]   what type of headache you have,
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.220]   what types of tissues are likely involved,
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.460]   and therefore what types of treatments
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.320]   are going to most quickly and most completely
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.800]   relieve that type of headache.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.600]   Okay, so for the next three to five minutes,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.880]   and I promise no more, I'm going to explain
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.320]   how pain arises at the level of nerve cells.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.520]   And I suppose this is one of those times
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.200]   when if I had a highlighter pen that could go out
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.520]   across the microphones and speakers leading to your ears,
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.840]   I would use it here because what I'm about to tell you
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.180]   is perhaps one of the most important things to understand
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.860]   about your nervous system, that is your brain and you,
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.400]   which is that while you have trillions of neurons,
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.420]   and we hear that you have trillions
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.080]   in different types of neurons in your brain,
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.500]   and they come in different shapes and sizes
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.280]   and do different things, and some make dopamine,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.920]   and some make serotonin, and some make glutamate,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.000]   and on and on.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.020]   The key distinction among different types of neurons,
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.760]   that is the three types of neurons that I believe everybody,
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.340]   scientists or no, everybody should understand exist,
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.820]   are some neurons, nerve cells,
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.100]   are what we call motor neurons in the sense
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.280]   that they control the contraction of muscles.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.840]   Sometimes for walking, other neurons control
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.460]   the movements of your fingers,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.320]   scientists call those digits, other ones your toes.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.120]   They also control the beating of your heart,
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.720]   although that's a slightly different mechanism
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.380]   and slightly different type of tissue
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.720]   than is involved in generating motor movements of your limbs.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.120]   These are neurons that we call motor neurons
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.660]   because their goal or their purpose, I should say,
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.560]   they don't really know what their goal or purpose is,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.140]   but what they do is they make sure that muscles contract
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.500]   so that certain things happen in your body,
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.180]   like your heartbeats, or you move your limbs,
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.640]   you lift your eyelids or your eyebrows rather,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.900]   and so on and so forth.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.060]   Other types of neurons are what we call sensory neurons.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.500]   They communicate the same way that motor neurons do,
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.420]   that is they fire what we call action potentials,
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.780]   which are just electrical signals,
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.380]   they release neurotransmitters like any other neuron,
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.060]   but they respond to certain events in the environment
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.380]   or the environment within the body,
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.500]   but they are not responsible
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.160]   for generating muscular contractions.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.460]   So we call these sensory neurons.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.320]   Some sensory neurons sense light touch,
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.060]   other sensory neurons sense firm touch,
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.100]   other sensory neurons sense pain,
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.680]   other sensory neurons sense light brushing on the skin.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.620]   In fact, you have sensory neurons, believe it or not,
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.780]   that respond specifically to the light brushing of a hand
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.380]   across your skin, any region of your body,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.380]   and if that particular region of your body
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.540]   happens to have hair on it,
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.760]   and you stroke the skin in the direction
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.140]   that the hairs lay down, we experience that as pleasurable,
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.320]   whereas if you stroke in the direction opposite
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.180]   to the way the hairs lay down,
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.340]   we experience that as not pleasurable.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.500]   So these sensory neurons respond, in some cases,
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.520]   for instance, within the auditory system,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.620]   they respond to sound waves,
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.620]   in your eye, they respond to photons of light,
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.820]   sometimes photons of light of particular wavelengths
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.300]   that we think of as red, green, blue, and so on.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.320]   Sensory neurons don't move muscles,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.040]   they respond to things in the environment,
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.060]   and they exist within us.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   So we have sensory neurons that sense, for instance,
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.780]   pressure within our head, or pressure within our gut,
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.160]   how full or empty our gut is, pain within our tissues,
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.980]   like our liver or any kind of other internal organ.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.260]   So we've got motor neurons, sensory neurons,
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.980]   and then the last kind of neuron
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.460]   is what we call modulatory neurons.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.740]   These are the ones that adjust the relationship
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.140]   between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.980]   to determine whether or not we do anything
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.760]   in response to a sensory input.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.020]   That is whether or not if a sensory neuron fires,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.280]   sends an electrical potential,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.060]   whether or not it will generate a motor change.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.800]   Let me give you a very simple example of this.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.540]   So for those of you listening,
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.140]   I'll just explain what I'm doing,
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.820]   and for those of you watching, you'll be able to see,
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.960]   I'm holding my hand out in front of me.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.120]   If I were to touch the top of my hand with my fingertip,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.800]   I can deliberately override,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.160]   that is I can modulate that more typical reflex,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.600]   which is that when something touches us,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.320]   if we're not aware of where it's coming from,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   we typically move away from that thing that touches.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.840]   This is a very natural response,
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.380]   but we can decide we're not going to move away.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.940]   We can decide to stay still,
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.440]   or we can decide to move toward the thing that touches us.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.200]   But typically, if you were to walk up to somebody
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.040]   and you were to touch them,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.000]   they'd either turn toward you on the side
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.900]   that you touch them, or they'd step away.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.740]   It's rare that they're going to step into you.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.240]   But you could decide that you were not going to move away,
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.560]   or you could step into the direction of touch.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.500]   And that's because you have modulatory neurons
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.040]   that can adjust the conversation
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.080]   in a very context-dependent way
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.020]   as to whether or not the sensory neuron
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.000]   will cause motor neurons to contract or not, okay?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.200]   So we've got motor neurons, sensory neurons,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.300]   and modulatory neurons.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.280]   And you're probably thinking by now,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.200]   why are we talking about this?
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.380]   I thought we were going to talk about headache.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.720]   I thought we were gonna talk about treatments for headache,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.780]   but this turns out to be very important
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.160]   because you could imagine,
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.100]   and in a moment I'll explain how,
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.620]   let's say you have tension headaches.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.880]   You're somebody that has the classic symptoms
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   of tension headache.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.000]   Let me tell you what those are.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   These are headaches, again,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.540]   that occur more or less in a kind of a headband-like fashion
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.460]   or they tend to start there and exist around the head.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.100]   These are very common.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.300]   They can arise from a number of different sources.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.600]   They can arise from sleep deprivation.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.640]   They can arise from excessive use of caffeine intake.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.120]   We'll talk about why that is.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.360]   They can arise from stress.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.240]   They can arise from very low level viral infections
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.560]   or bacterial infections,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.240]   but we experience these as just as headaches
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.880]   or you've been thinking too hard or working too hard
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.960]   or life has been stressful.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.640]   They're often also associated with jaw pain
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.240]   and jaw tightness and neck tightness.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.060]   So tension headaches,
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.720]   everything you'd imagine muscular tension could cause.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.680]   Well, if you want to treat tension headache,
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.360]   you can imagine that because all headache is neural,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.920]   that you'd want to go after some sort of neural mechanism
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.960]   to treat them.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.400]   But of course, we now know that there are three types
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.240]   of neurons.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.020]   There are motor neurons, sensory neurons,
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.540]   and modulatory neurons.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.040]   So we have choices.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   We can say, okay, do we want to turn off the muscles
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.760]   in the head, jaw, and neck that are hyper contracted?
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.600]   For instance, you want to take a muscle relaxer or relaxant,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.000]   or would you want to try and change the sensory input itself?
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.120]   Maybe don't change the way the muscles are behaving,
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.640]   but shut off the sensory part of it.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.840]   Your ability to sense it.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.160]   There are certainly ways you can do that.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.320]   Or would you want to adjust the modulatory neurons?
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.720]   Would you want to make it such that you have the headache,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.300]   but you don't perceive the headache?
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.100]   That is you cut off communication between the sensor
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.400]   and the motor so that the muscles relax.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.520]   It turns out there are treatments and approaches
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.000]   for each and every one of those.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.680]   Each and every one of those has different advantages
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.880]   and disadvantages.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.640]   But as you can quickly see,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.680]   we are going to have different types of headaches
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.300]   and different approaches to treating headache.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.600]   But if you keep in the back of your mind
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.760]   that you have neurons that contract muscles
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.360]   to create movement or tension of muscles,
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.520]   remember you can turn off those neurons
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.880]   and allow those muscles to relax.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.080]   You have sensory neurons that sense input
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.680]   and actually sense the pain.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.080]   And you have modulatory neurons,
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.600]   which can allow you to adjust the relationship
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.720]   between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.560]   And of course, some of you are probably screaming at me
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.080]   by now saying, "Wait, why would you ever want to deal
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.840]   with the motor neurons or the modulatory neurons
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.340]   once you want to just go straight to the source
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.640]   and just cut off the pain?"
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.200]   Ah, well, the problem there is that many painkillers
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.020]   have other issues as well.
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.980]   In particular, they can be sedative.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.800]   Many of them can be habit forming or even addictive.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.220]   And for many people, not all, but many people,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.520]   they don't want to take drugs,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.580]   whether or not they're over-the-counter
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.420]   or prescription drugs
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.620]   or even more natural supplement-based type treatments.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.260]   And they would rather use, for instance,
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.320]   a behavioral approach in which they can modulate,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.640]   they can deliberately turn off the communication
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.240]   between sensory neurons and motor neurons.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.500]   It turns out those approaches exist as well.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.940]   Okay, so at this point, I promise you
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.560]   that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.200]   in terms of pain sensing and headaches
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.040]   as a more conceptual phenomenon.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.280]   Instead, what I'd like to do next
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.600]   is talk about the different types of headaches.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   And I think this is something that's very important
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.080]   and not often discussed, except for those people out there
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.380]   that unfortunately suffer repeatedly
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.320]   from certain kinds of headaches like migraine
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.440]   or cluster or attention headache.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.020]   But I think for most people out there
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.160]   who experience headache, and again,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.740]   that is everybody at some point experiences headache,
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.480]   rather than just think of headache as one thing,
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.000]   understanding the major types of headache
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.340]   and how they differ from and are similar to one another
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.800]   will really help you identify
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.020]   what the best source of treatments for those are.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.220]   So I'd like to talk about
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.360]   what the different types of headache are now.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.080]   The first type of headache we're going to discuss
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.440]   is the tension type headache.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.760]   Again, tension type headaches tend to start off,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.840]   not always, but tend to start off
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.460]   as more or less a halo or a headband
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.180]   around the forehead in the area above the eyes,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.120]   often also include the jaw, the neck muscles,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.840]   and can extend even into the upper back.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.040]   Again, this can be caused by some low level of infection,
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.480]   but more often than not,
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.500]   tension type headaches are going to come on
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.960]   because of some chronic psychological stress,
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.440]   usually combined with lack of sleep,
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.480]   usually combined with lifestyle issues.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.860]   And of course, without getting into a long discussion
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.800]   about it, anytime you have lack of sleep,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.980]   you're going to have excessive stress.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.720]   Anytime you have excessive stress,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.400]   you're going to have to make sure you're offsetting that
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.280]   by getting proper sleep.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.360]   Most people don't when they're under excessive stress.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.440]   By the way, we have excellent tools
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.060]   or grounded in excellent science
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.400]   available to you at zero cost.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.440]   If you are experienced chronic stress
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   or even short-term stress,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.900]   we have a master stress episode
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.820]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.280]   Again, just go to hubermanlab.com
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.020]   and all that's timestamped for you.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.460]   Tension type headaches begin in a,
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.740]   more or less a headband pattern,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.940]   but can really extend to other tissues as well.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.060]   Not so often in the face,
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.100]   but really the head and often will start to climb up
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.460]   toward the top of the head.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.780]   They are not always in this halo pattern.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.140]   Sometimes they can be localized to one area,
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.540]   such as the back of the head or the front of the head
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.200]   or one side of the head more than others.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.120]   And that's often the case because of tension
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.980]   within muscles of the neck
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   that tend to bias the ache towards one side of the head.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.380]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.420]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.900]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.260]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.140]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.840]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.060]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.660]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.720]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.700]   once or usually twice a day
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.620]   is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.300]   that I need for gut health.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.420]   Our gut is very important.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.960]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.720]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.120]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.780]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.620]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.460]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.020]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.940]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.820]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.260]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.720]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.120]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.080]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.400]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.680]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.000]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.400]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.080]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.440]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.360]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.200]   The other type of headache
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.660]   that unfortunately is very common is migraine headaches.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.400]   Migraine headaches are defined generally
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.160]   as disorders of recurring attacks of headaches.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.520]   So people who get migraines often get them
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.840]   in a recurring fashion.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.400]   Some people get them very often,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.280]   other people get them less often,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.960]   but migraines are very debilitating.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.200]   The numbers, that is the prevalence of migraine,
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.640]   is still pretty debated.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.960]   One thing that we know for sure is that females suffer
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.240]   from migraine headaches at a rate
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   at least threefold higher than do males.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.820]   And surprisingly, this does not seem
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.280]   to have any direct hormonal origin
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.320]   because we're also going to talk about hormonal headaches.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.760]   That is, headaches that relate to a dip
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.000]   in estrogen and progesterone,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.680]   a particular phase of the menstrual cycle,
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.120]   that is the ovulatory cycle.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.760]   So there's a bit of a mystery here.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.460]   And the mystery is why is it that migraine headaches occur
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.680]   at such greater frequency in females,
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.320]   even independently of the menstrual cycle?
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.520]   So when you control for changes in hormones,
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.940]   that still appears to be the case.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.640]   And overall, migraines are very common.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.360]   Now, the numbers on migraine and just how common migraine is
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.920]   are extremely wide.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.500]   This was a little bit frustrating for me
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.380]   in researching this episode.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.920]   You will find, for instance,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.740]   that 17% of women suffer from migraines.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.400]   You will also hear that 6% of males suffer from migraines.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   You will also hear that 43, 43% of females suffer
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.480]   from migraine, that is recurring headaches
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.440]   that qualify as migraine headaches.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.600]   And that 17% of men suffer from migraine headaches
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.160]   on a recurring basis, which is, again,
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.400]   the definition of a migraine headache
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.000]   or one of the key definitions.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.800]   So all we can say for sure is that many,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.680]   many millions of people, maybe even billions of people,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.560]   suffer from migraine headaches.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.600]   It's kind of a staggering thing to contemplate,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.120]   but we know it's extremely common.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.640]   And we know that it's more prevalent in females.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.440]   In any of the studies that you will find in terms of,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.320]   that compare the overall prevalence of headache,
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.200]   it's going to be higher,
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.000]   substantially higher in females and males,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.160]   does not seem to be related
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.320]   to the ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.640]   There are some interesting facts related to that
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.500]   that I'll just touch on for a moment.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.080]   Pregnancy, for whatever reason,
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.380]   seems to be protective against migraine headaches.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.720]   That is, women who suffer from recurring migraines
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.600]   before they get pregnant, when they get pregnant,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.740]   and often after they give birth,
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.480]   they experience fewer migraine headaches.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.060]   So there may be something hormonal,
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.720]   it may be something else.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.640]   What do we know for sure?
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.920]   We know that headache,
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.160]   that is the ache in headache, is neural.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.060]   So whether or not the origins are hormonal
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.640]   or whether or not the origins are inflammation
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.560]   or gut microbiome or some other feature
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.620]   of the body-brain axis,
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.180]   at this point, all we know is that neural pain
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.060]   or the experience of pain at the neural level
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.460]   is the final common pathway,
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.380]   and it's more prevalent in females.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.640]   So as I mentioned, migraines tend to be recurring.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.960]   So some people get them once a week,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.220]   some people get them once a month,
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.840]   some people get them far more frequently,
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.140]   that they can be extremely debilitating.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.840]   Oftentimes, people who experience migraine
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.800]   because it is a recurring phenomenon
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.960]   will know when a migraine is coming on.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.340]   They'll say, "My migraine is coming on,"
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.740]   they kind of sense it coming.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.480]   There's this notion of aura,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.560]   and we'll talk about aura in a little bit.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.220]   Some people think of aura just as visual aura
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.580]   or the sense of kind of a haloing of light
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.920]   or the sense that there's something outside the body.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.060]   The actual definition of aura is that it's the experience
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.080]   that something is about to happen.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.020]   It's this kind of feeling of anticipation.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.120]   It's not deja vu.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.600]   Deja vu is different and very interesting in its own right,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.440]   but different.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   It's this feeling that something's about to happen.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.240]   And the fact that aura is such a prominent feature
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.360]   of migraine headaches,
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.120]   or at least that people feel that the headache is coming on
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.900]   long before they feel the actual ache of the headache
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.780]   and the other debilitating symptoms,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.240]   suggests that migraine has something of deep neural origin,
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.320]   that it arises from deep within the nervous system,
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.600]   spinal cord and brain,
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.260]   and that it's not something like a tension headache
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.240]   that is going from outside in,
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.100]   the constriction of the muscles in the jaw and head.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.720]   So migraine headaches are very different
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.840]   than tension headaches,
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.000]   even in terms of how they come on or their onset.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.560]   The other feature of migraine headaches
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.140]   that I think is important to note
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.440]   is that dilation of the vessels.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.480]   Remember the vasodilation,
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.520]   so the widening of those pipes that we call arteries,
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.060]   vessels, and capillaries,
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.280]   is a very prominent feature of migraine.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.640]   And fortunately that allows
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.100]   for very particular types of treatment
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.240]   and ways of dealing with the pain
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.920]   specific to migraine headaches.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.820]   The other feature that's common in migraine headaches
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.360]   is so-called photophobia.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.700]   Many of you are probably familiar with photophobia
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.980]   if you've ever been sleep deprived.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.680]   Simply if you're sleep deprived
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.880]   and you go outside in the morning,
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.560]   the light is going to seem very, very bright,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.080]   much brighter than were you to have had
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.980]   a really good night's sleep.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.180]   And that's because during sleep,
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.120]   there are all sorts of reset mechanisms in the brain.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.560]   There's the washing out of metabolic debris
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.400]   and things in the brain,
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.800]   the so-called glymphotic washout that's essential.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.340]   There's also an adjustment of the neural tissue of the eyes,
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.200]   which as many of you have heard me say before,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.460]   are actually two pieces of brain
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.240]   that have been extruded from the cranial vault.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.320]   So your eyes, yes, indeed are two pieces of brain,
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.280]   the only two pieces of brain outside the cranial vault.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.880]   And within your eyes,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.560]   you have neurons and mechanisms
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   that adjust the sort of sensitivity of your eyes to light
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.760]   and of your brain to light.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.120]   And when you are sleep deprived
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.280]   or when you have a low level viral infection
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.160]   or a cold or a flu of any kind,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.360]   you tend to experience light as brighter than it actually is
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.600]   when you're rested or you're in the healthy state.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.000]   So photophobia is something
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   that's very, very common in migraine.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.560]   And often the photophobia is a prominent feature
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.840]   of the experience that a migraine is coming on.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.680]   People will start saying,
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.920]   "Oh, you know, it's just too bright in here."
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.460]   And normally they'd be able to tolerate
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.680]   that level of sunlight or indoor lighting with no problem.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.720]   So there are two aspects of migraine
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.560]   that I think are particularly important to understand
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.800]   for sake of the treatment,
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.560]   and that's the dilation of vessels.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.160]   So if we want to treat migraine,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.560]   we're going to have to think about things
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.780]   that can constrict blood vessels in the brain area.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.440]   But we also need to think about photophobia,
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.120]   not photophobia just as a symptom of migraine,
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.560]   but that maybe by adjusting our sensitivity to light,
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.920]   we can actually short circuit some of the onset
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.140]   and subsequent pathology of the migraine.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.280]   That is, if we can prevent photophobia,
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.900]   partially or completely,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.220]   can actually offset a lot of the ache of the migraine
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.520]   that would otherwise occur.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.300]   So that's an exciting avenue
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.380]   for addressing migraine headaches.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.380]   We'll get into photophobia and how to deal with that.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.860]   We'll also talk about aura a little bit more
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.880]   in a few minutes.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.940]   But for the time being, we've talked about tension headaches.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.580]   We've now talked about migraine headaches.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.540]   Again, keep in mind,
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.420]   knowing what kind of headache you have is essential.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.360]   It's, I would say, indispensable
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.960]   for selecting the best treatment.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.040]   Many people out there will simply get a headache
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.400]   and decide, oh, I'm going to pop a couple of aspirin.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.640]   Okay, what does aspirin do?
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.000]   Aspirin's an anti-inflammatory.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.460]   It also has pronounced effects on the vasodilation
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.720]   and vasoconstriction system.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.260]   It actually allows more blood to flow
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.580]   through those arteries, vessels, and capillaries.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.560]   A lot of people actually use baby aspirin
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.160]   or small amounts of aspirin
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.120]   as a way to offset cardiovascular disease.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.080]   That's another discussion, but what do we know?
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.240]   We know that in migraine,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.300]   there's a hyperdilation of the blood vessels,
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.620]   a hyperdilation of the very little portals
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.140]   that exist in the brain and around the brain
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.220]   and that are going to cause the pain.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.880]   They're going to activate those sensory neurons,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.620]   those nociceptors, that will then give us the experience
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.280]   of extreme headache and migraine.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.100]   So taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine,
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.380]   in some cases, the worst possible choice.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.940]   Again, so knowing what kind of headache you are experiencing
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.320]   is going to be essential here.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.460]   The other thing that you'll sometimes hear
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.000]   is that drinking a cup of coffee
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.980]   or getting caffeine through tea
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.360]   is a great way to deal with headache.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.240]   Why would that be?
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.600]   Well, it turns out that coffee
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.360]   can cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation,
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.440]   depending on when you take it.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.020]   And we'll get into the use of caffeine
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.360]   as a treatment for headache,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.160]   because indeed it can be a very potent treatment
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.200]   for headache, but you absolutely need to know
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.580]   what kind of headache you are experiencing,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.200]   because in some cases, drinking caffeine,
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.980]   whether it's in tea or coffee,
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.120]   can absolutely alleviate the pain of a headache,
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.680]   especially if you catch that onset of a migraine
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.640]   or a tension type headache early on.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.900]   But in some cases, it can make it far, far worse.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.560]   Again, knowing which type of headache you're experiencing
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.600]   and how the different treatments work is key.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.220]   Okay, so we have tension type headaches,
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.400]   migraine type headaches.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.440]   I think you're starting to get the picture.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.240]   They have different underlying biologies.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.560]   The next type of headache is cluster headaches.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.480]   Cluster headaches are the ones I mentioned earlier
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.000]   that arise from deep within the head.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   They feel as if they're coming from the inside out,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.140]   and they tend to be on one side or the other,
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.520]   what scientists and clinicians call unilateral.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.360]   It tends to originate behind the eye
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.880]   and sometimes the nose region,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.760]   sometimes in the mouth region as well.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.120]   It feels kind of patchy,
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.440]   but as if it's coming from the inside out.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.320]   And again, that's because of that trigeminal nerve.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.760]   For those of you listening
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.300]   and not watching this on YouTube,
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.440]   I've got three fingers,
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   as if I'm putting up three fingers in them.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.920]   I've got one pointed toward my eye,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.880]   one pointed towards my nose region,
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.360]   and one towards my upper lip.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.920]   The trigeminal nerve is an easy one to remember,
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.160]   and it will completely explain cluster headaches
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.280]   and what to do about cluster headaches.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.000]   In a moment, if you remember that the herpes 1 virus,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.200]   and not herpes 2, not genital herpes,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.980]   but herpes 1 virus is the one
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.480]   that gives cold sores on the mouth.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.720]   Herpes 1 virus, by the way, is exceedingly common,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.000]   up to 90% of people.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.320]   Many children, in fact, have these.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.760]   Again, this is not a sexually transmitted herpes,
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.120]   although it can be, of course,
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.000]   transmitted through kissing and sexual contact,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.600]   but that's not the only origin of it.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.420]   Okay, it can be passed by skin contact and mucosal contact.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.400]   So mucosal, mucosal, so that would be kissing,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.520]   mucosal lining, or even skin to mucosal lining,
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.980]   so that's why it's so common.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.260]   And the reason why cold sores develop on the mouth
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.920]   for people that have herpes 1
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.580]   is because the virus actually lives on the trigeminal nerve.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.520]   And yes, it is true that sometimes the virus
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.960]   will inflame the nerve and the inflammation will occur
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.800]   at the level of the eye,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.920]   so people do, unfortunately, sometimes get herpes of the eye
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.320]   and actually can be quite dangerous
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.880]   if you have an infection of the eye,
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.840]   a herpes infection of the eye,
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.600]   you should see an ophthalmologist.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.480]   Or the nose region, they can experience pain
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.640]   in the mucosal tissue of the nose.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.480]   More often than not, most inflammation is occurring
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.180]   on the branch that innervates the lip
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.460]   or the region close to the lip,
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.140]   and that's why a cold sore develops there,
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.040]   an immune response there,
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.700]   signaling that there's inflammation due to the herpes virus,
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.160]   which lives on that neuron for a very long time.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.440]   Neurons don't turn over in the lifespan,
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.640]   so it can live on there for the extent of the person's life.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.960]   However, most people hopefully treat their HSV-1,
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.480]   but if they don't, the sort of frequency
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.980]   and the severity of infections
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.020]   tends to taper off with time.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.840]   I'll have an entire discussion about viruses
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.340]   and herpes in particular in a future episode.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.640]   But the thing to keep in mind here is that this very nerve
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.840]   is the one that gets inflamed
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.720]   in these cluster type headaches.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.680]   Now, cluster type headaches are associated
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.600]   with a bunch of very uncomfortable symptoms.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.920]   Again, they tend to be unilateral,
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.760]   they tend to begin very deep,
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.700]   and they tend to be excruciatingly painful,
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.880]   excruciatingly painful.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.680]   They can last anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.320]   Some people experience these in sleep.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.940]   In fact, this is one of the cases
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:11.180]   where men experience a headache more than females.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.900]   Men experience cluster type headaches
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.300]   that have a sudden onset during sleep.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.400]   At five times the frequency than do females.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   The origins of that aren't exactly clear.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.880]   They do seem to have something to do
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.600]   with the biological clock mechanisms,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.800]   the so-called circadian mechanisms.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.880]   So if you are a man or a woman for that matter,
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.240]   and you're waking up in the middle of the night
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.560]   with a unilateral headache,
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.760]   and it seems like it's deep within your head,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.680]   or it's starting there,
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.780]   and it's on one side and localized to the eye,
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.360]   and maybe these other regions the trigeminal is involved in,
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.340]   you may be suffering from cluster type headache,
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.680]   and you should talk to your physician.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.160]   The other symptom that's quite common
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.040]   in cluster type headache is a droopy eyelid,
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.880]   which should make sense
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.160]   because the trigeminal innervates the eye region,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.400]   and there are other nerves that control the eyelid,
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.880]   but they're in that general region and they can be impacted.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.560]   The other thing is something called meiosis,
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.940]   which is that you can't dilate the pupil.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.780]   I mentioned this before,
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.520]   so that your pupils might get really, really small
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.240]   and they won't dilate.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.200]   And the other thing is lacrimation, tearing,
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.520]   and then nasal discharge,
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.240]   all because of a neural inflammation problem.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.280]   Why do I tell you with such detail about cluster headaches?
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   Well, if you are somebody that's experiencing
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.120]   the kind of pain that is consistent with cluster headache,
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.640]   taking a standard anti-inflammatory,
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.200]   or doing something that is going to adjust the, excuse me,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.400]   the dilation or constriction of blood vessels
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.500]   may have an indirect impact on cluster headache,
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.460]   but is unlikely to relieve cluster headache,
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.440]   either acutely, meaning right away,
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.240]   or in preventing cluster headaches.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.280]   You have to deal with this as a neural issue.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.920]   And we'll talk about some of the main causes of inflammation
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.380]   and activation of these cluster type headaches
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.680]   at the level of the trigeminal nerve in a little bit,
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.800]   because fortunately there are some excellent treatments.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.280]   The next type of headache that is quite common
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.920]   are hormonal headaches.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.540]   Now, the phrase hormonal headache should already cue you
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.160]   to the fact that it's far too general a term,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.240]   because there are so many different hormones,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.160]   testosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone, growth hormone,
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.660]   and on and on and on.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.560]   And they all have many different functions
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.840]   in the brain and body.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.720]   Every single hormone,
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.100]   and in particular the so-called steroid hormones,
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.320]   steroids, again, not just limited to things
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   that people take for sports.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.000]   In fact, the steroid hormones refers to estrogen,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.240]   testosterone of the sort that we all make,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.580]   that men and women make naturally.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.920]   And those steroid hormones can impact gene expression.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.280]   They can, or of course,
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.980]   what turns on the growth of the breast tissue,
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.040]   of the testicular tissue, of the hair growth,
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.280]   and on and on.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.040]   And that's all because of gene expression.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.720]   If you're really going to change the identity
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.060]   and function of a cell long-term, right,
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.840]   you're going to literally change the breast tissue
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.940]   or change the penile tissue or change the ovarian tissue
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.480]   in some sort of consistent way across the lifespan,
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.540]   you can bet that there are changes in gene expression.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.140]   And those changes in gene expression occur
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.920]   because the steroid hormones have this incredible ability,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.960]   sort of like the X-Men of hormones,
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.580]   to pass through the outer membrane of a cell,
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.860]   which we call the exocellular membrane,
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.520]   and into the so-called nuclear membrane.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.680]   They can go into the area where genes are made
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.160]   and turn on and off different genes.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.660]   However, they multitask in their life.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.360]   That is, these steroid hormones,
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.180]   like estrogen in particular and testosterone in particular,
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.360]   can also bind to the surface of cells
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.240]   and impact all sorts of things at the level of the cells
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.500]   that have nothing to do with changes in gene expression.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.360]   And that second mechanism of binding to the surface of cells
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.320]   is one of the ways in which estrogen
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.540]   can control different aspects of headache.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:30.680]   Now, that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.500]   that estrogen gives you headaches.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.360]   In fact, it's just the opposite.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.560]   It turns out that low estrogen and another hormone,
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   low progesterone, combine to give rise to headache
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.780]   because of the ways that low estrogen and low progesterone
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.680]   impact vasodilation and vasoconstriction
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.300]   and the inflammatory response.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.340]   We'll talk about how to deal with hormone-based headaches,
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.900]   in particular, hormone-based headaches
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.300]   that occur because of low estrogen
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.820]   and progesterone in a moment.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.860]   But the key thing to know is something that we covered
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.380]   in the fertility episode.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.040]   I did a very long, very detailed episode on fertility,
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.520]   so I'm not going to go into this in significant detail now.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.900]   You can refer to that episode for probably more detail
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.680]   than you ever wanted, but also a lot of tools
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.200]   as it relates to fertility in both males and females.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.360]   But right now, I'm just going to give you
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.560]   a course overview of that in about 60 to 120 seconds
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.920]   so that you'll understand when hormonal headaches
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.240]   are most likely to take place.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.800]   Keep in mind that hormonal headaches
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.980]   are most likely to take place
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.520]   when estrogen and progesterone are lowest.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.880]   So if you understand that during the follicular stage
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.360]   of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, okay,
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.800]   so menstrual cycle is about 28 days on average,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.400]   not in everyone, but it's about 28 days on average,
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.880]   and the first half of that,
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.340]   estrogen starts creeping up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.240]   And as we learn in endocrinology,
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.900]   estrogen primes progesterone.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.760]   So estrogen will then peak and then start to fall,
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.020]   low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low,
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.320]   pretty quickly, right about the time
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.580]   that the egg ovulates.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:07.000]   An egg is released and will essentially be ready
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.880]   for fertilization if the egg is fertilized,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.600]   a whole bunch of other things happen
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.840]   as it relates to pregnancy.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.660]   If not, what ends up happening is that
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.280]   during the luteal phase,
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.240]   which is the second half of the menstrual cycle,
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.520]   there's been a buildup of the lining of the uterus
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.240]   because of an increase in progesterone.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.400]   So estrogen goes up during the follicular phase,
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.560]   then it goes down,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.480]   and then progesterone goes up, up, up, up, up,
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.800]   which is important for generating that thick lining
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.820]   of the uterus to allow the fertilized egg,
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.080]   if it's fertilized to implant,
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.420]   and if it's not fertilized,
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.920]   all of that gets released from the body
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.800]   in this bleeding process that we call menstruation.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.140]   If menstruation occurs and day one of the menstrual cycle
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.260]   is considered the first day in which bleeding occurs,
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.960]   well, then what that means is that estrogen is already low
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.120]   because remember, estrogen was low
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.280]   at the start of the follicular phase
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.700]   and went up, up, up, up, up, up,
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.760]   then it comes down right at the time of ovulation
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.400]   and progesterone goes up, up, up, up, up
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.880]   during the luteal phase.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.620]   In fact, it's more than 1,000 fold increase in progesterone,
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.920]   but if there's no fertilization of the egg,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   progesterone starts coming down, down, down, down, down.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.760]   What does that mean?
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.700]   That means that on the first
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.180]   to about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle,
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.360]   first being the first day of bleeding
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.160]   till about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle,
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.680]   both estrogen and progesterone are very, very low,
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.440]   and it is at that time,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.420]   at the very beginning of the menstrual cycle,
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.440]   so about the first week of the menstrual cycle,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.680]   that many women are very prone to hormonal headaches.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.840]   Hormonal headaches, not because estrogen's high,
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.340]   that's a common misconception,
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.960]   rather because estrogen and progesterone are both low.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.660]   And now that you understand the contour
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.560]   or the underlying reasons for hormonal headache,
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.820]   you can start to ask,
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.540]   well, what happens when estrogen is low?
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.000]   Well, estrogen has strong impact on the vasodilation,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.520]   vasoconstriction system, as does progesterone.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.900]   We'll talk about that a little bit later,
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.840]   but now that you know what hormonal headache is,
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.000]   at least this one particular type of hormonal headache,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.580]   which is very, very common,
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.360]   given the number of women that are menstruating
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.620]   and the fact that low estrogen, low progesterone
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.960]   is the cause of the hormonal headache,
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.360]   and the fact that, of course,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.120]   there are women who are no longer menstruating,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.700]   so they're either in perimenopause
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.360]   and menstruation is becoming more infrequent
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.240]   or they're in menopause and it has ceased entirely,
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.800]   well, now you understand
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.160]   what the origin of the hormonal headache is,
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.400]   and so all we need to know is
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   what do estrogen and progesterone normally do
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.360]   in order to prevent headache,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.180]   and thereby you'll know exactly how to offset,
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.000]   that is prevent or treat hormonal headache
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.780]   in that first week of the menstrual period.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.700]   The last type of headache that I'd like to discuss
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.140]   is headache associated with head hits,
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.900]   that is traumatic brain injury,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.020]   although I definitely want to underscore the fact that
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.400]   even people who do not have traumatic brain injury
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.480]   can experience headaches
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.580]   as the consequence of hitting their head,
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.300]   so the line between traumatic brain injury
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.260]   and lower level brain injury
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.980]   is one that still seeks definition,
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.640]   and in fact, this is one of the major goals
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.520]   of the clinical field as it relates to concussion,
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.920]   you know, it's also what comes up a lot
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.840]   during the discussion about football,
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.200]   you know, these days you'll see players hit really hard
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.980]   and depending on whether or not they're laying there
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.940]   for five seconds, 30 seconds or three minutes,
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.180]   you know, the crowd and the people watching on television
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.700]   and everywhere else are all speculating
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.660]   as to whether or not the person should be allowed to play
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.220]   and to be quite direct,
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.200]   there really is no way to assess
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.680]   the extent of brain damage
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.700]   after the consequence of hitting one's head
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.660]   or having one's head hit
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.820]   because first of all,
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.480]   almost all of the best ways to detect traumatic brain injury
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.680]   except the most severe ones
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.820]   tend to require a lot of very large equipment
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:46.260]   like MRI and functional MRI and CT scans,
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.860]   none of which are available on the side of the field
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.440]   or in the locker room,
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.460]   but also because many, many,
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.300]   if not most of the effects of traumatic brain injury
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.480]   are going to occur not in the immediate minutes
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.460]   or even hours after the injury,
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.040]   but several hours, days, or even weeks after that injury.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.180]   So this is a discussion that we should hold off
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.600]   for a longer full episode on traumatic brain injury.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.620]   Keeping in mind, of course,
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.640]   that football is this very salient example
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.620]   of traumatic brain injury and concussion
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:18.360]   as is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball,
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.340]   believe it or not repeated low level impact
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.900]   to the forehead and other parts of the head
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.740]   can give rise to over time,
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.540]   traumatic brain injury without the need
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.180]   for any kind of full-blown concussion
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.180]   or being "knocked out."
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.160]   But sports related concussion
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.000]   actually occupies just a tiny fraction
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.400]   of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.600]   Most traumatic brain injury and concussion
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.360]   and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.300]   to become traumatic for sake of daily living,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.860]   that is lowered cognition,
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.280]   disruption in mood, sleep, et cetera,
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.820]   is actually the consequence of things other than sports.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.820]   So for instance, bicycle accidents,
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.780]   playground accidents, construction accidents,
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.180]   and this is often forgotten.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.220]   And for some reason,
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.320]   all the sports and in particular football
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.280]   tend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.300]   Keep in mind that while for certain people
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.780]   is a path to a living,
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.340]   for most people, traumatic brain injury
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.780]   is going to occur in a car accident,
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.460]   construction work or other types of work
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.000]   for which people generally don't have many options
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.420]   in terms of the type of work that they're doing.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.900]   So they are prone to concussions and head injuries
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.900]   simply by virtue of their work
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.200]   without any millions of dollars contracts
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.540]   or the opportunity necessarily,
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.580]   in some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.220]   And certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.500]   are not voluntary events.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.240]   So the point being traumatic brain injury
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.380]   and headache related traumatic brain injury
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.380]   extends far beyond the realm of sports.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.120]   And in fact, if you were to look at the numbers,
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.000]   what you'll find is that
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.280]   more than 90% of traumatic brain injury,
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.940]   so people coming into the hospital or clinic
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.960]   or people claiming that they've got consistent headaches,
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.940]   they're not sleeping well, their mood is off,
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.060]   they're feeling more irritable
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.740]   after having hit their head even once
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.060]   is not the consequence of sports.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.860]   It's going to be the consequence of accidents
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.960]   either at the workplace or in terms of a bicycle
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.980]   or other sorts of transportation based accident
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.080]   like a car accident.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.480]   With that in mind, any kind of head hit,
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.220]   certainly if it involves a concussion
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:19.780]   or traumatic brain injury often leads to headaches,
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.660]   either infrequent but severe headaches
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:24.100]   or chronic low-level headaches
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.580]   or a feeling that there's kind of a stuffiness
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:27.020]   or a fullness to the head.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.620]   There can be a lot of different origins to that.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.340]   A common origin is going to be actual swelling
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.000]   of the, not necessarily the brain tissue directly,
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.100]   but if you recall our discussion about the meninges,
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.500]   which include the dura
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.540]   and the other tissues that surround the brain,
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.780]   there are actually three layers that we call the meninges,
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.100]   the dura just being one of them.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.000]   And there's a very little space between the brain,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.880]   the meninges that surround it and the skull,
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.500]   it's called the subarachnoid space.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.980]   Very cool, right, arachnoid like spider.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.280]   Well, if there's even a slight bit of swelling in the brain
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.620]   or even distant brain tissue.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.000]   So for instance, even if there's whiplash,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.740]   so there's swelling of the tissue, muscular tissue
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.140]   and neural tissue in the neck area,
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.020]   that can constrict the flow of things
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.440]   like cerebral spinal fluid, blood flow,
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.760]   and indeed mucus and other things that are essential.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.880]   We all hear mucus and we think illness,
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.540]   but mucus is a vital, vital substance within the body
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.640]   for a lot of important reasons,
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.680]   in health as well as in sickness.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.540]   Well, if there's less of that liquid and other fluids
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.920]   and mucus being delivered to that space,
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.980]   well, then it can clog up.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:31.320]   So sort of the plumbing is clogged up
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.780]   or that it's caught at the level of the site of hit or injury
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.020]   because there's some local swelling and inflammation there.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.300]   So there are many different mechanisms
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.380]   that can underlie headache associated
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.200]   with head hits or traumatic brain injury.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.540]   Now, fortunately, there's some recent data pointing to
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.540]   some what I would call non-obvious treatments
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.540]   for headache in traumatic brain injury,
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:56.540]   keeping in mind that anytime we're talking about injury
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.200]   or disease or health for that matter,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.580]   mental health or physical health,
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.000]   we have to highlight a fact that's going to come up
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.540]   again and again in every single episode of this podcast.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:11.380]   And I think it's not being overly redundant to do so,
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:16.380]   which is that regular sufficient amounts of deep sleep
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.380]   each night are going to be important for all aspects
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.060]   of mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:23.380]   and have been shown over and over again
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.360]   to reduce the frequency of headache
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.860]   and to reduce the time to repair after traumatic brain injury
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.960]   and can improve cognition and on and on and on.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.540]   So sleep is essential for all the normal things
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:36.380]   that encourage healthy activity of the different tissues
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.620]   that are involved in brain and body to occur.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.980]   So sleep deprivation, of course, is going to limit those.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.660]   But I do want to point out that sleep, sunlight,
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:48.820]   and I've talked about this almost ad nauseum on this podcast,
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.460]   but regular circadian cycles,
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.160]   getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.220]   and in the evening as well and as much as possible
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.820]   throughout the day without burning your skin
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.800]   and limiting your exposure to artificial lights at night
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.440]   and on and on, all of which is covered
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.660]   in the Light for Health episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.000]   the Master Your Sleep episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.820]   and in the Perfect Your Sleep episode
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.120]   You can find all that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.860]   Getting light and avoiding light
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.740]   at the proper times of the 24-hour cycle
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.940]   is also going to favor all the pathways
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.760]   ranging from gut brain access to the inflammatory,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.720]   anti-inflammatory pathways, neural pathways, et cetera,
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.500]   that, of course, if you do that,
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.340]   you're going to improve and offset any kind of detriment
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.940]   caused by traumatic brain injury.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.100]   Is it treating traumatic brain injury directly?
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.420]   No, but is not getting sufficient sleep,
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.160]   not getting sunlight at the right times of day
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.140]   and getting too much artificial light at night
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.740]   going to make any impact of traumatic brain injury,
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.140]   including headache, far worse?
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.940]   Yes, there are certainly a ton of data
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.380]   to support that statement as well.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.100]   And then, of course, nutrition and exercise
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:47.940]   are also important.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.820]   So we can list out sleep, sun, proper nutrition, exercise,
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.980]   and I would put proper social connection,
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.980]   whatever that means to you.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.420]   Healthy social connections include romantic,
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.720]   friendship, familial, and relationship to self.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.000]   Those five things, sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.220]   and social connection are all critical
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.720]   for maintaining baselines of health
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.460]   and raising your baselines of health.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.820]   And I mentioned that, I kind of segment this out now
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.900]   because I think that anytime we're about
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.700]   to start discussing pointed treatments,
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:21.140]   that is things that you can take or do to reduce headache
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.640]   or things that you can take or do to improve anything
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.880]   within mental health, physical health, and performance,
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.980]   we have to remember that the foundation of mental health,
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.820]   physical health, and performance is only set
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.280]   at its highest level by tending to those other things
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.160]   and that nothing really surpasses any of those things.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.620]   Or put differently, there's no replacement
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.940]   for any of those things in the form of a pill,
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.700]   a powder, even a behavioral practice.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.460]   There are things you can do to offset
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.340]   getting less than ideal sleep,
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.980]   the things that you can use like bright artificial lights
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.720]   during the day to try and partially offset lack of sunlight,
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.140]   but really there is no exercise pill.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.740]   There is no sunlight device,
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.580]   although some bright lights are very bright.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.460]   There's no replacement for actual sunlight.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.900]   There's no replacement for actual sleep.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.520]   There's no replacement for actual nutrition.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.540]   And I do feel it's an important conversation to have
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.960]   as we head into the next segment,
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.300]   which is what can you take or do to reduce headache?
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.380]   And in order to address this,
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.660]   we're going to start first with the headaches associated
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.200]   with head hits and traumatic brain injury,
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.320]   because it turns out there's a surprising
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.660]   and very useful approach to doing that.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:26.780]   But this same approach also can help offset
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.900]   and treat headache in other conditions as well,
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.700]   meaning not just for headaches caused
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.680]   by traumatic brain injury,
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.780]   but also headaches caused by sudden onset tension headache
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.860]   or migraine headache, or even perhaps, again,
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.340]   perhaps cluster type headaches.
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.700]   So the first substance that I'd like to highlight
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.440]   that has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.300]   and or frequency of headaches is creatine.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.560]   Now, creatine, as many of you know,
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.800]   is something that people supplement and take.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.220]   Most often, creatine is discussed
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.700]   in the context of muscle performance,
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.900]   not just for people who weight lift,
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.060]   but for people who do endurance exercise.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:06.260]   And it's often been said that five to 10 grams per day
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.200]   of creatine monohydrate, depending on how much you weigh,
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.680]   five to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate,
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.740]   can increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles,
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.080]   can bring more water into muscles,
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080]   can make you stronger, can increase power output.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.560]   And that is all true.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   That is all completely true.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.640]   We discussed this in the Huberman Lab podcast
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.960]   with Dr. Andy Galpin when he was a guest
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.880]   on the Huberman Lab podcast or standard series.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.360]   And we discussed this extensively in an upcoming episode
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.360]   from Dr. Andy Galpin in his special six-part guest series,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.960]   where he is a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.200]   but where really he's the one
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.840]   doing the majority of the teaching.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.000]   That series covers everything
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.420]   from strength, hypertrophy, endurance.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.100]   And there's an episode on supplementation
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.680]   where we go deep into the discussion about creatine.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.240]   Now, in that discussion, and again now,
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.760]   we highlight the fact that creatine,
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.880]   while most often discussed online and in the media
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.360]   as a supplement for sports performance,
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.280]   for the reasons I just mentioned,
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.760]   actually has far more data behind it.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.720]   That is laboratory studies exploring the role of creatine
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.240]   in the clinical setting.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.200]   So I'd like to highlight a paper from that literature now
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.160]   that will make very clear as to why creatine is interesting
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.620]   and in fact, very effective for treating headache,
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.320]   in particular, headache caused by head hits
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.460]   or traumatic brain injury.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.540]   The title of the paper is prevention of traumatic headache,
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.400]   dizziness, and fatigue with creatine administration.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.560]   Now, keep in mind, this is a pilot study.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.880]   It was performed in humans.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.640]   So when you hear the words preclinical,
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.500]   that is if you hear there was a preclinical study on blank,
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.040]   that means almost always that the study was performed
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.640]   on animal models, mice, rats, primates, et cetera.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.040]   A clinical trial is something that's carried out on humans
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.320]   and a pilot study means that the study was carried out
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.760]   on humans, but on a fairly small cohort,
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.480]   a fairly small group or limited number of subjects.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.040]   Nonetheless, if the data are robust,
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.240]   as it is in this case of this paper,
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.960]   I think it's worth paying attention to.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.780]   So in this study,
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.040]   what they looked at was creatine administration.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.240]   So what they did is they had people ingest
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.880]   a certain amount of creatine, I'll tell you in a moment,
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.800]   in fluids, so it could be taken in water or milk
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.720]   with or without food,
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.860]   doesn't really matter what time of day.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.440]   They had people take creatine.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.800]   Why would they have people take creatine
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.780]   after traumatic brain injury?
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.920]   And in particular for people that are suffering
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.620]   from headache, dizziness, fatigue, et cetera.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.000]   The reason is that neurons, nerve cells,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.600]   rely very heavily on the regulation of calcium
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.440]   in order to generate those action potentials
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.660]   to communicate with one another.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.000]   So it doesn't matter if it's a motor neuron,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.680]   a sensory neuron, or a modulatory neuron,
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.040]   they all generate action potentials
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.280]   or something similar to it.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.800]   And calcium is important for that process.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.760]   Calcium becomes dysregulated after traumatic brain injury
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.260]   in a number of different ways.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.880]   In particular, in ways that impact
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.340]   the energy production systems of cells
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.840]   that are related to ATP, adenosine triphosphate
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.040]   for those aficionados out there that want to look it up,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.360]   you can simply look up calcium, ATP, and neurons,
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.720]   and you can learn about that cycle.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.120]   Creatine can be stored in muscles as we talked about before,
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.520]   but creatine, and in particular,
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.440]   the phosphorylated form of creatine,
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   which is the readily available fuel source form of creatine,
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.180]   can also be stored in brain tissue.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.320]   And that is actually quite prominently stored
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.680]   in the forebrain, the area where the real estate
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.240]   of your brain just behind the forehead,
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.640]   which is involved in planning and action
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.960]   and understanding context.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.040]   So it's very important for cognition.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.820]   It's important for personality too,
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.960]   but it's important for a number of different aspects of life
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.320]   that have to do with making plans,
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   being able to focus very intensely on your work, et cetera,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.160]   or on anything for that matter,
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.660]   all functions that become heavily disrupted
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.520]   in people who have traumatic brain injury and concussion.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.480]   Creatine's ability to communicate
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.000]   with the calcium and the ATP system
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.360]   was the motivation behind this study.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.800]   That is the authors hypothesized
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.160]   on the basis of preclinical data in animals
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:52.400]   that by increasing creatine stores within the brain,
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.120]   not just in the muscle, but in particular within the brain,
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.080]   that the availability of creatine would allow
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.560]   for better cognitive function in general.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.280]   Now, they didn't look at cognition specifically
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.980]   in this paper, but they did look at the other aspects,
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.920]   that is that the bad stuff associated with TBI.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.320]   And they had people supplement with creatine
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.280]   at a level that is much higher than the typical level
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.120]   that people supplement with creatine
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.900]   simply for sports performance.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.920]   So as I mentioned before, most people,
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.000]   if they supplement with creatine for sports performance,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.920]   they take creatine monohydrate, typically five grams per day,
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.200]   sometimes 10 grams per day
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.720]   if they're about 100 kilograms or greater in body weight.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.520]   100 kilograms is approximately 220 pounds.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.840]   So the dosage that was used for supplementing creatine
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.320]   in this study to address the potential impact of creatine
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.960]   on headache, dizziness, and fatigue was quite a bit higher
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.760]   than the dosages used simply for muscle performance.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:54.740]   In this study, they had people take a dose of 0.4 grams
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:58.280]   of creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.160]   So for somebody that weighs 100 kilograms or 220 pounds,
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.960]   that would be 40 grams of creatine per day.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.480]   If someone weighs half that much,
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.000]   they would take 20 grams of creatine per day.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.360]   And they did that over a period of six months.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.560]   And we know that when you take creatine over and over,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.060]   day to day, that there's a buildup of creatine stores
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.560]   both in the muscles and within the brain tissue.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.960]   Now, what they found as a consequence
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.220]   of this creatine administration was really striking
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.780]   and I think quite exciting.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.760]   They found a very significant decrease
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.520]   in the frequency of headache
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.620]   in people that were supplementing with creatine
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.340]   as opposed to the controls.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.440]   Now, keep in mind that this is a pilot study,
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.360]   but the effects are very dramatic.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.680]   They found a very statistically significant decrease
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.600]   in the frequency of headache
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.440]   in people that were taking creatine.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.600]   In fact, if you look at the controls and you see
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.100]   that they're basically getting headache at a frequency
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.300]   of 90% or more after TBI,
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.420]   the reduction in headache frequency is down to about 10
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.060]   or 12% in the people taking creatine.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.900]   So that's quite a dramatic effect.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.460]   And if you look at the other measures they took,
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.480]   keep in mind again, this is a pilot study,
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.880]   so a limited number of subjects,
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.560]   but again, the results are very impressive.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.800]   What they found is that the number of people
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.840]   experiencing dizziness was significantly reduced
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.280]   in people supplementing with creatine
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.360]   as was the number of people experiencing fatigue,
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.300]   kind of acute fatigue and chronic fatigue.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.600]   Again, not chronic fatigue syndrome per se,
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.660]   but chronic fatigue, which was in this study defined
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.480]   as a general sense of bodily weakness
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.640]   and even mental weakness.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.000]   Mental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.420]   but they were very careful to distinguish
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.180]   between cognitive and mental fatigue
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.480]   versus physical and somatic fatigue.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.280]   They acknowledged that both of those occur in TBI
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.240]   or post TBI, the headache is quite frequent.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.160]   Basically the takeaway of the study is that
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.400]   for people experiencing headache, dizziness and fatigue
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   due to TBI and perhaps, and I want to underline perhaps
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.880]   because it hasn't really been explored yet,
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.960]   but perhaps headache, dizziness and fatigue
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.960]   due to other conditions, symptoms or causes of headache,
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.240]   creatine monohydrate supplementation might be,
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.060]   again, might be an excellent candidate for people to try.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:08.900]   Why do we say that?
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.260]   Well, first of all,
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.800]   creatine monohydrate is relatively inexpensive.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.140]   It's considered safe at the dosages used in this study
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:20.060]   and certainly for sports performance as well.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:23.900]   And there are very few other compounds
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.500]   that have been shown to have as significant an impact
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:31.080]   on headache over the long-term as has creatine monohydrate
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.300]   in these studies of people with TBI.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.780]   It's also important to highlight the fact that
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.660]   many, many people suffer from TBI as I mentioned earlier.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.200]   And as now there are very few treatments for TBI.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.380]   You tend to get the basic advice coming back.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.300]   And again, I think it's excellent advice,
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.500]   get proper amounts of sleep, get exercise,
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.180]   but don't get another traumatic brain injury.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.300]   That's obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.220]   go right back to work because they have to.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.100]   And we have to be sympathetic to the fact that
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:02.620]   many people just can't stop working or go on disability.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.260]   So many people have to go back to work.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.900]   That could be sport or it could be other kind of work
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.640]   where they are then subject to perhaps getting more TBI.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.040]   Maybe they're getting less rest as a consequence and stress.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.560]   Obviously stress is a confounding issue for TBI,
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.620]   but sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition, all of those things,
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.600]   proper social connection are what people are encouraged to do
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.800]   when they have TBI.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.580]   But there have been very few compounds in particular,
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.420]   very few over-the-counter compounds that are known to be
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:31.480]   safe that have shown efficacy in dealing with TBI.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   So I think that while this is a pilot study
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.440]   and we can consider it preliminary,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.280]   I think it's important enough and the effects were dramatic
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.880]   enough that people with headache and in particular,
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.760]   people with TBI ought to consider supplementing with creatine
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.320]   in order to deal with their headaches.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.160]   And of course, I eagerly await other studies exploring the
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.260]   role of this high dosage of creatine,
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:55.100]   or I should say relatively high dosage of creatine
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.080]   monohydrate for offsetting headache.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.520]   Meanwhile, I think there are a number of people out there
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.000]   suffering from headache who might consider using
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.800]   creatine monohydrate in an exploratory fashion
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.960]   and seeing whether it helps offset their headaches.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.000]   Keep in mind, of course,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.400]   anytime you're going to add or remove anything,
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.840]   supplement or otherwise from your treatment,
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.760]   your nutrition, et cetera,
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.960]   I do suggest that you consult with your physician,
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.800]   in particular, if you have chronic headaches.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.960]   I don't say that to protect me.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.080]   I say that of course, to protect you.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.720]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.800]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.280]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.800]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.440]   to help you better understand your body
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.280]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.920]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.360]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.360]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.960]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.020]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.560]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.080]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.840]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.640]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.960]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.800]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.960]   you might want to take on
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.560]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.340]   hormones, lipids, and other things
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.300]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.320]   to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.000]   and indeed optimal for you.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.040]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.320]   also now includes a measure of apolipoprotein B.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.740]   Apolipoprotein B, sometimes also called ApoB,
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.900]   has emerged in recent years
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.280]   as among the most important measures
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.360]   to evaluate your overall levels of cardiovascular health
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.920]   and health overall.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.760]   And that's because apolipoprotein B levels
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.940]   are predictive of cardiovascular function, disease,
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:42.760]   and things that cardiovascular function and disease
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.820]   can impinge on, including brain health and longevity.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.220]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.760]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.860]   What I'd like to discuss next, I find extremely exciting.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.720]   Why?
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.340]   Well, what I'm about to describe is a compound,
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.120]   or I should say a set of compounds,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.440]   that are available over the counter
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.000]   that have been shown to be very effective
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.480]   in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches,
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.800]   and not just one kind of headache,
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.400]   but multiple types of headaches.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.320]   So what I'll describe has been shown
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.920]   to have significant effects in reducing the intensity
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.220]   or frequency of tension-type headaches,
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:26.560]   migraine-type headaches, as well as hormone-type headaches
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.240]   that are related to the menstrual cycles
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.420]   that I described earlier.
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.760]   Now, there are a lot of data
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.960]   centered around this general topic,
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.480]   but I'm going to focus on three main papers.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.040]   What I haven't told you yet, of course,
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.740]   is what is the compound that I'm referring to?
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.800]   What is this over-the-counter compound?
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.060]   Well, it turns out this over-the-counter compound
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.760]   is not just available over the counter,
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.880]   it's also available in food.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.080]   So it turns out that nutrition can have a very strong impact
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.200]   on the frequency and intensity of headache,
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.840]   although supplementation with this particular compound
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.720]   can accomplish the same thing as well.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.320]   What I'm referring to here are omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.720]   Many of you are probably familiar with omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.160]   These are fatty acids that come in the form
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.520]   of so-called EPA and DHA,
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.320]   and omega-3 fatty acids are commonly distinguished
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.400]   from the so-called omega-6 fatty acids.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.920]   Omega-6 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods,
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.880]   and they, of course, can be supplemented as well.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.000]   Omega-3 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.560]   and can be supplemented as well.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.800]   Common forms of omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.720]   or I should say common sources of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.720]   in foods include fatty ocean fish,
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.020]   including salmon, salmon skins, sardines, anchovies,
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.680]   things of that sort.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.960]   Common sources in supplement form are so-called fish oil,
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.920]   capsules, or liquid fish oil.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.640]   Again, omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.640]   and almost always when we're talking
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.000]   about omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.640]   we're talking about a combination of EPA and DHA,
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.640]   but really it is the quantity of EPA omega-3 fatty acids
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.400]   that seems to be the most impactful
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.720]   for the sorts of health metrics
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.160]   that we're going to talk about in a few minutes.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.440]   Now, with respect to omega-6 fatty acids,
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.120]   the most typical food sources of omega-6 fatty acids
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.300]   are seed oils.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.040]   I know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.820]   I've given my stance on this in a prior podcast,
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.660]   but I'll just repeat it
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.060]   for those of you that haven't heard it.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.320]   I am not of the belief that all seed oils are bad,
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.020]   that they're all inflammatory,
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.360]   that they are killing us or making us sick,
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.600]   that they are the major cause
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.080]   of metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.980]   However, I think it is very clear,
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.480]   and I learned this from Dr. Lay Norton
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.920]   when he was a guest on this podcast
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.200]   and taught us all about nutrition in great depth.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.420]   I highly recommend that episode
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.960]   if you're interested in nutrition,
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.360]   that people are consuming a lot more oil generally,
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.660]   and a lot of those oils
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.400]   that people are consuming more of nowadays
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.800]   include a lot of the so-called omega-6 fatty acids,
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.940]   and a lot of those oils are seed oils.
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.720]   The particular omega-6 fatty acid
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.520]   that's going to be relevant for today's discussion
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.240]   is linoleic acid,
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.440]   and that is common in a lot of seed oils.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.700]   So again, I'm not going to tell you that seed oils are bad.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.400]   However, it does seem to be the case
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.000]   that many people are consuming far too many seed oils,
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.420]   and in doing so are consuming far too many calories,
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.840]   and perhaps are consuming too much of the omega-6 fatty acids
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.000]   relative to the omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.840]   Now, with that said,
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.400]   I think there is general agreement
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.480]   among nutritionists and health professionals
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.760]   that we could all stand to get more omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.280]   perhaps for cardiovascular health,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.640]   although that's a little bit debated,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.440]   but certainly for immune system function,
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.360]   for mood, and for functioning of the brain,
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.600]   and for the potent anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.240]   So again, omega-3s can be sourced from food,
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.640]   both animal-based and plant-based.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.800]   You can simply go online
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.080]   and look up the various food-based sources,
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.860]   but in thinking about headache
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.000]   and different treatments for headache,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.680]   there are some recent studies exploring
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.240]   how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.320]   and in one case, how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.840]   and deliberately reducing the amount of linoleic acid,
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.200]   the omega-6 fatty acids, how that can impact headache.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.680]   So the first study I'd like to describe
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.840]   in reference to the role of omega-3 fatty acids in headache
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.620]   was published in 2018,
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.800]   and the title of the paper is
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.280]   Long Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Headache
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.600]   in the US Population.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.440]   There are a number of things
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.960]   that I really like about this study.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.520]   A few of those include the fact
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.880]   that they looked at an enormous number of people.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.520]   That is, they included 12,317 men and women.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.140]   I like the fact that they included men and women
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.320]   in the study, age 20 or older,
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.440]   and that they broke down the population
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.600]   into categories that included age.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.040]   They certainly looked at race and ethnicity.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.100]   They looked at educational background.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.600]   They looked at body mass, total energy intake,
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.600]   which is really important.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.040]   If you think about it, people are going to be eating,
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.120]   and within the things that they eat,
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.320]   they're going to be consuming some omega-3s, hopefully,
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.880]   as well as some omega-6s,
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.960]   and if they're eating far more,
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.560]   then they're likely going to get far more
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.440]   of both of those things than they would ordinarily
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.840]   if they were eating smaller amounts.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.240]   So they controlled for total caloric intake
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.680]   in a way that I find particularly useful
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.240]   for looking at these kind of data.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.860]   So the reason they explored omega-3s is worth mentioning.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.800]   Omega-3 fatty acids are known to have
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.720]   an anti-inflammatory effect.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.800]   That anti-inflammatory effect is mediated
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.040]   through a couple of different pathways.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.220]   We won't go into these in too much detail now,
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.940]   but the omega-3 fatty acids, keep in mind,
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.900]   actually make up various parts of cells
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.140]   in the brain and body.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.100]   That's right, the membrane that,
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.960]   remember I talked before about how steroid hormones
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.600]   can go through the different membranes of the cells,
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.400]   the outer membrane and the inner membrane.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.920]   A lot of those actual membranes,
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.420]   the structural constituents of neurons and other cells
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.880]   are actually made up of or include certain fatty acid,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.160]   long-chain fatty acids,
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.280]   and the omega-3 fatty acids are important
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.900]   for the actual construction of those tissues,
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.520]   as well as having anti-inflammatory effects
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.480]   through things like limiting prostaglandins
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.280]   and other things that can cause inflammation.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.560]   Okay, so there are a bunch of different ways
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.000]   that omega-3 fatty acids can be useful.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   They refer in this study to an earlier study
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.940]   that looked at the so-called analgesic effect,
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.280]   the pain relieving effect.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.300]   Analgesic means pain relieving effect
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.500]   of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.720]   in what had been a randomized control trial.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.240]   And in that previous paper,
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.880]   what they found was that diets high in omega-3s
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.080]   and low in omega-6s, okay, so high three, low six,
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.080]   and as compared to diets that were just reduced omega-6s,
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.360]   they found a greater analgesic effect
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.740]   of increasing omega-3s
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:33.040]   while also reducing omega-6 fatty acids.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.380]   So in the context of the seed oil discussion,
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.900]   although keeping in mind that omega-6s
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.960]   can come from other sources as well,
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.540]   if omega-6s were just reduced on their own,
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.040]   there wasn't as great an effect
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.040]   in terms of reducing pain and inflammation
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.780]   as there was when omega-3 fatty acids
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.980]   were deliberately increased
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.360]   and omega-6 fatty acids were reduced.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.880]   Again, in all of these studies,
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.840]   because these are the ones
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.480]   in which they controlled things well, as we say,
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.220]   they are holding constant the caloric intake.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.500]   So it's not just that you're removing fat, eating less fat,
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.480]   there's actually a removal of certain fats and fatty acids
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.440]   and a replacement of those with omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.800]   In one case, in the other case,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.000]   it's just a reduction in omega-6s
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.440]   and you're using other food types and macronutrients
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.840]   to offset that reduction in calories
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.680]   caused by reducing omega-6s.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.860]   The basic takeaway that they're relying on
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:23.840]   marching into the study
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.280]   is that increasing omega-3s and reducing omega-6s
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.240]   seems to be beneficial for reducing pain.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.560]   And indeed in this study, they find something quite similar,
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.000]   which is that when you hold caloric intake constant
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.360]   and when you look at omega-6s,
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.520]   whether or not you decrease omega-6 fatty acids or not,
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   you find is that increasing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet,
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.360]   so either consumed through food sources or by supplementation
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.200]   was associated with a lower prevalence
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.120]   of severe headache or migraine.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.960]   So severe tension type headache or migraine.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.200]   So this is promising and points to the fact
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.480]   that long chain omega-3 fatty acids
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.720]   are likely to have either a pain reducing,
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.280]   and there's evidence for that,
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.280]   and/or an inflammation reducing effect
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.400]   that can significantly reduce the severity of headache
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.920]   in both tension type headache and in migraine.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.200]   So that's the first study.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.840]   The second study is a more recent study,
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.680]   it was published in 2021,
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.400]   that used a, I would say a more or less similar type
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.000]   of overall design as the one I referred to earlier.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.520]   The title of this paper is dietary alteration
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.260]   of what they call N3, but those are omega-3 and N6,
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.480]   omega-6, sorry for the shift in nomenclature,
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.140]   I didn't write the paper.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:42.020]   Dietary alteration of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.200]   for headache reductions in adults with migraine,
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.700]   and this was a randomized control trial.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.500]   Randomized control trials involve having people
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.700]   be in one condition where they do one thing
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.620]   and then they get swapped randomly into another condition,
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.780]   so they serve as their own internal control,
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.800]   and that controls for all sorts of things
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.860]   like differences in sex, differences in age,
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:02.560]   differences in health background,
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.040]   and any number of other variables as best as one can.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.200]   In this study, they had people either ingest a diet
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:14.200]   that had increased omega-3s, so increased EPA and DHA,
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.520]   or increased EPA and DHA
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:21.420]   and reduced amounts of linoleic acid, okay,
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.280]   so that's going to reduce omega-6s,
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.300]   or a control diet in which they had people taking
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.260]   what's essentially the average intake
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.060]   of omega-3s and omega-6s,
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.540]   and you can probably already guess
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.120]   what the general results of this study are going to be.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.460]   The general results were that there were reductions
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:40.020]   in headaches, okay?
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.960]   The really cool thing is it was a massive reduction
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:43.800]   in headache, okay?
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.500]   This was, they referred to it as a robust reduction
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.440]   in headache in particular for the subjects
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.020]   that increased their omega-3s
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.600]   and reduced the amount of linoleic acid that they took.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.620]   The other thing that I really like about this study
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.260]   is that while they don't know the exact underlying mechanism
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:02.900]   for the effect, they did spend some time delineating
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.900]   what it is that the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.140]   are likely doing to either offset or exacerbate headache.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.180]   Now, I didn't say that omega-6 fatty acids
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.800]   exacerbate headache, but it does seem that people
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.780]   who ingest more linoleic acid and omega-6
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.140]   are experiencing more inflammation,
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.540]   and that is evident in a bunch of different conditions.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.900]   One, for instance, is increases in things like CGRP.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:28.220]   CGRP is a molecule that's associated
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.540]   with a calcium signaling pathway.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.380]   It's involved in vasodilation,
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.700]   the expansion of the blood vessels and capillaries,
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.700]   and that's known, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.520]   to exacerbate certain forms of headache, okay?
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.700]   There are also forms of headache
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.220]   that can be caused by vasoconstriction.
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.980]   We'll talk about one very dramatic example,
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.700]   perhaps, as we get toward the end.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.280]   It's a very uncommon example,
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.180]   but it's called thunderclap headache,
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.960]   and trust me, you do not want a thunderclap headache,
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.580]   and so we'll talk about thunderclap headache
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:55.420]   a little bit later.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.020]   That involves constriction of the blood vessels.
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:59.700]   In any case, in this paper,
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.920]   they didn't study mechanism directly,
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.780]   but they're resting on this known analgesic, anti-pain,
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.100]   as well as known anti-inflammatory pathways
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.160]   related to increasing omega-3 intake,
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.340]   and simultaneously resting on the idea,
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.380]   or I think we now can say conclusion,
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:21.860]   that omega-6 fatty acids, in particular linoleic acid,
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.720]   can increase inflammation by way of increasing things
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.060]   like CGRP, vasodilation, and some other pathways
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:32.340]   related to the so-called inflammatory cytokine pathways,
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.220]   and there's a whole discussion nowadays
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.820]   of what's called the inflammatome.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.100]   So the basic takeaway is that
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.620]   if you are interested in reducing headache,
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.960]   it may be beneficial,
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.580]   at least according to these two studies,
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.460]   and another one I'll talk about in a moment,
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.080]   to increase amounts of omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:48.920]   and that can be done, again,
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.860]   through the ingestions of foods,
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.180]   although based on the dosages
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.320]   that we'll talk about in a moment,
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.860]   increasing omega-3 fatty acids
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.500]   by taking liquid-form fish oil,
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.060]   which is perhaps the most cost-effective way
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.700]   to supplement omega-3s,
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.480]   or capsules, which is perhaps the most efficient way
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.060]   to supplement omega-3s,
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:11.460]   really to a level of one gram or more of EPA per day.
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.100]   Again, that's the EPA form in particular.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.720]   So if you're, for instance, taking supplemental fish oil,
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.460]   or you're getting your omega-3s from food,
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:22.960]   and you're getting what you determine to be 2,000 milligrams
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.660]   or two grams per day of omega-3s,
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.720]   keep in mind that's going to include EPA and DHA,
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.940]   and it does seem that getting above one gram per day
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.100]   of EPA omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.620]   either through food or supplements or both,
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.580]   is going to be the critical threshold for reductions
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.540]   in the frequency and intensity of headaches
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:44.920]   that include both tension headaches and migraine headaches.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.620]   Now, some people will find, actually,
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:50.260]   that ingesting far more omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.600]   generally through supplementation,
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.480]   but again, can be accomplished through foods as well,
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.580]   can also be beneficial for other things, such as mood,
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.800]   and indeed, there's a whole literature
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.860]   related to effects of ingesting one to three grams,
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.620]   again, three grams per day of EPA,
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.660]   so that's going to require quite a high intake
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.940]   of omega-3s in whatever form or supplement
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.020]   you decide to take those into your body,
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.380]   but that can improve mood and so forth.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.960]   The basic range that I was able to find in the meta-analyses,
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.000]   so meta-analyses are where a researcher
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.500]   will look at the results of a bunch of different studies
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.980]   focused on the same thing,
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.540]   look at the different strength of those studies,
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:30.320]   they'll do all sorts of cool statistical gymnastics,
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.540]   like remove the most potent study,
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.160]   the one that had the greatest effect,
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.840]   and see whether or not there's still an effect
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.060]   of some treatment, or for instance,
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:41.220]   they will swap in and out different studies
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.140]   and different combinations to see whether or not
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.460]   any one study is really leading to the conclusion
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.140]   that a given treatment does something.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:50.200]   In any case, in the meta-analyses of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.100]   for the treatment of headache,
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.740]   and that includes all the different kinds of headache,
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:56.820]   what they found in exploring a huge range
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:59.780]   of omega-3 supplementation ranging from 200 milligrams
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:02.140]   all the way up to 2,000 milligrams per day,
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:06.760]   it really was at the one gram or higher dosage per day
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.060]   where the significant impact in reducing headache frequency
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.320]   and intensity was found.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.780]   And just very briefly, earlier I mentioned
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.540]   that not only has omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:18.420]   been shown to be effective in reducing
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.460]   the frequency and intensity of headache,
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.000]   in tension type and migraine type headache,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.240]   but it's also been shown to improve outcomes
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.000]   for premenstrual syndrome related headaches.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.740]   These are what we referred to earlier
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.420]   as hormone-based headaches.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:36.860]   Again, the low estrogen, low progesterone associated
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.580]   with certain phases of the menstrual cycle
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.500]   as well as other phases of the menstrual cycle
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.020]   are often associated with headache.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:45.720]   In a study entitled "Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.820]   on Premenstrual Syndrome, a Systematic Review"
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:50.480]   and again, meta-analysis, what they found,
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.260]   and here I'm paraphrasing the conclusion,
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.740]   was that omega-3 fatty acids could, yes,
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:59.480]   effectively reduce the severity of PMS symptoms.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.160]   And one of the symptoms in particular
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.720]   that they found that was reduced
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.340]   was the pain-related symptoms associated with headache.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.260]   And they actually had some very nice hypotheses
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:11.240]   as to why that likely would be.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.300]   And in fact, point out that in earlier studies,
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.840]   omega-3 fatty acids have actually been considered
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.620]   as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.040]   And indeed there are prescription forms
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.680]   of omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.440]   And I highlight that not because I think people need
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.320]   to run out and get the prescription form
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.520]   of omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.060]   They're actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive.
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.540]   But because I think oftentimes when we're talking
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.640]   about something like omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.620]   the fact that they are available over the counter
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.340]   in a supplement or by liquid or available in food
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:45.900]   for that matter, leads many people to conclude that,
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.640]   oh, this is supplementation.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:51.380]   This is something that it's going to have relatively weak
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.300]   or minor impact on things like headache
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.660]   or other health metrics.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:58.340]   But let's just say that the fact that it exists
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:01.580]   as a prescription drug in its highest potency form,
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:04.980]   at least in my opinion, points to the potency
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:09.620]   of omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with analgesic effects,
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:12.060]   that is reducing pain and anti-inflammation,
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.660]   as well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.220]   that are associated with increasing
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.080]   omega-3 fatty acid intake.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.640]   Put simply, omega-3s are not just something
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.800]   that comes from food or supplements,
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.140]   they are also being marketed as prescription drugs.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:26.800]   So I do think they need to be considered as quite potent.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.440]   And at least as far as these papers that, again,
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.100]   include meta-analyses of many other papers and datasets,
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.820]   indicate that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.100]   to a point where you're getting above one gram per day
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.360]   of EPA is not just going to be beneficial for treating
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.540]   and reducing the frequency and intensity
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.440]   of one particular type of headache,
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.280]   but many types of headaches.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.920]   And when you combine hormonal headaches,
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.660]   tension headaches, and migraine headaches,
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.540]   you account for more than 70% of the total types of headaches
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:56.840]   that are out there.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.920]   The effects of omega-3s on cluster headaches
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.200]   and some of the other types of headaches,
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.040]   at least to my knowledge, have not been evaluated.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.900]   There's no reason to think that omega-3s
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.720]   would not be beneficial for those types of headaches.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.200]   But at least as far as the datasets we talked about here
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.140]   are concerned, it is clear omega-3 fatty acids
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.240]   are going to be a very potent way to reduce pain
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.180]   and to reduce inflammation in ways
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:23.560]   that can reduce the frequency and the intensity
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.760]   of different kinds of headache.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.400]   Before we continue our discussion
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.320]   about many not commonly known and yet very potent treatments
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.840]   for different forms of headache,
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.680]   I want to touch on a topic we mentioned
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.000]   a little bit earlier and also provide a treatment
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.240]   that is a way to alleviate something,
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.720]   and that's photophobia and aura.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.120]   Now, keep in mind that earlier I referred to aura
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.920]   as this sense that something's about to happen.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:50.880]   That is true, meaning that is an accurate description of aura
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.200]   but oftentimes people also come to understand aura
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.560]   as the feeling that something surrounds
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:00.220]   a given object visually or even that people have a sense
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.860]   that something's around them.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:03.840]   So again, this can be a little bit vague,
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.320]   but this idea that aura is a sense of something
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.480]   about to happen or that visually or in an auditory way
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.900]   and or maybe even in kind of a sense
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:15.960]   that something is about to happen in a certain environment.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:18.680]   And the reason I'm making kind of arc shapes with my hands,
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.640]   for those of you that are just listening,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.320]   I'm making arc shapes with my hands,
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.320]   is that aura is often described as kind of a halo
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   or a emanating out from one's body
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.720]   or from something that they're looking at.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.200]   Again, nothing spiritual about this
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.200]   in the context of the discussion about migraine and headache,
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.800]   but rather many people experience photophobia
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.240]   sometimes with aura, sometimes no.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.560]   And I just want to touch on a couple of the mechanisms
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.580]   by which aura and photophobia occur
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:48.360]   and mention just briefly a pretty well-established way
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.600]   that people can start to offset photophobia.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.520]   And again, I mentioned that
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.180]   because many people experience photophobia in headache,
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.480]   but there are also a number of people
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.840]   that experience photophobia
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.640]   even if they don't have intense headache.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.800]   So photophobia is pretty common, pretty debilitating.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.360]   It actually is one of the reasons why people feel not well
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.840]   and need to leave work or not go to school or leave school,
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.480]   these kinds of things or lay in bed all day
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.820]   or dim the lights, not go outside.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:17.220]   Again, sunlight being so congruent with health,
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.760]   you can imagine how photophobia can lead
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.620]   to all sorts of negative downstream consequences.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.560]   Okay, so what is aura and what is photophobia?
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.680]   The exact origins of aura aren't exactly clear,
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.440]   but it is generally thought that what aura represents
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.480]   is what's called spreading depression.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.720]   And this is not depression of one's mood,
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.320]   although it can be associated with that.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.040]   This is depression of neuronal activity.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.880]   Again, neurons communicate with one another
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.720]   by generating electrical impulses
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.040]   that travel down the length of their so-called axons,
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.160]   which are like little wires,
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.280]   and then they dump neurotransmitter out
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.240]   at the so-called synapse
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.760]   and impact the electrical activity of other neurons.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.280]   Depression is a electrical,
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.920]   or I should say a chemoelectrical,
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.240]   chemoelectrical is the proper term,
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.280]   phenomenon in which the excitability of neurons is reduced.
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.120]   So again, doesn't have anything to do with depression
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.320]   as a mood state per se,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.100]   rather it is a reduced excitability of neurons.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:20.600]   And it's been shown in some imaging studies
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.420]   that aura is associated with a back to front.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.280]   So from the back of the brain to front,
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.320]   spreading depression like a wave
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.560]   of lowering levels of electrical excitability.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.920]   And because this originates in the visual cortex,
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:35.760]   which is in the back,
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.920]   so that's the part of your brain
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.640]   that is making sense of visual images
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.800]   coming in through the eyes
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.680]   and relayed through other stations in the brain,
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.780]   that people will start to see a kind of halo of light
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.140]   or that they'll start to feel that the light around them
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.140]   is literally surrounding their body
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.120]   or some other object or body that they're looking at.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.760]   And then it spreads forward in the brain.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.840]   And that's when it tends to stretch over
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.500]   into other so-called sensory modalities.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:06.160]   Sensory modalities being things like touch or hearing.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.380]   So people will get the sense
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:08.960]   that they're kind of seeing something
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.880]   in their periphery of their vision.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.740]   Then they'll start feeling something around them.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.820]   There's a sense that something's about to happen.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.600]   So as this spreading wave of depression
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.820]   goes from back to front,
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.760]   people experience a number of these different
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.660]   semi-abstract sensory phenomena that we call aura.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.380]   Okay, so that's how aura originates.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.860]   Now, photophobia is a little bit different.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.100]   Photophobia, we now understand
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.460]   because of some beautiful work that was done
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.740]   at Cliff Saper's lab at Harvard Medical School
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.780]   and some other laboratories,
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.980]   showing that photophobia originates
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:42.860]   from a specific set of neurons in the eye.
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:44.900]   We call these the intrinsically photosensitive
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.220]   melanopsin ganglion cells,
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.860]   which is really just a mouthful of nerd speak
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.140]   for neurons in the eye that connect to the brain,
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.280]   these so-called ganglion cells,
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:59.080]   that respond most robustly to bright blue light
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.760]   or other short wavelength light.
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.340]   So you've got short wavelength light
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:05.400]   that is blue and greens are short wavelengths,
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.560]   and then long wavelength light, which is red,
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.520]   or it can even be out past where it will be infrared.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.040]   We don't detect infrared consciously.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.820]   Other species do, like pit vipers can see in the infrared.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:16.500]   They can even heat sense.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.400]   So short wavelength light is going to be light
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.200]   that's bright blue, green.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.500]   It's what's very common in fluorescent bulbs
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:27.580]   that are commonly used in household lighting
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.080]   and workplace lighting
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.540]   and other forms of artificial lighting.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:32.900]   It's also, of course, present in sunlight.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.220]   Sunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths,
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.500]   including long wavelength light, of course.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.580]   You've seen that as the reds and oranges
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.780]   in the sunset and so on.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:45.100]   Those intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:49.140]   in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light,
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:51.720]   and they send connections to a bunch of different places
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.920]   in the brain, including the so-called
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.100]   central circadian clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.600]   that sets your day, night, sleep, wake rhythms.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.500]   This is why I encourage people to view sunlight
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.520]   in the morning to set the system in motion
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.620]   to avoid bright light exposure at night
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:09.660]   from artificial sources in order to not send wake up signals
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.420]   from the eye to the brain and then onto the rest of the body
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.540]   but these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.540]   are also known to connect with other areas of the brain,
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.540]   many other areas of the brain, in fact,
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.220]   and one of the important areas of the brain they connect to
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.860]   as it relates to photophobia
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.180]   is an area of a structure called the thalamus.
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.620]   The thalamus is an egg-like structure
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.100]   that sits in the center of the brain,
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:32.540]   and it serves as a kind of a switchboard,
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:35.700]   like a sensory relay by which information
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.700]   coming from the eyes, from the ears,
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:38.980]   from the touch system, et cetera,
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:41.180]   are funneled into different compartments in the thalamus
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.560]   and then sent to different other areas of the brain.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.260]   So think of it kind of like an old fashioned switchboard,
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:50.420]   or you could think of it sort of like in an airport,
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:53.980]   you go to a particular wing of the airport,
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.860]   then you go to a particular gate and so on,
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.380]   you're getting funneled progressively
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.100]   through narrower and narrower channels
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.300]   until you arrive at your particular plane.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:03.140]   Much in the same way,
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.060]   the thalamus has a bunch of different entry points,
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.140]   so it's sensory information
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.780]   coming in from a bunch of different sources,
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.380]   and those sources get routed
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:13.300]   into progressively narrower and narrower funnels
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:15.860]   to eventually arrive at the accurate place
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:17.040]   for their function.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.060]   So these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:22.720]   send connections to a small but important area
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.580]   of the thalamus called LP.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:26.900]   It's denoted L, the letter, and P,
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.180]   with lateral posterior thalamus,
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:33.060]   or I should say it's the lateral posterior nucleus
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.460]   of the thalamus for you ufascinados out there.
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:38.620]   And then the neurons in that location are going to respond,
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:40.060]   that is, they're going to be activated
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.420]   by bright blue light, green light,
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.580]   or any kind of bright light
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:47.100]   originating from artificial sources or from sunlight.
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.400]   And the neurons there that respond to that
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.220]   have a very interesting pattern of connections.
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:55.440]   They send connections up to the so-called sensory cortex,
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.020]   so a bunch of different layers throughout the cortex
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.380]   that are not associated with visual perception,
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:03.140]   that is, they're not associated with understanding
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.980]   that there are shapes and contours in the environment,
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:07.900]   but rather to neurons that are involved
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.480]   in the detection of pressure, pain,
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.840]   and other forms of sensory information
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.560]   at the level of what?
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.500]   The meninges.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.220]   And we talked about the meninges earlier.
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:19.980]   So again, while the brain itself
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:24.980]   does not have a sensory system to detect pain,
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:27.700]   the tissues around it do,
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.660]   and the tissues around those tissues,
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:32.900]   that is the stuff around the meninges,
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.260]   themselves can respond to pain,
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:37.260]   and intracranial pressure is also relayed
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.940]   through the meninges to our conscious awareness
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:40.760]   that there's pain.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:41.920]   So what does this mean for photophobia?
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.780]   It means that bright blue light and green light,
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.020]   and of course, light from sunlight,
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:49.940]   will activate these neurons in the eye,
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.820]   these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.260]   which then activate the lateral posterior neurons,
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:56.680]   LP neurons, and those LP neurons communicate
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.660]   with areas of the brain that are specifically tuned
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:04.100]   to different sensory phenomenon and in particular pain
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.420]   at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:11.060]   What this means is that when we have headache,
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.700]   or if we simply have photophobia on its own,
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:16.380]   that bright light is actually the trigger
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:19.820]   for pain sensing and even the creation of pain
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.460]   at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure.
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.380]   What does this mean in terms of dealing with
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.600]   or treating photophobia?
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.560]   Well, most people deal with photophobia
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.820]   by deciding to turn off or dim all the lights
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.320]   and simply getting under the covers
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.220]   or wearing a very low brimmed hat and putting on sunglasses,
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.580]   and they want to lie down,
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:40.780]   and sometimes because migraine can be associated with nausea
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:44.400]   or even vomiting in severe instances rather.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.180]   But one very simple way to avoid activation
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.480]   of these retinal ganglion cells
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.140]   that would trigger photophobia is that
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:54.020]   if you are starting to feel like you have a migraine
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:56.240]   coming on or you have photophobia coming on,
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:58.140]   to shift to using patterns of light
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:01.080]   that are in the longer wavelength domain.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:06.080]   What that means practically is shifting to using very orange,
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.480]   ideally dim, but very orange and a red light.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.360]   Now, this is not a call for people to go out
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   and invest in expensive red light therapies.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.160]   Admittedly, there are some excellent case uses
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.560]   for red light therapy,
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.620]   particularly for acne, wound healing,
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.280]   even for improving vision,
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.160]   especially in people beyond the age of 40,
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.600]   for some hormone augmentation.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.360]   We talked all about that in the episode
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.940]   that I did on light and health.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:32.000]   Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com,
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.600]   everything timestamped.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.720]   What I'm talking about here would be simply
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:38.580]   having some red light bulbs on hand
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.960]   for any time that you need to remain awake,
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.000]   but you're starting to experience photophobia.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.080]   These red light bulbs can be purchased very inexpensively
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.760]   as party lights.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760]   You can buy these online.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.360]   So there is no specific need to get any,
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:55.980]   I would say, red light that's designed specifically
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.520]   for photophobia or anything of that sort.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:01.740]   You can find the cheapest red light available out there,
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:03.680]   and those will simply work.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.200]   The idea being that for many people
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.960]   who are experiencing photophobia,
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:09.160]   they want to reduce that feeling of pain and pressure
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.760]   in their head experienced through photophobia.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.960]   They also might want to stay awake,
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.080]   get some work done and do things.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.080]   So operating under red light,
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.400]   or I should say living, working, et cetera,
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.120]   under red light would allow you to stay awake,
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.440]   not have to hide under the covers
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.140]   if you're experiencing photophobia.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:23.360]   In addition, and I mentioned this
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.440]   at the beginning of the episode,
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:28.560]   but many people find photophobia to be a entry point
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.720]   or a trigger to headache.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.620]   So what happens is they start to experience some aura,
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:37.140]   some onset of photophobia, and then the photophobia itself
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.560]   leads to this feeling of malaise
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.380]   that then converts into headache.
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:42.380]   And so while there are not a lot of clinical data
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.060]   on this just yet, an emerging idea
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.620]   in the realm of headache treatment
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:49.540]   is the idea that if you can offset some of the early signs,
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:53.280]   you can offset some of that photophobia and aura,
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.340]   perhaps to the use of dim red lights
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:58.020]   or red lights as I've described a moment ago,
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:00.340]   then you might be able to reduce the probability
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.800]   that you're going to have a migraine
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.720]   or other type of headache entirely.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.040]   So again, no need for expensive red lights,
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:09.000]   but you can find red lights very easily online
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.980]   and simply have them on hand or replace the current lights
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:13.080]   that you have on your nightstand
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.780]   or in whatever room you happen to be in
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.040]   with these red lights.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.500]   These red lights are also, I should mention,
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.760]   very useful in limiting the amount of cortisol,
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.120]   a stress hormone that is very healthy for us
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.680]   to release at high levels early in the day.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.600]   In fact, viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.640]   That's another reason why what I'm about to say
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:30.880]   is relevant to photophobia.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.380]   But if you want to keep cortisol levels low
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.440]   in the evening and at night,
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:37.160]   and indeed you do and improve the transition to sleep
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.960]   and indeed your sleep overall,
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.880]   reducing cortisol at evening time and at nighttime
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:43.280]   is extremely beneficial,
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.040]   and red lights will help you accomplish that.
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.240]   I talked about that in the episode on light and health.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.120]   So the point here is that if you suffer from photophobia
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.960]   with or without aura,
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.040]   using red lights and not simply dimming
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.200]   ordinary artificial lights
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.840]   or feeling that you have to turn off all lights entirely
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.680]   is going to be one relatively inexpensive,
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.720]   or I should say very inexpensive in some cases
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.200]   because these red lights can be found
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.020]   very inexpensively online,
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:10.920]   way to be able to continue with your daily activities,
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.980]   at least in an indoor environment
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.840]   if you are suffering from photophobia.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.480]   So shifting back to ways to reduce the intensity
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.240]   and frequency of different kinds of headaches,
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.400]   we haven't talked so much about tension headaches
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.100]   specifically, so that's what I'd like to do now.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:25.640]   As you recall, tension headaches
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.960]   are going to be muscular in origin.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.780]   Again, keeping in mind that everything's neural
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.960]   when it comes to pain,
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.600]   everything's neural when it comes to everything, frankly,
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.800]   'cause every organ and tissue system in our body
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.880]   is ultimately controlled by our nervous system,
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:40.240]   but tension headaches are often associated
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:43.880]   with tension of the muscles that are on the skull,
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.200]   of the jaw, of the neck,
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:49.720]   and can be quite painful for many people and debilitating.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.340]   And the most common treatment for this
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:53.280]   that most people rely on that is,
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.400]   is to take non-steroid anti-inflammatory.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.160]   So things like acetaminophen, ibuprofen,
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.240]   sometimes aspirin and things of that sort.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.320]   And oftentimes those can be helpful.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.320]   There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.960]   The NSAIDs, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.880]   oftentimes will work very well at first,
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.200]   but people quickly develop a tolerance to them,
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.720]   meaning they're going to have to take more and more
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.000]   in order to get the same effect.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.480]   And oftentimes they can't take more and more
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.240]   because some of them are very hard on the liver.
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.520]   And in addition to that,
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.400]   some of them can offset some other things
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:27.240]   that you really want.
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.520]   So for instance, it's now known
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.640]   that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.540]   can offset some of the benefits of exercise.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:33.380]   And that makes sense
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.060]   because a lot of the adaptive benefits of exercise
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:36.780]   actually come from experiencing
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:38.600]   a lot of inflammation acutely.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.180]   That means you actually want inflammation
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.560]   during your resistance training workout
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.120]   or even your endurance workout.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.840]   But then that inflammation triggers an adaptation event
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.520]   or series of adaptation events
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.480]   that leads to greater strength, greater speed,
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.500]   more muscle, more endurance,
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.420]   whatever it is that you happen to be training for.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.880]   So reducing pain can be good, of course,
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.800]   but not if you have to take more and more of a given drug
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.740]   that has side effects on the liver
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:03.600]   and can offset the effects of exercise and so forth.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.240]   The other issue with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.340]   is that many of them simply do not work for many people.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:11.520]   Or again, they'll work the first time and the second time,
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.560]   but then they stop working.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.920]   They also tend to lower body temperature.
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.960]   I think most people are aware of this
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:19.240]   because many of these same drugs are used
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.060]   in order to reduce fever.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:24.500]   But if you are taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.120]   simply to reduce your headache
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:27.820]   and your lowing core body temperature,
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:30.360]   that can have all sorts of downstream issues
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.920]   related to sleep-wake cycles, to metabolism,
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:35.960]   to immune system function more generally, and on and on.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.560]   For that reason, there's been quite a lot of exploration
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.560]   of alternatives to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.400]   for the treatment of headache and indeed pain generally.
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.920]   But today we're talking about headache.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:51.200]   Now, as it relates to tension headache,
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.980]   one of the more advanced kind of modern treatments
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:56.580]   that you sometimes hear about is Botox, right?
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:58.840]   Botox, I think most people are familiar with
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.780]   as the thing that people get injected into their face
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:04.000]   around the eyes or around the lips or elsewhere
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.540]   in order to quote unquote reduce wrinkles.
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:07.860]   It was discovered some years ago
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:10.840]   when Botox treatments were being done for cosmetic reasons
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.380]   that it could often be very effective for relieving headache
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.240]   if injected into the muscles.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.620]   And the way that it works is that of course,
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:21.120]   tension headache involves a tension of the muscles,
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.460]   kind of a, we'll call it clinching
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:24.420]   or synching up with the muscles,
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:26.480]   but we're really talking about is contraction of the muscles
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:29.480]   and that's controlled by neurons.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.820]   Neurons, which are neuromuscular,
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:35.660]   so neuromuscular neurons that don't form synapses with,
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:36.980]   or connections with other neurons,
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.780]   they form synapses with muscle.
[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:40.940]   They release acetylcholine onto the muscle
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.300]   and that makes the muscle contract.
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:44.180]   This is the way you move the limbs of your body.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:47.340]   This is also the way the muscles of your head contract
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:50.020]   and can give you tension type headaches.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:55.020]   Botox arises from, or is rather botulinum neurotoxin.
[01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:59.540]   Botulinum neurotoxin is a toxin that's found in canned goods,
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:00.860]   not all canned goods of course.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:04.420]   And what it does is it prevents a certain step
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:08.540]   in the release of so-called neurotransmitter
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:10.540]   in the little packets that they live in,
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:11.460]   which are called vesicles,
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:13.740]   little spheres of neurotransmitter
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.740]   live at the end of neuron nerve terminals
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:18.180]   and are released onto the muscle, make the muscle contract.
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:22.020]   Botulinum neurotoxin cleaves a particular protein in there.
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:23.600]   For you aficionados who want to look this up,
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.920]   it's a really cool mechanism.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:27.680]   It cleaves something called SNAP-25.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.580]   SNAP-25 is involved in the fusion of those little spheres
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:32.840]   with the membrane of the neuron
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.420]   and releasing of the neurotransmitter.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.260]   So when botulinum neurotoxin
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:39.140]   is present at the nerve muscle interface,
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.380]   those nerves cannot communicate with the muscle
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:42.380]   and as a consequence,
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:45.780]   the muscles undergo kind of flaccid tone.
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.940]   They just kind of relax there underneath the skin.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.400]   Sure, wrinkles are relieved,
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.760]   but if Botox is injected into the muscles themselves,
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.840]   it can provide long lasting relief
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.460]   of certain types of headaches,
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:59.180]   in particular tension type headaches.
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:01.940]   So while it seems like a bit of an extreme treatment,
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:04.500]   people who suffer very badly from tension type headaches
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.580]   due to hyper contraction of the muscles of the forehead
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.780]   or around the temples or around the jaws
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:14.140]   or certain parts of the neck and the muscles of the neck
[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:16.960]   that encroach on the back of the skull,
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.380]   or that actually connect to the back of the skull,
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:21.700]   can achieve tremendous long lasting relief
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.000]   from these Botox injections.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.820]   Sometimes for weeks or months or even longer,
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.640]   people go in for periodic re-ups of Botox.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.020]   It actually is quite safe despite the fact
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:34.580]   that botulinum neurotoxin is quite dangerous.
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.860]   It's given in very low doses and given locally,
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:38.500]   so those are the only muscles affected.
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.940]   So that's how Botox is used to treat headaches
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.420]   and is a very effective treatment at that.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:45.100]   Of course, many people, I imagine,
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:48.420]   are interested in not just drug-based treatments
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:52.180]   and not Botox type treatments for treating headache,
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.740]   but other types of treatments for headache
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:56.020]   that are of the more,
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:59.820]   so let's call them natural or non-drug treatments.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.700]   And here we're starting to get into the realm
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:05.500]   of the kind of herbal and oil-based treatments for headache.
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.700]   Now, I confess when I first started researching
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.700]   this area of headache and treatment for headaches, that is,
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:14.980]   I found myself approaching it with a bit of trepidation
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.340]   because when I started to hear about essential oils
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:21.000]   and about herbal medications and things of that sort,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.280]   I thought, okay, well, there'll probably be some effects.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.300]   I mean, admittedly, we've talked before on this podcast
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.100]   about things like apigenin.
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:31.620]   Apigenin is one of the core components of chamomile
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:33.700]   and chamomile is known to make people
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.040]   feel a little bit sleepy and can enhance sleep.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.380]   Well, apigenin in high concentration
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.680]   can indeed augment sleep.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.900]   We talk about this in our sleep toolkit.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:43.980]   By the way, we don't just have episodes about sleep,
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.900]   master your sleep, perfect your sleep, et cetera.
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:47.940]   But if you go to the Hubertmanlab.com website
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.460]   and you go to the menu and you click on newsletter,
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.420]   you can scroll down and you'll see
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:52.700]   that we have a toolkit for sleep.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.180]   There's completely zero cost to access.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:55.140]   You don't even have to sign up,
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.820]   although if you'd like to sign up for future newsletters,
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:58.680]   you can get those.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:02.360]   One of the key components of the toolkit for sleep
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.820]   in addition to behavioral tools
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:05.540]   and things that are not supplement-based
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:08.840]   is apigenin, which is this component from chamomile.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.520]   So the idea that certain herbal derivatives or herbs
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.880]   or oils could be very useful
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.240]   for improving symptoms of whatever,
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:21.200]   in this case, improving sleep with apigenin
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.680]   is not unheard of and in fact,
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.460]   the data continued to be released all the time,
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:28.200]   that many of the things that we think of as herbal, et cetera
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.940]   can actually have quite potent effects.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:33.680]   And so while I myself was approaching the discussion
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.000]   about essential oils and, or I should say oils, right?
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.080]   Who's to say if they're essential or not?
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.960]   Oils and herbs in the treatment of headache,
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:45.360]   I finished out my research on this literature,
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:49.620]   feeling quite, I should say, surprised
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:52.680]   and as if I need to really check myself a bit
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:54.920]   because what I found is that there are certain herbs
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:59.300]   and oils, for instance, that far outperform non-steroid
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:02.200]   and anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of headache.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.640]   That's right, there are certain oils
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.260]   that are available over the counter
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:09.120]   that when looked at in many studies, meta-analyses,
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.540]   and I'll tell you about one particular study
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.220]   and a meta-analysis in a moment,
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:15.700]   they show that they can reduce the frequency
[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:18.160]   and intensity of headache in a manner
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.660]   that far outpaces what you observe
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:22.620]   with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:24.400]   with apparently none of the same issues
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.640]   associated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:29.560]   So I think it's really worth paying attention to.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.840]   The first of those studies that I'd like to describe to you
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.320]   is one that has now become kind of a classic
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.680]   in the literature, I should say,
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.000]   at least for those that are interested
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.340]   in the atypical treatments for headache.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:40.720]   And the title of this paper
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.880]   is Effect of Peppermint and Eucalyptus Oil Preparations
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.120]   on Neurophysiological and Experimental
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.800]   Algismetric Headache Parameters.
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:51.000]   Okay, what does that mean?
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.640]   Well, this is an interesting study
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.040]   because rather than look at the effectiveness
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.260]   of peppermint and eucalyptus oil and other oils on headache,
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.840]   what they did is because they want to look
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.760]   at the mechanisms underlying headache,
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:03.800]   which I confess I love,
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.660]   the fact that they want to understand the neurophysiology
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.460]   and not just get subjective ratings of headache,
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:09.300]   although they did that too,
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.100]   but they really want to understand
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:14.000]   how these oils can impact things like muscular tension
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.720]   or perception of pain.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:19.420]   What they did is they recreated headache in human subjects
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:22.880]   by using tightening cuffs of the head.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.600]   They cut off blood supply to certain areas of the head.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.160]   They basically induced headache,
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.040]   and then they measured things like the EMG,
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.800]   the muscle response at the level of electrophysiology
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:34.400]   in the muscle, and of course,
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.320]   subjective measures of how much people perceive
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.700]   to be in pain or not in pain.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:40.260]   I'll give you the broad contour of the study
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:42.260]   because I want to make sure that it's the conclusions
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:43.280]   that come through most clearly,
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.920]   and we will provide a link to the study
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.680]   in our show note captions.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:50.200]   So what they did is they had people use
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.240]   one of four different preparations.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:53.120]   So they had preparation one,
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.840]   which includes some peppermint oil and some eucalyptus oil,
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.700]   and all the details about the amount
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:00.300]   and the relative percentages are in the paper
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:03.000]   for you to peruse online through the link
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:03.980]   I mentioned before.
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:05.160]   So they had four different groups.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:08.900]   They had one group apply peppermint oil,
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:12.020]   but that peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.440]   They had another group use just peppermint oil.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:18.100]   They had another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.160]   and smaller doses of eucalyptus oil.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:22.720]   And then they had a fourth group,
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.820]   which was just using placebo.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.100]   When I say using, what they were doing
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:29.320]   is they were sponge applying the oil
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.960]   to the temples and forehead of people.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.400]   And then what they did
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.640]   is they used these different approaches
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:40.360]   to measure the activation of muscles, to measure pain,
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:44.540]   and they then induced head pain, they induced headache.
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.700]   So, and they looked at the temporal muscles on the side,
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.740]   they looked at forehead muscles, things of that sort.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:51.260]   So they used three different types of pain stimuli.
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:53.760]   They looked at people's sensitivity
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:58.760]   to experimentally induced pain by either providing pressure.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.120]   So this was kind of a cuff around the forehead
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:03.460]   or thermal pain.
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:06.960]   So they actually had them basically heated up
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.360]   at the level of the skin.
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.040]   And actually they brought the heat up pretty high
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.080]   to the point where people were rating the pain
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.580]   almost to the point of excessive pain and pain limits.
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:19.000]   So they obviously couldn't take them
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.760]   to the point of extreme pain.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.100]   And they had a constriction type condition
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:26.120]   in which they cut off blood circulation
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.600]   to the pericranial muscles
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.080]   using an inflatable collar around the cranium
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.360]   and they inflated that to pretty high pressure.
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.640]   So kind of a brutal experiment to be involved in,
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.240]   but look, they're trying to mimic headache.
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:40.040]   And I think by using these different approaches,
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:42.160]   they're able to mimic the different aspects of headache
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.520]   and make sure, and here's the key point,
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.280]   that every person in the study
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:48.160]   is not just getting the same treatment for headache,
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.680]   but is getting the same headache.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:52.440]   And that's something that I think gives this study power.
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.040]   It's not the only way to do a study like this,
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:56.600]   but it gives it a lot of power in trying to understand
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.960]   which types of interventions are going to assist
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.220]   in headache and maybe even specific dimensions
[01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.280]   of the pain and headache.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.360]   And basically what they found in the study
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.520]   is that of all the treatments they used,
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:08.840]   the essential plant oil preparations
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.480]   that contained peppermint,
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:13.440]   and I'll just mention as an aside,
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.480]   and in other studies, menthol,
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.480]   so these minty type essential, what we think of as flavors,
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.400]   but are really aromas as well.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:25.820]   And as I'll point out the mechanism in a moment,
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:27.880]   they had the effect of significantly reducing
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.060]   the intensity of the pain.
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:31.820]   That is, subjects could tolerate the pain far better
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:34.600]   and experienced less pain subjectively.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.080]   And the magnitude of the effects
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.560]   were really pretty impressive.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.600]   Again, I went into all of this thinking essential oils,
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.800]   okay, that's like some really woo stuff.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.800]   You know, I don't know about that,
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.320]   but it turns out that these essential oils,
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:49.680]   at least the ones that contain peppermint oil
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:51.760]   with or without eucalyptus oil
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:54.120]   performed very well in reducing pain.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:55.740]   The key takeaway from the study is,
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:57.280]   and here I'm paraphrasing from the study
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:00.920]   that the combination of peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil,
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:03.600]   and these are basically in a ethanol suspension.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.880]   Again, people are not drinking these essential oils.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:06.720]   I want to be very clear.
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.480]   They're applying these to the skin
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.180]   around the area that's in pain
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:13.360]   and particularly the temple and the foreheads.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:15.540]   Increased cognitive performance.
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:16.420]   I didn't talk about that,
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:18.980]   but this is the ability to maintain cognitive functioning
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:19.820]   while in pain.
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:22.720]   You know, here we're talking about headache up until now,
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:24.360]   just as kind of pain,
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.440]   but that pain can be very debilitating
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.960]   for your ability to work and perform and do other things.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.100]   So this combination of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:33.380]   applied to the skin
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:35.580]   allowed people to increase their cognitive performance
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:36.440]   while under pain,
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:39.480]   and it had a very muscle relaxing
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.960]   and mentally relaxing effect.
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.920]   Mental relaxation was of course measured subjectively,
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.140]   but remember one of the things
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:47.800]   that led me to feature this study
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.720]   in this episode in particular is that
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.080]   they didn't just say, "Oh, my muscles feel more relaxed."
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.440]   They actually saw that the muscles
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.120]   of the forehead and temples
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.680]   and some surrounding muscles were more relaxed
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:02.460]   when people had these oils applied to their forehead
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:03.640]   and the temples.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:05.380]   Not perhaps to the same degree
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:07.340]   that one would observe with Botox
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:09.060]   or for the same extent or duration
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.540]   as one would experience with Botox,
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:12.040]   but much in the same way,
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.440]   which then raises the question of,
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:14.420]   well, what's going on here?
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:15.740]   I mean, is this all placebo effect?
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:17.560]   Well, no, because they compared to placebo
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:20.300]   and they controlled for the odor, of course,
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.520]   of the oil that was applied
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:23.920]   so that everyone thought that they were getting
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.040]   essentially the same thing, pun intended.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.140]   But in this case, what they found
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:32.960]   is that if they applied the essential oil
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.940]   to the forehead and temples,
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:38.620]   that people experience more or less a cooling sensation
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:40.540]   or they could feel as if something was happening
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:41.860]   in the underlying muscle.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:43.100]   Well, what was happening?
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:46.300]   We now know that menthol, peppermint,
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:49.840]   and other things that smell that way and taste that way
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.960]   actually have an impact on the sensory neurons
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:53.760]   at the level of the skin
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.080]   and can actually inhibit certain sensory neurons
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.760]   and can activate other sensory neurons.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:01.880]   Okay, so in order to understand this,
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.960]   we have to go back to what I said
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:03.960]   at the beginning of the episode,
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.260]   which is that you have motor neurons.
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:06.780]   These are neurons that constrict muscles,
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:10.480]   or excuse me, that cause contraction of muscles.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.320]   They don't constrict them.
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:12.700]   They cause contraction of muscles.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:15.080]   You have sensory neurons, which sense different things,
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:19.200]   light, sound, or touch, and you have modulatory neurons.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.380]   Menthol and eucalyptus are actually known
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:25.040]   to activate certain channels in the sensory neurons
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.020]   that respond not just to touch,
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:29.440]   but also the sensation of cooling.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.480]   Okay, so when we think of menthol and peppermint,
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:34.720]   we think of kind of cool scents and flavors,
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.520]   cool meaning cold.
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:40.120]   And when we think of things like hot peppers, capsaicin,
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.760]   we think of anything that has a hot temperature,
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.160]   we tend to think of spicy.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:46.020]   So spicy and hot go together,
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:50.680]   and peppermint and menthol and cool go together,
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.100]   much in the way that the gum commercials
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.300]   or the mint commercials would lead you to believe,
[01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.000]   and in fact, they're right.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.960]   So what's happening here is that the application
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.260]   of these oils is very likely activating channels
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.080]   in these sensory neurons, including the TRIP channels,
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:05.840]   but others as well, that are leading to the energies
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:10.660]   effect by shutting down the heat and pain pathways,
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:13.640]   because heat and pain, while they're not exactly the same
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:14.700]   in our nervous system,
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:17.280]   they are funneled through common pathways,
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:20.440]   whereas cooling and pain relief are funneled
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:23.160]   through alternate, what we call parallel pathways.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:26.960]   So the study on peppermint and eucalyptus oil preparations
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:30.240]   in reducing pain of headache
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.400]   and different aspects of pain due to headache,
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.680]   I think are really important
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.440]   because they don't just illustrate the fact
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:38.020]   that yes, indeed, I'll go on record saying it,
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:39.040]   'cause that's what the data say,
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.360]   and there are other papers
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.980]   to support this statement as well.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:44.940]   Essential oils applied to the skin can reduce the symptoms
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:46.800]   of tension headache in a significant way,
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:49.060]   and actually can lead to some offset
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:52.200]   of some of the cognitive defects seen with headaches.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.200]   So that's itself very impressive, I must say,
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.140]   but surprising for me, kind of put me in my place
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.680]   as somebody who thought, oh, essential oils
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:00.100]   is going to be like, okay,
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.840]   but it's actually seemed to really hold some merit.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:05.120]   And when you compare the magnitude of the effect,
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.540]   even though this wasn't an enormous number of subjects,
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.480]   you compare the magnitude of the effect
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.640]   in a paper like this or similar papers
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.720]   on these essential oils
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:15.880]   to the impact of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.360]   and they really hold their own,
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:20.400]   and in some cases exceed the positive impact
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.180]   of anti-inflammatory drugs.
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.960]   So for that reason, I think we can look at peppermint oils
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.080]   and peppermint and eucalyptus containing oils,
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.600]   menthol containing oils applied to the skin
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.680]   for the treatment of tension type headache
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:34.880]   as among the more potent treatments available out there.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:37.920]   Now, another way to approach treatment of tension headache
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:38.920]   is something that many of you
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:41.000]   have probably heard about before.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.360]   And then I've talked a little bit about on this podcast
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:45.760]   in previous episodes, and that's acupuncture.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.240]   We will do an entire episode all about acupuncture,
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:50.760]   but much in the same way that essential oils,
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:52.380]   I think for many people, not all,
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:55.480]   but for many people are considered kind of a woo biology
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.840]   or people think of it as very alternative medicine.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:01.160]   Keep in mind that as the underlying mechanisms
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.680]   of things like these peppermint oils
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:03.720]   are starting to be discovered
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:06.000]   or omega-3s are starting to be discovered,
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.060]   mechanistically, they hold up very well.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:09.080]   There's a logic there.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.280]   There's an underlying understanding
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.360]   of not just why they should work,
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.480]   but in many cases, how they work.
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:17.260]   In the same way, acupuncture,
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:19.720]   which of course has existed for thousands of years,
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.920]   has been used very successfully
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:24.100]   to treat headache and other forms of pain,
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:26.680]   so much so that many insurance companies
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:30.560]   will now pay for acupuncture as an insured practice,
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.320]   not all, but many will.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.080]   And in addition to that,
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.000]   the scientific community is starting to understand
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.840]   mechanistically how acupuncture works.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:40.920]   So I don't want to make this the major focus for now,
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:44.280]   but very briefly, there's a laboratory
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:47.040]   at Harvard Medical School run by Chufu Ma.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.600]   Chufu is well-known in the neuroscience community
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:53.440]   for doing excellent work in parsing the mechanisms
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.720]   of touch sensation and pain in particular.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:58.200]   So not just touch at the level of skin,
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.880]   but pain and pain pathways.
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:00.800]   And in recent years,
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:02.840]   his laboratory has started to do studies
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:04.680]   on how acupuncture works,
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.140]   because indeed acupuncture has been known to work
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:08.580]   to alleviate pain for a long time,
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:11.480]   but the underlying mechanisms haven't been clear.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.280]   What Chufu's lab has published now in excellent journals
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.880]   like "Nature," "Science," and other journals
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.880]   is that the precise insertion sites of different needles
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.760]   lead to activation of sensory neurons
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.160]   and their downstream pathways
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:29.720]   in ways that can potently reduce inflammation
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.500]   and that can be used to potently reduce the activity
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.560]   of certain muscles.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.380]   For instance, muscles in the forehead and temples.
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:40.880]   So when you hear acupuncture can reduce pain,
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:41.720]   I think some people think,
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:43.580]   "Oh, well, if there's needles sticking out of your face,
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.420]   first of all, that must hurt."
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.120]   And actually the needles are very fine needles
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:48.160]   and skilled acupuncturists can insert them
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.200]   without any pain or actually the person receiving it
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:53.880]   doesn't even usually recognize that the needles are in.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:56.840]   That's how quickly and efficiently they can put them in
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.740]   and people don't detect any pain.
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:02.340]   But that has been shown to greatly reduce pain
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:06.060]   in particular headache-related pain and back-related pain
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:07.600]   and some other forms of pain.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:09.300]   Chufu's lab has shown
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:11.780]   that the specific needle insertion sites
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:14.140]   can activate the sensory pathways
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:18.620]   and can deactivate the sensory motor pathways,
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:20.220]   and now you're familiar with sensory neurons,
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:22.040]   motor neurons, and modulatory neurons,
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:26.560]   and can modulate the activity of the pain pathways
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.180]   by way of impacting the activity of all sorts
[02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:31.640]   of different organs, including organs that give rise
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:33.580]   to some of the inflammatory cytokines.
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:35.340]   So basically what I'm saying here
[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:38.840]   is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.120]   and the maps of different insertion sites,
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:44.440]   we now know, or I should say people have long known
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:47.320]   and people in the West are starting to adopt
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:49.100]   the understanding that acupuncture,
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:51.960]   yes, indeed, it really does work for relieving pain.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.060]   And laboratories, both in the United States,
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:56.480]   such as Chufu's and elsewhere,
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.460]   are starting to find the underlying mechanisms.
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.920]   And those mechanisms include deactivation
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.620]   of the pain pathways,
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:05.880]   activation of some of the parallel pathways
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:07.980]   that assist in shutting down pain
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.780]   or in relaxing the muscles
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.520]   that are causing tension type headache,
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.440]   as well as activation of neural pathways
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:18.040]   that impinge on organs that then cause
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:21.120]   or reduce the release of molecules into the body
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.440]   that give us the experience of pain.
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:24.560]   So reduced inflammation and in many cases,
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:27.540]   increasing anti-inflammatory pathways.
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:30.440]   So I just wanted to be sure to mention acupuncture
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:32.280]   and a little bit of mechanistic understanding
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.640]   of why acupuncture works,
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.560]   because indeed acupuncture is shown to be quite effective
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:38.200]   for the treatment of tension type headache
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.700]   and to some extent, migraine headache as well.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:42.900]   So we talked about omega-3 fatty acids.
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:44.420]   We talked about essential oils.
[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.520]   We talked about acupuncture.
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:47.940]   So this episode is starting to sound
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:51.460]   like alternative treatments to headache, including migraine,
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.720]   but I want to be very clear.
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:56.140]   This is not about alternative treatments.
[02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:57.440]   Everything that I'm talking about here
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:59.660]   has a mechanistic basis.
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.660]   And what we're talking about today
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:04.100]   are approaches to dealing with headache
[02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:07.760]   that yes, are typically over-the-counter compounds
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.820]   or are grounded in nutrition
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:13.080]   or in the case of acupuncture, behavioral practices,
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:16.640]   but that are not necessarily meant as replacements
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.980]   for things like non-steroid and inflammatory drugs
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:19.920]   or prescription drugs.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:21.960]   Of course, those things can still be taken.
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:24.080]   Many people derive benefit from them,
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:26.660]   but the goal is always, I believe,
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:29.060]   or I should hope, for people to find ways
[02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:31.640]   that they can control their health outcomes
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.640]   and reduce things like headache
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:35.540]   using a minimum number of things
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.560]   that have other side effects.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.660]   And that of course can also include the use of essential oils
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:41.820]   in conjunction with things
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:44.100]   like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:46.560]   or the use of red light to offset photophobia
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:49.640]   in conjunction with any number of different treatments,
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:51.100]   either prescription or otherwise.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.580]   So I do want to make that clear.
[02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:53.900]   And I especially want to make that clear
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:56.100]   as I transition to the next segment
[02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:57.040]   where I'm going to tell you
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:59.660]   about herbal treatments for migraine.
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:01.580]   And this is based on what I consider
[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:04.020]   a very comprehensive review
[02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:06.660]   of many randomized control studies.
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:07.880]   Indeed, the title of the paper
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:09.260]   is "Herbal Treatments for Migraine,
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:12.220]   "A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Studies."
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:14.020]   And this was published in 2020,
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:16.620]   and this contains an immense amount of information.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:18.420]   So we will provide a link to it
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:20.480]   for those of you that really want to dive deep on this.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:23.240]   In this paper, they focus on a number of different reviews
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:25.740]   and analysis of data focused on compounds
[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:27.140]   for the treatment of migraine,
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:30.640]   ranging from and including things like menthol
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:31.700]   and peppermint oil.
[02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:32.640]   So we already covered that,
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:34.140]   so I won't cover that again in detail.
[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:37.120]   But in this review, they highlight the results
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.440]   I referred to before plus other results
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:41.960]   that show that menthol and peppermint oil
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:44.060]   can be quite effective in the treatment
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.660]   of tension type headache,
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:48.440]   and in this case, migraine headache as well.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:51.040]   So that's interesting that menthol and peppermint oils
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:54.060]   can be used not just to treat tension type headaches,
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:56.880]   but migraine headaches as well.
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:59.900]   And they look at an enormous number of other types
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:02.460]   of herbal and essential oil type treatments,
[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:05.780]   everything from coriander to citron to damask rose,
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:07.620]   chamomile, lavender, a bunch of things.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:10.340]   So I'm not going to go through each and every one of these
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:11.940]   in a lot of detail.
[02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:14.300]   What I've tended to do today and I'm going to do now
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:16.220]   is to highlight the most potent
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:18.980]   of these different treatments.
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:22.220]   Again, menthol peppermint oil being among the most potent.
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:25.080]   In addition to that, there's a particular pathway
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:27.460]   that's associated with headache.
[02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:30.760]   And when I say that, I mean the different types of headache,
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:33.180]   which includes the activation of this thing
[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:34.420]   that we call CGRP.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:37.740]   CGRP, again, is involved in this calcium regulation pathway
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:41.940]   and leads to vasodilation of the vessels
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:43.580]   and arteries and capillaries
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:44.820]   in a way that can create pain
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:47.360]   and this feeling of pressure inside the head,
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:49.900]   which can be very uncomfortable, of course.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:51.620]   Now, earlier in the episode,
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:54.660]   I mentioned that I was going to touch on caffeine.
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.300]   And so I'm going to do that now.
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:57.780]   Now, the reason I mentioned caffeine
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:00.520]   is that there's a sort of lore out there
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:01.740]   that if you have a headache,
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:05.020]   drinking a cup of coffee can eliminate that headache.
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:06.300]   A few things about that point.
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:08.220]   First of all, if you are somebody
[02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:11.020]   who ingests caffeine every day
[02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:13.100]   and you do not ingest caffeine,
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:15.060]   you will indeed get a headache
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:18.600]   and drinking caffeine will relieve that particular headache.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:21.300]   So it's absolutely true that caffeine can relieve
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:23.860]   the lack of caffeine induced headache.
[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:25.220]   That's sort of a duh.
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:29.300]   But that leads actually to a very important question,
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.980]   which is why would that be the case?
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:35.300]   Well, it turns out that caffeine is both a vasodilator
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:38.020]   and a vasoconstrictor.
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:38.900]   How does it do that?
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:41.040]   Well, one of the main ways in which caffeine
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.380]   makes us more alert is that it occupies the receptors
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:45.660]   for something called adenosine.
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:48.820]   Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body
[02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:50.800]   more and more the longer we've been awake.
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.680]   It's one of the things that makes us feel sleepy.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.260]   So when we drink caffeine,
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:57.900]   that caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:00.060]   and the adenosine cannot have its normal effect
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:01.320]   of making us sleepy.
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:02.560]   When that caffeine wears off,
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:05.020]   the adenosine combine and we feel sleepy.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:08.120]   Adenosine is a vasodilator.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.900]   So when we drink caffeine,
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:12.580]   because it blocks the effects of adenosine,
[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:14.920]   there is a vasoconstriction
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:17.020]   associated with drinking caffeine.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:19.300]   So if you have a headache that is associated
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.080]   with excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head,
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.280]   indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.720]   by preventing that adenosine pathway
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.440]   that would normally lead to vasoconstriction
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:32.580]   and you can get some relief from that headache.
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:35.940]   However, caffeine is also a vasodilator.
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:37.860]   Caffeine has the ability to impinge
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:40.880]   on the so-called NO pathway, the nitric oxide pathway,
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:43.920]   which is a nerve to blood pathway
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.360]   that involves a few different enzymes
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.420]   that we won't get into right now,
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.400]   but maybe in a future episode
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.060]   that causes dilation of the blood vessels.
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:52.000]   And as a consequence,
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.440]   drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation.
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:56.320]   So it's sort of a two-pronged effect.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:59.020]   Now, one of the ways in which you might think about this
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:03.020]   and perhaps utilize this is that if you are well-rested
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:04.380]   or if it's early in the day
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:07.040]   and you've had some sleep the previous night,
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.800]   adenosine levels are very likely to be low,
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:12.400]   especially if you slept very well the night before.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:16.260]   Under those conditions, when you ingest caffeine,
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:18.200]   you are not going to experience
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:21.520]   the vasoconstriction effects of caffeine
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.660]   that would ordinarily be there by inhibiting adenosine.
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.500]   Why?
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:27.760]   Because adenosine is not present at all.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.840]   And under those conditions,
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:31.920]   drinking coffee ought to lead to some vasodilation.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.160]   Not a lot, but nonetheless vasodilation.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.120]   If, however, you haven't slept well
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:37.960]   or it's late in the day
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.000]   and you've been up for a long time,
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.680]   drinking caffeine is likely to have
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:42.520]   more of a vasoconstriction effect.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:43.680]   And this is important
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.640]   because some of the treatments that you hear about
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.280]   that involve using caffeine to treat headache
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:50.840]   are as extreme as, okay, if you have a headache at night,
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:52.560]   drink a cup of coffee and then go to sleep.
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.980]   I actually saw that in the literature,
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:56.920]   which I couldn't quite believe because yes, indeed,
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:58.760]   some people can fall asleep after drinking caffeine,
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.240]   but we know very well,
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:03.040]   thanks to the beautiful work and science communications
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:05.400]   of people like Dr. Matthew Walker from University of
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.560]   California, Berkeley,
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:09.260]   and who's been a guest on this and many other podcasts
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:12.080]   that even if you can fall asleep after drinking caffeine,
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:14.220]   ingesting caffeine within the 10 to 12 hours
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:15.940]   prior to bedtime is simply not a good idea
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:18.500]   because of the ways it disrupts the architecture of sleep.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:20.760]   So what's the takeaway about caffeine and headache
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.080]   and vasodilation?
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:25.040]   You need to be very clear on whether or not
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:27.720]   caffeine tends to remove your headache or exacerbate it.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:29.440]   Now, this is going to depend on time of day
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.860]   and the amount of adenosine in your system,
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:31.700]   as I mentioned before,
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:34.940]   but also there seems to be a kind of bimodal distribution
[02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:36.900]   whereby some people, when they drink caffeine,
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:38.920]   it really improves their headache.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:41.480]   And so in some cases, very significant effects,
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:42.980]   whereas other people, when they drink caffeine,
[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:44.880]   it really exacerbates their headache.
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:47.320]   And as least as far as I could tell from the literature,
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:50.540]   it's not easy to predict who those people are going to be.
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:52.080]   What is reassuring, however,
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.740]   is it does not seem to be the case that if you're somebody
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:57.780]   who experiences relief from headaches by drinking caffeine,
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:00.320]   that suddenly one day to the next,
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.860]   you're going to experience a worsening of your headache
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:04.480]   and vice versa is also true.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.480]   So if you're somebody that drinks caffeine
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:07.720]   and your headaches get worse,
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:08.900]   I don't think there's any reason to think
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:11.860]   that caffeine one day or from one day to the next rather
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:13.460]   is going to somehow alleviate your headache.
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:14.760]   So you have to determine for yourself
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:17.160]   whether or not headaches are relieved or exacerbated
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:18.300]   by drinking caffeine.
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:19.800]   And if you're wondering why it's so confusing,
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:21.780]   it's because caffeine hits both the vasodilation
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:23.680]   and the vasoconstriction pathways,
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:26.360]   and there's nothing you or I or anyone else can do about it.
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.780]   Now, the last thing I'd like to talk about
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:29.680]   in terms of relief for headaches
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:32.060]   is something that I'm guessing about
[02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:33.880]   probably 25% of you are familiar with
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:37.100]   and 75% of you are not, which is curcumin.
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:40.200]   Curcumin is often also referred to as turmeric
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:41.860]   and turmeric is a root
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:44.740]   and curcumin is one of the key components of that root.
[02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:46.620]   Curcumin is known to have
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:50.300]   very potent anti-inflammatory properties.
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:51.940]   I don't think that's debated at all.
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:54.760]   In fact, it's so potent as an anti-inflammatory
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.220]   that some people have cautioned against taking
[02:13:57.220 --> 02:13:59.800]   high levels of curcumin prior to, for instance,
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:02.360]   resistance training workouts or even cardiovascular workouts
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:05.040]   because it so prevents inflammation
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:08.480]   that it also can prevent the adaptation response.
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:10.380]   Because remember, the inflammation that occurs
[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:13.720]   during exercise, both resistance and cardiovascular exercise
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.420]   is at least in part the trigger for the adaptation
[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:20.640]   that it's going to lead to enhanced endurance,
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.680]   enhanced strength, hypertrophy, et cetera.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:24.600]   Nonetheless, curcumin has been explored
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.240]   in the context of treatment of migraine
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:29.140]   and it's one of the compounds that was analyzed
[02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:31.520]   in extensive detail in this wonderful review
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.360]   that I mentioned a little bit earlier.
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:35.480]   What I like about this study is that they were able to
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:37.520]   explore the effects of curcumin
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.480]   as explored in previous research studies
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:44.660]   and compare those across a large range of different dosages
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:47.480]   and a large range of combinations
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:49.280]   with other things like coenzyme Q10,
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:50.960]   which we've talked about on this podcast before.
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:52.960]   But I think for sake of this discussion,
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:57.080]   just really focusing on what curcumin does alone
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:00.300]   or in conjunction with the omega-3 fatty acids
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:02.020]   is what turns out to be the most interesting.
[02:15:02.020 --> 02:15:04.600]   First of all, curcumin has been shown to be
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:06.600]   generally safe for most people
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:10.120]   at dosages as high as 8,000 milligrams per day
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.460]   or eight grams per day.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.660]   Now, I want to be very clear.
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:16.520]   I do not recommend that anyone take dosages of curcumin,
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.600]   AKA turmeric, that are that high.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.440]   Why?
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:24.000]   Because curcumin and turmeric not only are anti-inflammatory
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]   but they also can impinge on other pathways
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.280]   in particular hormonal pathways.
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.460]   And in fact, curcumin, AKA turmeric,
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:35.120]   can alter the synthesis of something called
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:36.400]   dihydrotestosterone.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:38.880]   Dihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.120]   of different bodily functions.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:41.500]   It's involved in libido.
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:43.640]   It's involved in men and beard growth
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:46.900]   and in the regulation of a number of different tissues,
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:48.320]   both in the reproductive axis
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:49.840]   and outside the reproductive axis.
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:53.600]   And curcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT.
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:56.380]   So I do want to caution that people who take high doses
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:58.480]   of curcumin and some people who are very sensitive
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.200]   to curcumin will even at low doses experience reductions
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:05.520]   in DHT that lead to things that they would not like,
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.720]   such as sufficient reductions in libido.
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:11.280]   However, curcumin has been shown to be effective
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.760]   as an anti-inflammatory and has been shown
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:17.340]   to be very effective in treating different types of headache
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:18.840]   in particular migraine headache.
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:22.480]   One of the ways in which curcumin does that is to inhibit
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:23.940]   this thing that I talked about a few minutes ago,
[02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:28.080]   which is nitric oxide or NO, which causes vasodilation.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:31.200]   And in doing that can reduce the feeling
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.920]   that one has a lot of intracranial pressure, okay?
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.160]   So curcumin dosages come in an enormous range,
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:39.860]   as I mentioned before, dosages that range anywhere
[02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:44.120]   from 80 milligrams, taken 80 milligrams per day, that is,
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.720]   taken for eight weeks time, that's been examined.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.140]   It's been explored at 80 milligram dosages,
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:52.360]   taken alongside two and a half grams
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:57.040]   of omega-3 fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids alone
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.100]   and against placebo.
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:01.020]   And the general conclusion of these studies is
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:05.620]   that curcumin when taken at dosages of about 80 milligrams,
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.860]   although for those of you very sensitive to curcumin,
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.480]   probably as low as 25 or even 50 milligrams per day
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:13.420]   in conjunction with, although not necessarily
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:17.520]   at the same time, but taken daily alongside
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:21.160]   omega-3 fatty acids at two and a half grams per day
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.400]   led to significant improvements in migraine
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:28.080]   and other forms of headache, meaning both the frequency
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:30.260]   and the intensity of the headaches that occurred
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:31.560]   was greatly reduced.
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:34.480]   One important point about curcumin to keep in mind
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:36.360]   is that curcumin is known to inhibit something
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:39.400]   called cytochrome P450.
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:41.700]   That's associated with an enzymatic pathway
[02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:44.960]   and some other things that relate to blood coagulation.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:46.920]   So for people that are taking medications
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.840]   that are anticoagulants to prevent clotting,
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:52.320]   you do need to be very cautious about using curcumin.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.820]   And of course, with curcumin or any other supplements,
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:57.520]   you should always talk to your doctor prior to including it
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:00.080]   or removing it from your supplement regimen.
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:02.300]   So as you can see, there are a number of different things
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:05.080]   that in addition to prescription drugs
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.080]   and over-the-counter pain medications,
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:09.940]   things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:13.480]   can really impact the different aspects of headache
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:15.300]   and different types of headache,
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:16.480]   in some cases, differentially.
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:19.320]   Now, today, we talked mainly about tension type
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:20.460]   and migraine type headaches,
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:22.840]   because those are the most common forms of headache.
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:24.720]   There are, of course, the cluster type headaches
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:27.400]   that are of neural origin, talked about hormonal headaches,
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.840]   and indeed, some treatments such as omega-3s,
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:31.400]   which have been shown to be beneficial
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:34.640]   for offsetting the menstrual-related headaches.
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:37.600]   Now, in the context of the discussion about omega-3s,
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:40.020]   keep in mind that omega-3s can be obtained
[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:42.420]   from supplementation or from nutrition.
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:45.820]   So you don't necessarily have to take omega-3 capsules
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:48.860]   or liquid form omega-3s if you want to use omega-3s
[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:51.200]   to target different symptoms of headache,
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:52.660]   but that probably is going to be
[02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:54.140]   the most efficient way to do it,
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:57.460]   given that many foods do contain omega-3s,
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:00.100]   but it's hard to get above that one gram dosage.
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:03.940]   And in fact, most of the studies that we talked about today
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.200]   involved getting two or even two and a half,
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.380]   or in some cases on this podcast with previous guests,
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:10.900]   such as Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:11.980]   she talked about the advantages
[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:14.860]   of getting as high as three grams of omega-3s per day,
[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:16.540]   which almost with certainty
[02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:19.520]   is going to require some external form of supplementation,
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.440]   even for those of you that are making a point
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:24.440]   to eat a fatty ocean fish with the skin on.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:26.380]   So I just want to make sure that I highlight that.
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:28.680]   Before we wrap up, I can't help myself,
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:30.200]   but to talk about something
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.040]   that I heard about on the news several years ago,
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.700]   and it sounded too outrageous to be true,
[02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:36.240]   but then was confirmed as accurate
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.940]   by one of my neurologist colleagues.
[02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:42.060]   And that's the fact that eating certain very spicy peppers
[02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:43.920]   can induce headache,
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:47.140]   and in some cases can induce brain damage.
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:48.460]   And bear with me here,
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:51.280]   I'm not talking about your traditional jalapeno,
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:54.160]   and I'm acknowledging the fact that certain people
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:58.540]   can tolerate far more spicy tastes than do others.
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.120]   Some people are very sensitive to spicy,
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:02.280]   some people can tolerate very spicy food,
[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:04.800]   and that one can build up a tolerance to spicy food
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:07.480]   by ingesting progressively spicier, excuse me,
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:10.760]   spicier and spicier foods over time.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.960]   Nonetheless, there are these pepper eating contests
[02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:17.120]   out there that, while not very common, do exist,
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.340]   and people challenge each other to eat peppers
[02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:21.320]   of extreme spiciness.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.440]   And there's one in particular that's referred to
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:24.840]   as the Carolina Reaper.
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:27.440]   By the way, that's not a person, as far as I know.
[02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.480]   That's a pepper, the Carolina Reaper,
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:33.160]   which is known to have the most potent spice of any pepper.
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:36.040]   And here's why you would not want to eat the Carolina Reaper.
[02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:38.840]   A few years ago at one of these pepper eating contests,
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:42.980]   man ate a Carolina Reaper as part of the competition,
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:44.720]   and suddenly experienced what's called
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:45.840]   thunderclap headache.
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:49.000]   Thunderclap headache is a unique type of headache,
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.680]   very different from all the other types of headache.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:55.280]   It is not from the surface in, so it's not tension headache.
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.100]   It's not even the cluster type headache
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.780]   of the nerve activation of the trigeminal.
[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:03.500]   It's actually a hyper constriction of the vasculature
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:06.580]   in the brain caused by the ingestion of the pepper,
[02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:08.340]   an inflammatory response.
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:11.460]   And remember that heat and spicy go together
[02:21:11.460 --> 02:21:12.940]   in these neural pathways,
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:15.160]   and a bunch of different heat-related
[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:18.940]   and spice-related pathways get activated simultaneously
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:21.300]   when one ingests something of extreme spice,
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:24.700]   and the blood vessels, and indeed some of the
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:27.860]   smaller arteries feeding neural tissue shut down,
[02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:29.700]   and he experienced this thunderclap headache,
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:33.020]   which is a brutal headache, and sadly, in his case,
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:35.420]   permanent brain damage, so loss of neuronal tissue,
[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:37.620]   because neuronal tissue is very metabolically active.
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:39.540]   You cut off the blood supply to that tissue.
[02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:43.540]   Not only would you feel miserable, maybe even pass out,
[02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:46.180]   but lose vision, and certain brain areas
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:48.700]   will actually die off in the absence of
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:50.680]   a blood flow to those areas.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:53.560]   We know this more commonly as stroke.
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:57.040]   So I don't want to strike fear in anybody
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.060]   about eating a jalapeno or even a very spicy meal
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:02.840]   from time to time, but if you're not somebody
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:05.780]   who's familiar with eating very spicy foods,
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:08.500]   you certainly don't want to enter one of these competitions
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:12.900]   and just realize that the pathways from menthol and cool
[02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:16.580]   or spicy and hot, those aren't just subjective pathways.
[02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:18.820]   These are actually neural pathways that, again,
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:21.340]   originate in our so-called, nerds call it
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:25.820]   the sensory epitheliums, so our skin, our hearing, our eyes,
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:29.160]   and that feed that information into the body
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.160]   to make use of that information.
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:33.060]   In some case, motor movements, so sensory motor.
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:36.400]   In other cases, the information can be fed
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.960]   through nerve pathways that goes to the vasculature
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:41.880]   and causes the vasculature to either dilate or constrict.
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:44.280]   These very spicy peppers causing, as I just mentioned,
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:48.160]   extreme cerebro of the head, vasoconstriction,
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:49.100]   and brain damage.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:52.500]   Again, that's not going to be a common thing out there,
[02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:55.700]   but nonetheless, I encourage people to be very cautious
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.480]   about the Carolina Reaper.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:59.780]   So today we talked about headaches,
[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:02.540]   and first we highlighted the different types of headache,
[02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.960]   making it clear that understanding which headache
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:08.180]   you might be experiencing can be very beneficial
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:10.420]   for understanding which sorts of treatments
[02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:13.940]   ought to be best and perhaps also best avoided
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:15.920]   in trying to alleviate those headaches
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:18.020]   or prevent them from happening at all.
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:19.960]   We talked about tension headaches, migraine headaches,
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:22.240]   hormone-based headaches, cluster headaches,
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:24.660]   and traumatic brain injury-related headaches.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:26.380]   We talked about different types of treatments
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:30.740]   ranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:33.560]   some herbal and indeed some essential oil treatments,
[02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:36.660]   as well as acupuncture, all of which have been shown
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:39.180]   to have significant impact in reducing the frequency
[02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:40.460]   and intensity of headaches.
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:43.100]   And in many cases, reductions in the frequency
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:45.660]   and intensity of headaches that are at least as great
[02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:47.180]   as the results that are seen
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:49.460]   with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:52.680]   Again, I want to highlight that none of these approaches
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:55.120]   are necessarily designed to be done on their own
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:57.740]   or in replacement of prescription drugs from your physician.
[02:23:57.740 --> 02:23:59.640]   There are excellent prescription drugs out there
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:01.380]   that your physician can prescribe for you
[02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:02.940]   for the treatment of headache.
[02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:04.780]   Nonetheless, I think many people
[02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:06.020]   who are listeners of this podcast
[02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:07.940]   are interested in the things that they can do
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:10.200]   in order to inoculate themselves
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:13.280]   or at least reduce the likelihood of experiencing headache,
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:15.740]   especially for people who are experiencing
[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:17.900]   chronic recurring headaches,
[02:24:17.900 --> 02:24:19.900]   such as migraine or the other forms of headache,
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:21.540]   which can be so debilitating.
[02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:23.760]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion.

[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:54.980]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:57.060]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.260]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:00.640]   And on both Instagram and Twitter,
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:02.580]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:04.260]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:05.380]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.500]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:08.660]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:10.980]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,
[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:12.300]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:14.540]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:17.020]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:19.140]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:21.480]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.020]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:27.820]   Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered with Momentous Supplements
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:30.320]   because Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:33.460]   and they include single ingredient formulations.
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:34.740]   This is very important.
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:36.140]   As I pointed out in the episode
[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:38.340]   about a rational approach to supplementation,
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:40.100]   single ingredient formulations allow you
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.240]   to develop the most biologically effective
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:44.640]   and cost-effective approach to supplementation.
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.100]   In addition, Momentous ships internationally,
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:49.780]   which is important because I realized that many of you reside
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:51.220]   outside of the United States.
[02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:53.140]   If you'd like to see the supplements described on this
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:55.180]   and other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:57.300]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:10.580]   and includes toolkits for everything
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:13.360]   from improving your sleep to deliberate cold exposure
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:16.340]   and heat exposure for health and performance, focus,
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:18.080]   dopamine regulation, and much more.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.900]   In order to sign up for the Huberman Lab Podcast

[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:37.500]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:39.340]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:41.920]   [upbeat music]
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:44.500]   (upbeat music)
