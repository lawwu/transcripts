[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Ironically, we're in a really weird time right now where they are deliberately
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.920]   trying to raise interest rates to keep house prices from going up, but what
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.480]   happens then is it makes it harder to build new property and it makes
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.020]   harder for people to buy property.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.200]   So where do all those people go?
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.880]   They go rent because they can't build a new property and they can't
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.440]   go and buy something, so they go and rent.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.800]   Well, we've already got housing deficit in America, a really bad one, which
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.060]   is why rents are going up so much.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.480]   So now we've got this increased problem.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.160]   The government is trying to slow down real estate prices and other prices
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.520]   from going up by raising interest rates, but what the effect it's having is
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.120]   it's driving rents higher and higher and higher, so who wins in that situation?
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.480]   Who wins when the rents are going up dramatically and people can't buy as
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.180]   much, flippers don't win because you can't sell a house when you're flipping
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.020]   houses as much, but when you own rental property and you have a fixed mortgage
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.400]   that does not change and your rents go up by 10%, 20% per year, it's the
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.720]   landlords, it's the rental property owners that are getting wealthier and wealthier and wealthier.
