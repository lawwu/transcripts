[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   What makes you the happiest?
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.160]   What are you after?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.840]   What's the one main thing that if you got it,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.900]   would make you the most joyful person
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.200]   for the longest amount of time?
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.320]   Every breathing human being on this planet
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.640]   is on a quest to find a fountain of joy.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.520]   The whole Bible assumes this quest
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.960]   and the Bible answers the quest too.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.040]   And to see how Pastor John has historically turned
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.920]   to a handful of key Bible texts,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.700]   particularly four of them, four go-to texts,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.080]   he mentions a lot, about 50 times now
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.800]   on this podcast to date.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.080]   And each is worth a close study.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.220]   It's worth writing out by hand into a journal,
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.800]   worth meditating on, even memorizing.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.240]   And those texts include Psalm 40, verse 16,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.000]   Psalm 70, verse four, Romans five, verse 11,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.520]   and First Peter three, 18.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.600]   Each of them in their own way says,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.420]   God is the prize of the gospel.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.040]   And it's two of these texts that came up
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.360]   in a very short video John Piper recorded in 2017.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.000]   I recently found it and pulled it to share it with you here.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.040]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.560]   - What's the deepest root of your joy?
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   What God gives to you or what God is for you?
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.700]   One way to get at that question in your own soul
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700]   is to ask, why did Jesus die and rise for me?
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.400]   And of course, there are glorious answers
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.680]   like he died to forgive my sins
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.040]   and to take away the wrath of God
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.960]   and to give me deliverance from hell
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.280]   and to give me imputed righteousness
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.400]   and to give me entrance into heaven
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.960]   and to cause my body to be raised from the dead
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.400]   and to give me entrance into the new heavens
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.600]   and the new earth and take away all my tears.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.560]   And that would be right and gloriously true
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.280]   and we should rejoice in it.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   But none of them is the ultimate reason for why he died.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.880]   First Peter three, 18 says,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.080]   Christ suffered the righteous for the unrighteous
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.080]   that he might bring us to God.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.320]   He died to bring us into fellowship with God
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   because in God's presence,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.360]   his fullness of joy at his right hand
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.080]   are pleasures forevermore
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   and all the other works of redemption are a means to that.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.040]   It says in Psalm 40 verse 16,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.480]   let those who love your salvation say continually,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.000]   great is the Lord.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.480]   It doesn't say let those who love your salvation
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.320]   say continually, great is your salvation,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.180]   but great is the Lord.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.000]   Of course, our salvation is great
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.800]   and we should love it as great.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.160]   But mainly our salvation is happening to us
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.720]   and all the gifts of God are coming to us
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.920]   in order that we might know God, love God,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.740]   treasure God, be satisfied in God.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.280]   So the biblical answer to the question,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.760]   what is my ultimate deepest source of joy?
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.120]   It's not his gifts.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   It's him known and enjoyed in and through his gifts.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.280]   - Amen.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   I especially love that Psalm 40, 16 text.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.800]   May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.200]   May those who love your salvation say continually,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.680]   great is the Lord.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   That's the point.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   To love salvation is to love and worship the saver,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.040]   the one who is the deepest root of our eternal joy,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.980]   the prize of the gospel.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.760]   Again, I would encourage you to study on your own
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.760]   those four texts I mentioned earlier, Psalm 40, 16.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.500]   Again, I just mentioned it.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.300]   And also Psalm 70 verse four,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.280]   Romans five verse 11 and first Peter 3, 18.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.520]   This was audio from a 2017 video titled,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.440]   what is the deepest root of your joy?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.200]   Christian hedonism in two minutes.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.080]   You just heard the entire thing,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.820]   but you can find the video online at desiringgod.org.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.720]   Thank you for joining us today.

[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.240]   So God is the prize of the gospel.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.200]   Amen.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   But he also lavishes on us all sorts of other created gifts
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   that are good and lawful and should be embraced
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.560]   with thanksgiving too.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.400]   And handling such gifts is not without challenges.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.840]   So when do our good gifts from God become vain?
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.940]   That's the question up next time.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.480]   I'm your host Tony Reinke,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.040]   and we'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.620]   (upbeat music)
