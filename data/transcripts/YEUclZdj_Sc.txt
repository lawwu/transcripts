[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I'd challenge the claim that Next Token Prediction cannot surpass human performance.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.500]   It looks like on the surface it cannot.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.620]   It looks on the surface if you just learn to imitate, to predict what people do it means
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.960]   that you can only copy people.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.740]   But here is a counter argument for why it might not be quite so if your neural net is,
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.820]   if your base neural net is smart enough.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.300]   You just ask it like what would a person with great insight and wisdom and capability do?
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.740]   Maybe such person doesn't exist, but there's a pretty good chance that the neural net will
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.940]   be able to extrapolate how such a person would behave.
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.620]   Do you see what I mean?
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.620]   Yes.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340]   Although where would it get that sort of insight about what that person would do, if not from?
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220]   From the data of regular people.
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.100]   Because if you think about it, what does it mean to predict the next token well enough?
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100]   What does it mean actually?
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.140]   It's a much, it's a deeper question than it seems.
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.660]   Predicting the next token well means that you understand the underlying reality that
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.280]   led to the creation of that token.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.220]   It's not statistics, like it is statistics, but what is statistics?
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.220]   In order to understand those statistics, to compress them, you need to understand what
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.660]   is it about the world that creates those statistics.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.580]   And so then you say, okay, well, I have all those people.
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.500]   What is it about people that creates their behaviors?
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.700]   Well, they have, you know, they have thoughts and they have feelings and they have ideas
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060]   and they do things in certain ways.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.100]   All of those would be deduced from next token prediction.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.800]   And I'd argue that this should make it possible, not indefinitely, but to a pretty decent degree
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.380]   to say, well, can you guess what you'd do if you took a person with like this characteristic
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.180]   and that characteristic, like such a person doesn't exist.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.780]   But because you're so good at predicting the next token, you should still be able to guess
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.660]   what that person would do, this hypothetical imaginary person with far greater mental ability
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.020]   than the rest of us.
