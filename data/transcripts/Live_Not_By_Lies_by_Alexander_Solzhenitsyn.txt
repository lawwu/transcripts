[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Today is July 4 and in the United States of America, this day is celebrated as Independence
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   Day, an anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence back in the late
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.400]   1700s. This day is of course filled with various fireworks and barbecues, etc. as is our cultural
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.300]   custom. But today I want to simply share with you an essay that I hope you'll consider and
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.200]   perhaps you've never heard or perhaps if you have, I hope you'll be reminded of the value
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.600]   of using your independence to simply speak, and to speak truth. Truthfulness is for me
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.100]   a very high value and I hope it is for you as well. It may be easy to tell a lie and
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.040]   to seek to enrich yourself by telling a lie, but it's always a bad bargain. Rather, simply
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.800]   committing yourself to not tell lies is something that will allow you to live a life of integrity
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.740]   with yourself and with others. Now this may cost you, after all the closing words of that
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.380]   Declaration of Independence was among the signers, "We mutually pledge to each other
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.000]   our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." But whatever else they did, those early signers
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.960]   of the Declaration of Independence did indeed put themselves on the line for what they believed.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.880]   So consider this particular essay. I hope it's encouraging to you and I hope you find
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.360]   it thought-provoking as you consider how to stand and how to speak truth in our current
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.260]   age.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.600]   Live Not by Lies by Alexander Solzhenitsyn Solzhenitsyn wrote this essay in 1974 and
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.920]   it circulated among Moscow's intellectuals at the time. It is dated February 12, which
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.000]   is the same day that secret police broke into his apartment and arrested him. The very next
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.300]   day he was exiled to West Germany.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.740]   Live Not by Lies by Alexander Solzhenitsyn At one time we dared not even to whisper.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.200]   Now we write and read some ease dot. And sometimes when we gather in the smoking room at the
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.160]   Science Institute we complain frankly to one another. What kind of tricks are they playing
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.680]   on us and where are they dragging us? Gratuitous boasting of cosmic achievements while there
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.440]   is poverty and destruction at home. Propping up remote uncivilized regimes. Fanning up
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.280]   civil war. And we recklessly foster Mao Tse-tung at our expense and it will be we who are sent
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.480]   to war against him and will have to go. Is there any way out? And they put on trial anybody
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.000]   they want and they put sane people in asylums. Always they. And we are powerless.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.200]   Things have almost reached rock bottom. A universal spiritual death has already touched
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.960]   us all, and physical death will soon flare up and consume us both and our children. But
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.840]   as before we still smile in a cowardly way and mumble without tongues tied. But what
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.320]   can we do to stop it? We haven't the strength. We have been so hopelessly dehumanized that
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.520]   for today's modest ration of food we are willing to abandon all our principles, our
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.360]   souls, and all the efforts of our predecessors and all opportunities for our descendants,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:34.800]   but just don't disturb our fragile existence. We lack staunchness, pride, and enthusiasm.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   We don't even fear universal nuclear death. And we don't fear a third world war. We have
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.600]   already taken refuge in the crevices. We just fear acts of civil courage. We fear only to
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.640]   lag behind the herd and to take a step alone and suddenly find ourselves without white
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.120]   bread, without heating gas, and without a Moscow registration. We have been indoctrinated
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.880]   in political courses and in just the same way was fostered the idea to live comfortably
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.200]   and all will be well for the rest of our lives. You can't escape your environment and social
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   conditions. Everyday life defines consciousness. What does it have to do with us? We can't
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.800]   do anything about it. But we can. Everything. But we lie to ourselves for assurance. And
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.040]   it is not they who are to blame for everything. We ourselves. Only we. One can object, but
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.520]   actually you can think anything you like. Gags have been stuffed into our mouths. Nobody
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.040]   wants to listen to us and nobody asks us. How can we force them to listen? It is impossible
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.560]   to change their minds. It would be natural to vote them out of office, but there are
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   not elections in our country. In the West, people know about strikes and protest demonstrations,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.880]   but we are too oppressed and it is a horrible prospect for us. How can one suddenly renounce
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.360]   a job and take to the streets? Yet the other fatal paths probed during the past century
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   by our bitter Russian history are nevertheless not for us, and truly we don't need them.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.820]   Now that the axes have done their work, when everything which was sown has sprouted anew,
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.280]   we can see that the young and presumptuous people who thought they would make our country
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:38.000]   just and happy through terror, bloody rebellion, and civil war were themselves misled. No thanks,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   fathers of education. Now we know that infamous methods breed infamous results. Let our hands
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   be clean. The circle, is it closed? And is there really no way out? And is there only
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.340]   one thing left for us to do, to wait without taking action? Maybe something will happen
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.940]   by itself. It will never happen as long as we daily acknowledge, extol, and strengthen,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.940]   and do not sever ourselves from the most perceptible of its aspects, lies. When violence intrudes
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.880]   into peaceful life, its face glows with self-confidence, as if it were carrying a banner and shouting,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.260]   "I am violence, run away, make way for me, I will crush you." But violence quickly
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.120]   grows old, and it has lost confidence in itself. And in order to maintain a respectable face,
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.680]   it summons falsehood as its ally. Since violence lays its ponderous paw, not every day and
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.760]   not on every shoulder, it demands from us only obedience to lies, and daily participation
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:50.540]   in lies. All loyalty lies in that. And the simplest and most accessible key to our self-neglected
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:07:00.220]   liberation lies right here, personal non-participation in lies. Though lies conceal everything, though
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:09.800]   lies embrace everything, but not with any help from me. This opens a breach in the imaginary
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   encirclement caused by our inaction. It is the easiest thing to do for us, but the most
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.480]   devastating for the lies. Because when people renounce lies, it simply cuts short their
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.720]   existence. Like an infection, they can exist only in a living organism. We do not exhort
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.680]   ourselves. We have not sufficiently matured to march into the squares and shout the truth
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.640]   out loud or to express aloud what we think. It's not necessary. It's dangerous. But
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:49.160]   it let us refuse to say that which we do not think. This is our path, the easiest and most
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.520]   accessible one, which takes into account our inherent cowardice, already well-rooted. And
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.680]   it is much easier, it's dangerous even to say this, than the sort of civil disobedience
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.880]   which Gandhi advocated. Our path is to talk away from the gangrenous boundary. If we did
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.460]   not paste together the dead bones and scales of ideology, if we did not sew together the
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.560]   rotting rags, we would be astonished how quickly the lies would be rendered helpless and subside.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.720]   That which should be naked would then really appear naked before the whole world. So in
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.840]   our timidity, let each of us make a choice. Whether consciously, to remain a servant of
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.260]   falsehood, of course it is not out of inclination, but to feed one's family that one raises his
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.640]   children in the spirit of lies, or to shrug off the lies and become an honest man, worthy
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:53.080]   of respect both by one's children and contemporaries. And from that day onward, he will not henceforth
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.960]   write, sign, or print in any way a single phrase which in his opinion distorts the truth.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.920]   Will utter such a phrase neither in private conversation nor in the presence of many people,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.120]   neither on his own behalf nor at the prompting of someone else, either in the role of agitator,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.520]   teacher, educator, not in a theatrical role. Will not depict, foster, or broadcast a single
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.720]   idea which he can only see as false, or a distortion of the truth whether it be in painting,
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:31.120]   sculpture, photography, technical science, or music. Will not cite, out of context, either
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.040]   orally or written, a single quotation so as to please someone, to feather his own nest,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.520]   to achieve success in his work if he does not share completely the idea which is quoted
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.660]   or if it does not accurately reflect the matter at issue. Will not allow himself to be compelled
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.680]   to attend demonstrations or meetings if they are contrary to his desire or will. Will neither
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.160]   take into hand nor raise into the air a poster or slogan which he does not completely accept.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.920]   Will not raise his hand to vote for a proposal with which he does not sincerely sympathize.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.280]   Will vote neither openly nor secretly for a person whom he considers unworthy or of
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.380]   doubtful abilities. Will not allow himself to be dragged to a meeting where there can
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.760]   be expected a forced or distorted discussion of a question. Will immediately talk out of
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.560]   a meeting, session, lecture, performance, or film showing if he hears a speaker tell
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:33.160]   lies or purvey ideological nonsense or shameless propaganda. Will not subscribe to or buy a
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.840]   newspaper or magazine in which information is distorted and primary facts are concealed.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.480]   Of course we have not listed all of the possible and necessary deviations from falsehood, but
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.120]   a person who purifies himself will easily distinguish from other instances with his
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:54.520]   purified outlook. No, it will not be the same for everybody at first. Some at first will
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.480]   lose their jobs. For young people who want to live with truth, this will in the beginning
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.240]   complicate their young lives very much because the required recitations are stuffed with
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.520]   lies and it is necessary to make a choice. But there are no loopholes for anybody who
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.800]   wants to be honest. On any given day, any one of us will be confronted with at least
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.280]   one of the above-mentioned choices, even in the most secure of the technical sciences,
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   either truth or falsehood, toward spiritual independence or toward spiritual servitude.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.720]   And he who is not sufficiently courageous even to defend his soul, don't let him be
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:38.080]   proud of his progressive views. Don't let him boast that he is an academician or a people's
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.120]   artist, a merited figure or a general. Let him say to himself, "I am in the herd and
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.880]   a coward. It's all the same to me as long as I'm fed and warm." Even this path, which
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:57.480]   is the most modest of all paths of resistance, will not be easy for us. But it is much easier
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   than self-immolation or a hunger strike. The flames will not envelop your body. Your eyeballs
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   will not burst from the heat and brown bread and clean water will always be available to
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.600]   your family. A great people of Europe, the Czechoslovaks, whom we betrayed and deceived,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.480]   haven't they shown us how a vulnerable breast can stand up even against tanks if there is
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.720]   a worthy heart within it? You say it will not be easy, but it will be easiest of all
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.080]   possible resources. It will not be an easy choice for a body, but it is the only one
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.960]   for a soul. No, it is not an easy path, but there are already people, even dozens of them,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.720]   who over the years have maintained all these points and live by the truth. So you will
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.880]   not be the first to take this path, but will join those who have already taken it. This
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.560]   path will be easier and shorter for all of us if we take it by mutual efforts and in
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.160]   close rank. If there are thousands of us, they will not be able to do anything with
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   us. If there are tens of thousands of us, then we would not even recognize our country.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.000]   If we are too frightened, then we should stop complaining that someone is suffocating us.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.520]   We ourselves are doing it. Let us then bow down even more. Let us wail, and our brothers
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.720]   the biologists will help to bring nearer the day when they are able to read our thoughts
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.440]   that are worthless and hopeless. And if we get cold feet, even taking this step, then
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:29.280]   we are worthless and hopeless, and the scorn of Pushkin should be directed to us. Why should
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.960]   cattle have the gifts of freedom? Their heritage from generation to generation is the belled
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   yoke and the lash.
