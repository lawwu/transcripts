[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   So today I wanna talk about digital distraction.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.360]   One of the big issues we face with our digital lives
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.840]   is the following dual reality.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.680]   On the one hand, we are not happy with our relationship
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.160]   with the type of digital content
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.720]   that's delivered through our phones.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.480]   We're spending too much time looking at it.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.520]   We don't love the quality of what we're looking at
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.880]   during all that time.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.600]   On the other hand, calls to step away
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.800]   from new and popular technologies can seem regressive
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.360]   or unsustainable.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.200]   I mean, what are we gonna do?
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.760]   Just pretend like phones don't exist,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.200]   like people did not ever invent social media.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.040]   So we're sort of trapped between both unhappiness
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.000]   and inevitability with distracting digital content.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.160]   So what I wanna do today is offer an interesting new way
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.560]   to think about and navigate these challenges.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.760]   At the core of this new way
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.960]   is going to be an analogy about food.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.640]   So this is actually based off of a newsletter article
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.440]   I published a couple of weeks ago.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.200]   So you can also find the article at calnewport.com/blog,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.240]   or if you subscribe, check your newsletter.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.080]   All right, so I opened up this essay
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.440]   and I wanna open up this discussion
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.240]   with something I noticed when I was in London
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.320]   a few weeks ago.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.920]   There was a big marketing push going on
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.940]   when I was in London for the paperback edition
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.240]   of Chris Van Toleken's big UK bestseller,
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.520]   Ultra-Processed People.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   Why do we all eat stuff that isn't food
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.200]   and why can't we stop?
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.840]   So this was in all of the bookstores
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.000]   that I could see in London
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.480]   and I went to a lot of bookstores in London
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.520]   because you know me, that's the type of thing I do.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.640]   All right, so I had to find out more about this.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440]   I ended up looking at the book
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   and I discovered this term ultra-processed food,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.920]   which is at the core of Van Toleken's book
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.320]   is a term coined in 2009
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.960]   as part of a new food classification system
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560]   and it was inspired by Michael Pollan's concept
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.480]   of edible food-like substances,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   which he talks about in his book, In Defense of Food.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.880]   So ultra-processed foods are made
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.920]   by breaking down real food
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.600]   to their organic building blocks.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.940]   You might take soy, you might take corn
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.200]   and break it down into these organic building blocks
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.580]   and then you reconstitute new fake food
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.400]   from these organic building blocks
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.120]   that you fill with a lot of sugar
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.440]   and salt and fat and you soak in all sorts
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.880]   of other types of chemicals to make them shelf-sable
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.480]   or to have the right mouthfeel
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.760]   and you end up with these, as Pollan would call them,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.480]   edible food-like substances
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.000]   that are not like any real food that exists,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.600]   but they're hyper-palatable.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.960]   Once you start eating them, you can't stop to eat,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.660]   which is a problem because they're highly caloric
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.500]   and they're junk.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.100]   Like they're made from base building blocks
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.880]   and full of salt and full of fat.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.480]   So very bad for us.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.540]   This book was all about how ultra-processed foods
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.200]   is very profitable, is very bad for us.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.600]   We should basically avoid them
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.080]   and it's causing huge amounts of problems
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.320]   in our current health system.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.840]   So once I learned about this,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.280]   this made me think a little bit about our problems
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.180]   with digital content.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.040]   I began to come up with what I think is a useful analogy
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.820]   between digital content and the way we think about food.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.400]   So I'm gonna bring up a diagram here
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.040]   for those who are watching as opposed to just listening.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.760]   Jesse, people will be disappointed to see
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.320]   that I actually pre-typed out the words here
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.000]   so you don't get to see me actually
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.320]   write by hand the words,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.760]   which looks roughly as you would expect
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.620]   if you tried to teach writing to an inebriated chimpanzee.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.740]   I would say that's roughly what my handwriting looks like
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.580]   when I try to write on screen.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.420]   So I typed this out.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.960]   Instead, I'm making a bit of like a food pyramid here.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.620]   And what I'm gonna do is analogize types of food,
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.060]   starting with minimally processed,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.440]   moving up to moderately processed
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.760]   and ending with ultra-processed.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.360]   So the food hierarchy that nutritionists use right now,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.660]   I'm going to analogize these to types of technology.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.680]   And we're gonna find this in the end to be useful
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.700]   for how to think about the most distracting of technologies.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.120]   So at the bottom of this pyramid,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.960]   we have minimally processed.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.760]   So for food, minimally processed food
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.720]   is gonna describe things like whole foods, right?
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.480]   So it's an apple, it's a broccoli
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.600]   or something like this, right?
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   We can make a connection between minimally processed foods
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.280]   and printed linguistic media, right?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.640]   So I'm starting to make a connection now
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.120]   to types of foods and types of media.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.560]   So I'll draw this on here now,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.400]   but when it comes to minimally processed,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   let's think about things like books, linguistic media.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.880]   This is a type of media that's been around for a long time,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.120]   at least 5,000 years,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.460]   not enough time for a lot of brain evolution,
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.280]   but plenty of time for cultural evolution.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.000]   We've sort of, our culture has evolved
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.800]   along with written media like books.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.900]   We sort of have, we know how to deal with them.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.440]   Our mind knows how to handle them.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.620]   There's a lot of quality in written media.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.780]   So I think about our media equivalent
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.900]   to minimally processed food
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.440]   is gonna be linguistic media like books.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.300]   Then we move up to moderately processed food.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.540]   All right, in the world of food,
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.500]   this is where we get things like white bread,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   dry pasta, and canned soups, all right?
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.220]   When these came along, we're like, okay,
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.900]   these are, they're more convenient
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.460]   than minimally processed food.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.120]   They don't require as much prep,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.540]   but they tend to be higher calories,
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.700]   maybe a little less quality.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.980]   It's easy to maybe eat a little bit too much.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.980]   And so, you know, we thought about
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.520]   moderately processed food with some care.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.440]   Well, I'm gonna draw a media analogy
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.020]   from moderately processed food to mass media.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.320]   Right, so you put mass there.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.620]   It's like television, like radio.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.020]   I'm also gonna put,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.500]   I'm putting web two here.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.580]   That's not quite right, but what I mean by this,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.480]   I'm gonna mean things like email newsletters and podcasts.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.260]   So it's user-generated content,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.380]   but not super curated,
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.980]   a little higher quality than like a comment on a post
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.220]   or something like this.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.820]   So that sort of older early web two version
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.660]   of user-generated content,
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.020]   sort of like high quality, low barrier to entry,
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.020]   but hard to find, hard to curate.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.660]   Like I have to be convinced
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.900]   to subscribe to an email newsletter.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.060]   I have to be convinced to subscribe to a podcast.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.580]   And then we have the ultra processed food at the top,
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.700]   which is more recent.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.740]   And when it comes to media,
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.900]   I'm gonna analogize this to social content.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.220]   So I'll put social media.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.420]   It's a useful analogy,
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.740]   minimally processed, moderately processed, ultra processed.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.940]   Now here's the thing, when it comes to food,
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.220]   we know how to deal with each of these levels.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.620]   The advice is pretty straightforward.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.580]   You can eat, don't worry about minimally processed food.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.100]   Go ahead and eat what you want to eat.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.460]   When it comes to moderately processed food, have moderation.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.780]   You don't have to avoid it, but be careful about it.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.700]   It's very palatable, it's easier.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.580]   Be careful about eating too much of it.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.980]   And for ultra processed food, as we now know,
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.060]   eat sparingly.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.980]   In fact, avoid it altogether if you can.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.340]   You don't necessarily need that in your lives.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.180]   We could have similar advice for the corresponding media.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.180]   So when we go to the minimally processed level
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.300]   and we get printed linguistic communication like books,
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.620]   as much as you want to read, it's great.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.060]   Consume as many books as you want.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.300]   No limit.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.420]   Read, read, read.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.780]   We're not worried about it.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.380]   When it comes to the moderately processed media,
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.660]   so now mass media like television or online streaming shows
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.660]   or podcasts or email newsletters, have some moderation
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.500]   and maybe look for the higher quality spectrum
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.380]   of these things, right?
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.940]   Like the same way we deal with moderately processed food.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.740]   So what might that mean for media?
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.580]   That might mean, for example, schedule.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.540]   If you're gonna watch TV shows, be like, yeah, at night,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.460]   I'm gonna watch for like this 90 minutes
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.620]   and here's what I'm gonna watch.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.180]   And I chose something that's pretty good,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.260]   pretty high quality, right?
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.300]   As opposed to I just default to watching stuff
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.020]   and I'll binge for hours at a time.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.780]   When it comes to something like email newsletters,
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.820]   it's fine to read them.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.460]   I think email newsletters are great.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.020]   You don't want them to be a portal to other distractions,
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.380]   just like you don't want processed food
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.900]   to be the portal to binge eating.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.820]   So maybe use one of these clipping services.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.940]   Someone was telling me the other day
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.100]   about a really cool service.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.700]   One of the listeners emailed me about this,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.220]   where you can send articles or email newsletters
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.700]   to your Kindle.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.620]   There's you like press a button,
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.140]   it shoots it to your Kindle.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.620]   So you can kind of shoot stuff to the Kindle
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.460]   throughout the day.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.980]   And then later you're like, I'm gonna go sit on the porch
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.140]   or at like the beer garden at the local whatever.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.100]   And I'm gonna read these, like I have five articles
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.900]   I found that it's like on my Kindle.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.860]   So it's not distracting.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.260]   There's no portals to other types of distraction.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.060]   Same thing, podcast, it's fine.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.740]   Like to listen to these while you're doing other things.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.980]   Just make sure, for example,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.460]   that you have a regular dose of vitamin boredom.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.300]   We talk about this in my book, "Digital Minimalism."
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.540]   You wanna make sure that you don't take all solitude
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.380]   out of your day.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.900]   So as long as every day you have a little bit of time
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.740]   where you're doing something boring
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.700]   with nothing in your ear,
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.000]   and every week you have an extended amount of time
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.100]   where you're doing something boring,
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.780]   like going on a long walk without something in your ear,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.620]   you should be fine.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.780]   Otherwise, yeah, you can listen to podcasts.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.740]   So we can have these like reasonable rules.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.580]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.500]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.540]   that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.740]   then you need to check out my new book,
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.540]   "Slow Productivity,
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.420]   "The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.120]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.860]   we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.860]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.900]   I know you're gonna like it.
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.940]   Check it out.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.260]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.380]   Here's where things get interesting.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.660]   When we move up to the ultra-processed level,
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.460]   what do we say about ultra-processed food?
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.600]   Avoid that stuff.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.340]   Why don't we say something similar
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.720]   about ultra-processed content like social media content?
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Like, yeah, use that sparingly,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.380]   and if possible, actually,
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.220]   you probably just want to avoid that.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.180]   Now, I want to make this,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.880]   I mean, this is kind of the key of the discussion here.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.520]   I want to make this analogy much more precise
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.460]   when it comes to ultra-processed food and social media,
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.540]   'cause I want to convince you
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.460]   that the way we deal with ultra-processed food
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.700]   is a perfectly reasonable way
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.340]   to think about ultra-processed content
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.780]   like social media content, all right?
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.860]   So here's the thing about ultra-processed food.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.220]   We talked about how they build things down
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.820]   to the building blocks and then recombine
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.820]   and build these fake foods that are highly appealing.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.860]   Something similar is happening
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.300]   with social media content, right?
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.060]   It's not just some vague notion of, like, it's addictive.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.700]   Something very similar is happening.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.700]   So let me get more specific about this, okay?
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.860]   In fact, I'm going to draw this here.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.520]   So let me go to a clean screen.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.220]   All right, I'm going to draw this visually.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.940]   There is a loop that happens
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.460]   when it comes to social content
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.340]   that I think makes this analogy to ultra-processed food
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.260]   more than just a very rough analogy.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.700]   So here's the current loop for social media content.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.700]   We start with, I'm drawing sort of like a blue box here.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.600]   All right, so Jesse, this is a pool, all right?
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.480]   Why do I have a pool here?
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.040]   Because this is what we start with
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.880]   is in the feedback loop for social content.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.960]   You start with a pool of user-produced content
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.920]   that's very large.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.560]   Lots of people are posting content
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.740]   on TikTok, on Instagram, whatever it is.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.520]   All right, this then is going to move along the cycle
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.960]   and we are going to have recommendation algorithms.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.840]   So, you know, there's a computer involved.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.220]   So I'll draw my world-famous computer drawing.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.440]   All right, so we have a computer involved, right?
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   So then we have recommendation algorithms
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.880]   that selects among this very large pool of content
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.160]   to figure out what to show you, the user.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.360]   So I'll put the user is over here.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.540]   All right, and then whether you like it or not,
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.360]   then that feedback makes it back
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.000]   to the producers of the content for the pool, right?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.400]   So now you're getting this feedback.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.560]   A lot of people viewed it.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.760]   Not very many people viewed it.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.680]   This got a lot of likes.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.600]   This not get a lot of likes.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   This got a viral lift.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.800]   This other thing did not get a viral lift.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.560]   So that then affects how you produce your content
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.000]   so that it better serves the out,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.360]   better works with the algorithm
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.320]   and the taste of the users and on and on and on.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.500]   The output of this, the effect of all of this
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.160]   is something like what food scientists do
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.240]   with ultra-processed food.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.440]   So the producers of content in this,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.400]   constantly getting this feedback
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   about algorithmically mediated consumption,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.040]   constantly adjusting what they're doing,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.520]   end up, and this is the cycle
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.880]   of almost any large-scale social platform,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   end up basically breaking down media content as we know it
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.800]   into its base building blocks
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.240]   and then reconstructing them into these forms
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.160]   that have never existed before,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.340]   but are hyper-palatable to these very specific dyads
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.780]   between recommendation algorithms
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.960]   and the particular consumption habits of consumers
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.900]   that they're trying to get their media to.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.460]   The result is frankenfood, but in media form.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.300]   So this is why we see really unusual
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.420]   types of content forms suddenly begin to proliferate
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.260]   on these platforms.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.820]   It's this feedback loop.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   And this is very similar to what the food scientists do.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   I'm gonna read a quote from my article on this
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.580]   that gets to the heart of this.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.940]   "In this way, the users of social media platforms
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.080]   "simulate something like the food scientist's ability
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.520]   "to break down corn and reconstitute it
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.260]   "into a hyper-palatable edible food-like substance.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.260]   "What is a TikTok dance mashup, if not a digital Dorito?"
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.100]   All right, so if we go back to this, we're like, okay,
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.620]   this connection between ultra-processed food
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.040]   and social content is not just a lazy analogy.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.560]   It's very similar.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.100]   And so for the same reasons we say,
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.820]   why don't we just avoid ultra-processed food
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.300]   because we will consume a ton of Inez crap,
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.260]   we could say the same thing about social media content.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.780]   Now, here's why it's really, I think, useful
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.780]   to think about this through this analogous form
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.140]   is that we are comfortable with that food advice.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.100]   No one says, if you come out and say,
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.740]   you know what, ultra-processed food,
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.360]   for all these reasons, you should avoid it.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.880]   No one comes out and says, whoa, you're anti-food.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.120]   No one says that.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.240]   No one comes out and says, when you're like, look,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   just, I would not eat Doritos and Oreos,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.560]   and this is not real food, and it's weird,
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.600]   it messes with your mind.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.300]   No one will say, hey, Luddite,
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.400]   this is the inevitable progress of food technology,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.480]   don't get in the way of it.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.160]   No one will say, when you push back
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.800]   on ultra-processed foods, well,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.320]   that's just because you're older.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.480]   The kids, see, this was invented,
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.520]   Fruit Roll-Ups were invented when we were kids.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.100]   We don't say to our parents' generations,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.800]   well, look, the kids are just more up on more newer foods,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   and you're just being old-fashioned
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.560]   and are scared of what's new.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.540]   No, we say, this particular type of food
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.280]   is built in a lab by scientists
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.400]   so that we'll buy a lot of it, and it's very expensive,
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.980]   and it's really bad for us, let's just avoid that.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.200]   So when we make this analogy to content,
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.840]   we realize, oh, it's possible to be more selective
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.600]   about digital content without having to be accused
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.680]   of being anti-technology, without having to be accused
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.960]   of ignoring the inevitable progress of technology,
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.480]   without having to be accused of being
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.680]   a sort of kids-these-days codger on their porch
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.600]   trying to yell at the stuff
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.280]   that the young people find natural.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   We can instead say, there's all sorts of media content,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.960]   we can be savvy about how we approach it
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.760]   and read a bunch of books,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.720]   have some more structure and moderation
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.040]   about stuff like TV and streaming and podcasts,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.760]   and then stay away from the digital Doritos.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.280]   It's completely compatible
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.680]   with a healthy media consumption diet.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.920]   So that's why I found this analogy to food really useful,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.680]   because it helped me see how strange and unusual
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.520]   and eccentric and narrow and specific
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.920]   social media content is.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.200]   And when I see it as ultra-processed food,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.160]   I can recognize it's high-tech,
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.720]   I can recognize a lot of advances
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.440]   were needed to make this possible,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.320]   and I can also say, I don't want any of that on my plate.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.120]   And so this analogy gives us a way
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.360]   of stepping away from the stuff that's making us unhappy
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.600]   without somehow feeling like we're doing something radical.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.480]   If you're okay without eating
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.400]   Lay's potato chips every day,
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.320]   it's really not that much different to say,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.280]   I don't use Instagram every day.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.000]   All right, so that food analogy I find useful.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.240]   That there is something exceptional and unusual
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.520]   and not somehow teleological
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.360]   built into the future of the internet
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.440]   with a lot of this stuff that's happening with social media.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   It's not the future of the internet, it's food science.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.040]   It's we've made Snickers bars irresistible, you know?
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.280]   And when I see it that way, I'm like, okay, not for me.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.740]   And hopefully we don't have to see that anymore
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.240]   as being some sort of weird, unusual stance.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.020]   All right, so I don't know, Jesse, ultra-processed content,
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.760]   it doesn't have to be a big political statement
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.360]   not to consume it.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.840]   - The one thing I think you want to think about
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.480]   is most grocery stores you go into,
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.160]   the middle of the store is basically moderate
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.080]   to ultra-processed food, right?
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.840]   So it's pretty hard to avoid.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.360]   You have to really know to stay on the outskirts
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.520]   of the grocery store.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.220]   - So what's the phone equivalent?
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.800]   It's like you want something about apps on your phone
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.600]   or something like this, the middle of your phone
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.360]   versus the outskirts of your phone.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.240]   Yeah, I know, it's the same thing.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   There's a lot of pressures going into making you,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.640]   so the store puts it right up front and center,
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.440]   and in our cultural lives, people just keep talking about
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.840]   the stuff that's being spread around it.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.880]   - And you go in the app store, the most popular apps
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.160]   are probably some of those social media apps
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.400]   that you see and people buy.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.080]   - And cultural stories are happening there.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.240]   But do you buy this analysis, Jesse?
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.340]   It seems to me, before, and even maybe
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.460]   when we started the show, but certainly a few years
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.460]   before that, the talk about social media content,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.080]   the way I'm talking about it now,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.980]   is this was this weird profit-seeking diversion
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.060]   from the internet that got really big,
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.200]   but it's really not good for us,
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.000]   and we can kind of move on without it.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.680]   That used to be crazy talk, right?
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.980]   I mean, people are like, "What are you talking about?
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.660]   "That is the internet.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.200]   "This is what the internet is supposed to be."
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.760]   It doesn't feel like crazy talk as much anymore.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.200]   So now I'm really trying to give people
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.840]   vocabulary and ways of thinking about,
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.440]   yeah, all you're doing is saying no to Doritos.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.000]   This is not some anti-technology stance.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.240]   It's not even a major stance.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.440]   No one is going to think twice
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.600]   if you don't have the craziest of junk food in your house,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.800]   like the stuff we had growing up.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.840]   Do you remember Dunkaroos?
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.680]   - Kind of.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.500]   - Right?
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.020]   It's not TikTok Dunkaroos.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   Dunkaroos was cookies shaped like kangaroos
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.320]   and a bowl of chocolate packaged up with chemicals
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.860]   so it could stay shelf-stable for whatever,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.320]   and you would dip the cookie in the chocolate.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.160]   That's what our generation was told.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.800]   I mean, is that not like the current generation and TikTok?
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.840]   Like, yeah, this is just like what you do on the internet.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.560]   We ate Dunkaroos and had fruit by the foot.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.400]   Remember that?
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.220]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.060]   - You'd pull it out.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.520]   Yeah, and now we're like, "Oh, that was basically poison."
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.780]   I mean, I think that's how we're gonna see this current age
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.600]   of like, "Of course I'm scrolling these videos of people."
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   It's the weird hyper-palatable
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.200]   but foreignness of social content.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.600]   Just like on, so on TikTok, it's these weird visual forms.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.440]   That's just weird.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.540]   It's not the way we've ever seen content before,
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.600]   but it just works right.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.380]   On Twitter, I really think it's more,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.780]   I mean, it's text, but it's more about this weird
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.560]   sort of hyper-argumentative tribal sort of cynical warfare.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.400]   Like, it's this tone that has evolved to be like,
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.160]   "This is the Dunkaroos of like text posting."
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.000]   You know?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.120]   Instagram, I don't know it well,
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.240]   but you get these weird visual niche cultures
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   of like the mom blogger in the white linen,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.360]   wind-bappled, blowing dresses.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.740]   He brings her kids to collect wildflowers to put in jars.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.720]   And with guys, it's like the muscles and the, you know,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.560]   I don't know what you're doing,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.880]   like lifting heavy things by private jet.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.120]   There's these weird like visual languages
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.480]   that have this kind of compulsion.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.120]   YouTube can get this like Mr. Beast style editing rhythm
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.480]   that's like unlike anything else that existed before,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.600]   but it's this feedback loop.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   It's just breaking stuff down and reconstituting
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.760]   the way that like works well in these algorithm human diets.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.240]   So anyways, we don't need it.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.280]   We don't need ultra processed content.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.480]   Or if we do, eat sparingly.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.280]   And don't feel like somehow this has to be
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.600]   at the core of your diet.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.920]   I guess we're stretching this analogy pretty far, but.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.960]   - I love the term digital Dorito.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.360]   - I mean, that's TikTok, it's digital Dorito.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.340]   All right, so we've got some questions,
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.400]   a lot of questions on people struggling with tech
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.520]   and distraction and trying to build a more meaningful life.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.360]   Excited about those.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   But first, let's hear briefly from a sponsor.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   All right, this show is sponsored by Better Help.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.080]   So we were just talking about
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.980]   all of this ultra processed content.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.280]   Well, one of the things that can make you do
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.360]   is feel really bad.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.280]   You know, you're seeing all this weird stuff.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.720]   It's shallow, it's lower quality.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.200]   It gets you in your head and you feel bad.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.320]   Now, if you're already struggling
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.980]   with what's going on inside your own head,
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.760]   the way you feel about yourself or the world,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.800]   dealing with ruminations, dealing with anhedonia,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   all of these things,
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.640]   ultra processed content is only gonna make that worse.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.400]   So step one, let's cut out the ultra processed content.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.720]   Step two, let's get some professional help.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.900]   If you are unhappy still with this relationship
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.140]   within your head, that's where Better Help enters the scene.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.200]   If you're thinking of starting therapy,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.440]   Better Help is a great way to get started.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.920]   Why? Because it's entirely online.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.760]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.200]   and suited to your schedule.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.180]   All you do is fill out a brief questionnaire
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.200]   and you will get matched with a licensed therapist.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.160]   And if you don't like the therapist,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   you can switch at any time for no additional charge.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.960]   So the barrier between you right now
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.540]   and getting some professional help
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.360]   repairing your relationship with your own brain
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.380]   is very small when you use Better Help.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.960]   So stop comparing or floundering
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.440]   with your ultra processed content
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.640]   or feeling bad inside your head
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.880]   and start focusing with Better Help.

[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.640]   Following this along on this medical theme,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.760]   I also wanna talk about our longtime sponsor, ZocDoc,
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.100]   a free app and website where you can search and compare
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.880]   highly rated in-network doctors near you
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.780]   and instantly book appointments with them online.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.660]   This is the right way to find healthcare providers.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.880]   You say, okay, I'm looking for this type
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.320]   of healthcare provider, let me start narrowing my search.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   I want one nearby.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.680]   I want one that takes my insurance.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.840]   I want one who's taking new patients.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.360]   Let me look at these, great.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   Now let me look at the reviews in the ZocDoc app
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.400]   or on the ZocDoc website.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.460]   So I can see, what do people think?
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.800]   Oh, they really like this doctor.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.940]   They really like the service, this doctor's office, great.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.840]   Now let me book my first appointment.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.880]   Oh, I'll likely be able to do that online
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.160]   straight from the app or website as well.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.440]   It really just makes sense.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.740]   It is the right way to find healthcare providers
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.800]   when you need them.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.360]   The typical wait time to see a doctor booked on ZocDoc
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.600]   is only between 24 and 72 hours, that's it.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.640]   There are even some same day appointments.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.720]   You could, whatever that problem is,
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.680]   stop procrastinating and get the ZocDoc app.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.300]   It is also an excuse to use the phrase ZocDoc all the time.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.560]   People can say, where'd you find that doctor?
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.380]   And you say, oh, ZocDoc.com.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.280]   Your doctor could ask you, how did you find out about me?
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.840]   And you could say, hey doc, ZocDoc.com
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.800]   is how I got the scoop on the doc.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.400]   That's not quite right, Jesse, let's see.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.560]   Doc, hey doc, ZocDoc.com.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.720]   And if you looked it up on the doc,
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.680]   if you use the app on a doc
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.360]   and your doctor asks you how you heard about them,
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.180]   you say, hey doc, ZocDoc.com on the doc, et cetera.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:05.780]   All right, so anyways, ZocDoc is great.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.360]   I have used ZocDoc.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.880]   I have used it to find healthcare providers.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.360]   I also have healthcare providers who use it.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.200]   And so like I can do the paperwork for them online
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.920]   using ZocDoc and it makes them easier.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.240]   So it is a part of my life too.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.500]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.320]   and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.440]   You can find a book, a top rated doctor today.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.120]   Do you remember, Jesse, when we had that competition
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.600]   and people would send in the best ZocDoc taglines?
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.440]   - Yeah. - Like who could have
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.520]   like the longest collection describing,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.920]   so they had the longest collection of things
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.820]   that rhymed with doc or Zoc and got pretty good.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.800]   - Yeah, in the early days too,
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.360]   you used to talk a lot about Greek mythology.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.480]   - I know, I know.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.460]   We did elaborate ZocDoc reads
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.800]   and talked a lot about Greek mythology.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.400]   And we also, it's funny, the reporter or the photographer
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.460]   who was here today was like, why is there a skeleton?
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.960]   Why is there a skeleton in your office?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.640]   And I had to explain to them Jesse's skeleton.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.360]   And this is true story, as I was explaining that,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.720]   I could see the reporter just ripping the pages
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.600]   from the interview out of his notebook
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.720]   and just crumpling them up
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.980]   and putting them in the garbage can.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.680]   Just, the more I explained about Jesse's skeleton,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.160]   the more I could see, and you know, it was weird.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.440]   The photographer actually just was pulling
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.520]   the film out of his camera.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.880]   I mean, it felt a little aggressively unnecessary.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.360]   He was like, uh-huh, uh-huh, just exposing it to light,
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.800]   just like clearly ruining it.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.720]   Now, the article is going to be
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.400]   the full page picture, Jesse's skeleton,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.880]   and that's going to be like the focus of it.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.980]   All right, that's enough of this nonsense.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.320]   Let's do some questions.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.800]   All right, who do we have?
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   - All right, first question's from Ben.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.360]   How would you update your book, "How to Win a College,"
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.600]   adapted to the challenges of modern day tech,
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.700]   distractibility, email nonsense, et cetera?
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.380]   Are there new rules you would add?
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.940]   How might you update some of the old rules?
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.720]   - Well, certainly, "How to Win a College"
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.800]   and "How to Become a Straight-A Student"
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.460]   were written in a different time.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:21.360]   When I went to college, I arrived without a cell phone
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.120]   and without a laptop.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.440]   I ended up with both of those things by the time I left,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.200]   but that wasn't necessarily normal.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.440]   I had the laptop because I was doing some
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.760]   computer programming for an optical film company
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.160]   that was sort of one of my jobs to make money,
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.200]   and I had the cell phone because of my business,
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.400]   but it was a different time for sure.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.640]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.020]   So if you read those books,
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.920]   there's not a lot of talk about digital distraction.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.380]   It just wasn't a big part of college life.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.260]   There was a time where I thought about
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.420]   doing a revised version of
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.260]   "How to Become a Straight-A Student" in particular,
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.080]   'cause that's the book that has the most
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.500]   sort of hardcore study advice.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.980]   So I thought about doing that,
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.420]   and we actually talked to the publisher about it at the time,
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.260]   and it sort of fell through.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.360]   I wanted to do a big revised edition,
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.300]   and they didn't really wanna pay a lot of money,
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.140]   and I was like, "Well, I don't know why.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.300]   "I don't wanna just do this on spec."
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.600]   And so we kind of let it drop.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.380]   Now, years later, that was years ago,
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.460]   years later, I'm kind of glad
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.340]   that the book just exists at this moment of time
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.140]   right before this big digital revolution,
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.020]   because it almost gives it a sort of historical feel,
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.380]   like you're getting wisdom from a time past.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.600]   I think actually somehow it helps it.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.740]   Like if I had updated this book
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.420]   to be relevant to like circa 2013,
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.060]   it's just gonna seem dated in a weird way.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.780]   So I kinda like right now that the book
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.460]   just exists at this pre,
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.780]   you see like how did people study
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.780]   back before there was things like smartphones,
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.900]   and you can get some inspiration out of it.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.380]   But what do I tell people today?
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.700]   Like what advice would I change for students?
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.100]   Well, I would say more than ever before,
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.300]   your mind is your greatest tool and differentiator.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.500]   Most of your peers are very distracted,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.820]   and this is reducing both the quality
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.380]   of what they're able to produce with their mind,
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.260]   but more importantly, the time it requires them
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.860]   to produce this work.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.420]   So if you explicitly cultivate
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.460]   your ability to concentrate,
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.460]   you are gonna have a huge competitive advantage.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.460]   I didn't have access to that advantage
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.900]   in the early 2000s,
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.620]   'cause people weren't nearly as distracted
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.580]   as they are today.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.380]   So there's a huge advance there.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.220]   A couple of ways to do that.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.620]   Never study with your phone.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.280]   Leave your phone in your dorm,
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.520]   go somewhere else to study.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.940]   It's like the number one thing I tell the modern students.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.100]   Your friends will survive not being in touch with you
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.360]   for a couple hours, they'll get used to it.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.020]   Do not have your phone with you.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.540]   Turn the internet off on your laptop
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.860]   if you're using your laptop.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.300]   Force yourself to study disconnected.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.220]   This will mean at first
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.260]   that your study sessions are shorter, that's fine.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.460]   20 minutes and then you can go use the public computer,
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.340]   or 20 minutes and you go back and get your phone
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.140]   and then come back and do another 20 minutes.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.100]   As you get more comfortable,
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.060]   you can make that 30 minutes, then 40 minutes,
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.140]   and eventually you wanna be able to do 90 minutes
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.200]   to two hours fully disconnected.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.060]   Studying disconnected.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.260]   Really disconnected.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.640]   Not trying to not look at your phone,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.500]   but really disconnected.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.700]   Night and day difference than studying with connectivity.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.980]   The contact shifting is just not there.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.700]   It will feel uncomfortable,
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.780]   but your brain is gonna be like
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.740]   you're on the limitless pill.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.060]   At least as compared to what it's like
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.420]   when you have to keep glancing at unrelated text messages,
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.340]   social media, and internet posts.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.220]   So study without the internet.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.440]   Don't even have your phone in the same building
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.140]   as where you're studying.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.900]   Embrace boredom on a regular basis.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.240]   Get used to walking between classes,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.280]   going and getting lunch,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.240]   without putting anything in your ear
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.460]   or anything in front of your eyes.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.600]   You don't have to be bored all the time,
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.040]   but you have to be very comfortable
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.360]   with being alone with your own thoughts.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.480]   Because what is studying?
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.720]   What is trying to write?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.360]   What is trying to come up with something original on a test?
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.280]   You alone with your own thoughts, making sense of them.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.680]   You have to be comfortable
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.120]   with your interior cognitive space.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.780]   So practice that specifically.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.240]   Outside of studying,
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.280]   practice just being alone with your own thoughts.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.100]   Do it at least once every day.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.860]   I would recommend do not use ultra-processed content.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.740]   You don't need to be on TikTok.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.620]   It's not, it's very popular among college kids,
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.880]   but it's not, from what I understand
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.100]   from the course I taught last summer,
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.180]   it's not like heavily integrated
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.420]   into your social interactions.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.860]   Don't use TikTok.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.960]   Don't use Instagram.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.460]   Don't be super plugged
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.500]   into the ultra-processed content world.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.420]   'Cause look, you're a cognitive athlete
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.240]   when you're in college.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.500]   You're trying to make your way to the majors.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.660]   The baseball analogy would be,
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.240]   college is like you're in A-ball.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.640]   You're trying to get up to speed,
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.660]   learn how to hit a major league fastball,
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.620]   get in shape so you have a shot at the majors.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.380]   When you're in A-ball as a baseball player,
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.900]   you're not gonna eat a bunch of junk food.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.280]   Well, when you're in cognitive A-ball,
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.660]   don't consume a bunch of junk media.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.860]   So be very wary about ultra-processed content.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.880]   People might think it's weird at first you're not doing that,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.820]   but actually it will probably differentiate you later
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.580]   from someone who's interesting.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.520]   And read as much as you can.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.860]   Outside of your school assignments,
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.300]   read, read, read, read.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.140]   This is gonna be the equivalent of just jogging
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.580]   and doing a lot of pull-ups as an athlete.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.700]   It's really important.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.660]   All right, so I'll do a quick summary
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.360]   of everything I just said.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.940]   Your mind's your greatest tool.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.180]   There's never been a bigger chance
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.360]   for you to have a comparative advantage
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.820]   compared to your peers.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.020]   So let's take it seriously.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   How do we do that?
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.580]   Study with your phone in a different building
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.500]   and the internet turned off.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.460]   Full no exceptions.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.260]   Studying is disconnected.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.080]   Don't give me this.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.980]   I have to go to the internet to get access to my,
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.420]   access to materials on the internet first.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.540]   Download it, print it,
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.020]   and then go somewhere and study from it.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.480]   I don't like these exceptions of like once, three years ago.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.940]   There was a teacher who had a program for flashcards
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.380]   that you had to go to the web to use it.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.620]   Therefore, I shall forevermore be fully connected
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.980]   to 17 social services and text messaging while I study.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.300]   I get that so much from kids.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.660]   What if my homework, my homework's online?
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.720]   I have to, it's online.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.880]   So I must be on TikTok.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.020]   Come on, download your work.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.340]   All right.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.780]   Embrace boredom every day.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.040]   Don't use ultra process content if at all possible
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.300]   and read as much as you can.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.140]   All right, so that's my,
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.380]   those are my missing chapters, Jesse.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.820]   Who do we got next?
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.060]   - All right, next question is from Gemma.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.500]   I have no social media.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.780]   I don't have a smartphone.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.780]   However, I'm obsessed with my work.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.140]   As I'm young and without a family,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.720]   I can craft my own work schedule.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.380]   However, I eventually want to meet someone
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.260]   and start a family.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.080]   How can I bring more balance in my life
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.820]   and not be addicted to my work?
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.860]   - Well, this is where, you know,
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.900]   I recommend lifestyle-centric planning, right?
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.860]   And so before I get into what lifestyle-centric planning is,
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.780]   which I'll do briefly because I talk about it a lot,
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.480]   let's just remind ourselves of what the opposite is.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.840]   What is the preferred alternative approach
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.100]   to lifestyle, life crafting,
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.580]   is what I call the grand goal approach.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.220]   I'm going to have some grand goal that I'm all in on.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.660]   And the idea is this will kind of align
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.420]   all of the parts of my life around something, a common goal,
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.500]   and that will give me a sense of like intentionality
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.260]   in my life and direction in my life,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.460]   and it'll end up somewhere interesting.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.020]   So focusing on your work is like a classic
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.140]   grand goal strategy.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.140]   I'm going to try to just crush it at work,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.820]   and that'll just be something to orient my life around.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.100]   The problem with the grand goal strategy
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.260]   is that when you focus exclusively on one area of your life,
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.500]   you tend to either neglect or actively harm
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.820]   other areas of your life that are important
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.380]   and play a big role in your day-to-day
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.340]   subjective wellbeing.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.100]   So where you end up living,
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.980]   that your connection to other people,
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.400]   the sort of rhythm of your life,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.540]   like these other things that might be important to you
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.420]   get squashed or actively hurt
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.680]   when you focus on just one thing.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.780]   But here's the thing, the day-to-day experience,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.420]   the subjective experience of your life
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.760]   is determined by all these different parts of your life.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.380]   So if only one of them is going really well,
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.420]   these other ones are going poorly,
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.980]   overall you're not going to be as happy
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.660]   than if like more of these things were doing well.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.940]   So instead of just having one singular grand goal
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.820]   you focus on, I suggest lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.940]   which is where you work backwards
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.260]   from a broad vision of your life.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.940]   You identify the different areas of your life
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:07.900]   that might be important.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.460]   You identify what's important to you in these lives.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.900]   I call this the master narrative.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.660]   And then you begin figuring out configurations of your life
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:19.740]   that support as many of these as once, right?
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.780]   So work is a big driver of this,
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.380]   but now you're seeing work through the lens
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.160]   of not just like what you want out of your work,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.940]   but like what type of place you want to live
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.860]   and what type of rhythm between work and non-work you want
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   and what type of connection to other people you have
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   and what your typical day works out.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.560]   Work is now an engine to try to support
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.300]   as many of these things as possible,
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.980]   which is different than work being a game
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.260]   in which you're trying to get the highest score.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.620]   Now, it may turn out that the particular lifestyle
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.260]   broad vision you have is best served
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.840]   at killing it in like your work in a particular way,
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.100]   or at least for a particular amount of time,
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.180]   but you need that to be part of this broader vision.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.760]   So you got to figure out your broader master narrative here,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.980]   all parts of your life.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.020]   It's good to be visual here.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.420]   One of the things I recommend people do
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.420]   is like actually have a cultural or like concrete reference
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.940]   for each of the parts of these lives.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.500]   So you're trying to think about like,
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.020]   what's it like where I live?
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.860]   Like point to a particular like film or TV reference,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.200]   like the way it is in this show or movie, you know.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.440]   Friends, if, you know, they're kind of like in a city
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.960]   and it's kind of, but a lot of people,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.640]   the friends all live near each other
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.920]   and they kind of like hang out a lot
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.200]   and there's like an energy to it
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.320]   and like interesting stuff happening.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.360]   Or you might be like, no, no, Gilmore Girls.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.560]   I went like a small but quirky town
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.680]   and it's like tightly enmeshed, but it's kind of quiet.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.220]   And, you know, use specific references.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.400]   Like specific visual references, like each of the areas,
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.720]   and you can have a couple of notes below each,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.580]   kind of like specifying what properties
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.640]   of these images you like.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.340]   And then the whole game is trying to serve
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.220]   as many of these areas as possible.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.520]   So again, your work is the biggest tool you have
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.840]   to try to satisfy your lifestyle vision, but it's different.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.880]   There's a difference between trying to succeed
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.940]   as much as possible in work,
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.180]   do the most impressive thing possible in work
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.900]   versus using work as effectively as possible
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.620]   to get closer to this broader vision.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.440]   So now is a perfect time
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.380]   to start doing lifestyle centric planning.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.580]   This will begin introducing other parts of your life
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.500]   into your life.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.680]   By the way, many of the non-work parts
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.620]   of people think about, especially when they're young,
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.020]   end up being, connecting them to other people
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.060]   and activities, which is a good way to actually,
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.560]   you know, find someone to settle down with.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.180]   So it could work out there.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.700]   Lifestyle centric planning.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.060]   I'm really just beginning to,
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.740]   I have to start really articulating the details
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.700]   and the specificity of lifestyle centric planning
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.940]   'cause for the deep life book that I'm working on,
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.900]   I have to start getting more specific.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.780]   I'll tell you, I got about 2,500 words in that book
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.620]   and threw it out because I had a realization,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.100]   it's like, that's not the way I wanna structure these.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.200]   This is not the right structure for the chapters.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.940]   This is gonna be better.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.180]   Shoot, this is gonna be harder.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.860]   I have to kind of throw out what I did, but I did.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.380]   So it's like, I wasn't feeling my first swing at it.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.100]   - I get a lot of questions and inquiries
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.080]   about updates to the stack.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.340]   - Yeah, okay, that's interesting.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.580]   I don't use the exact stack metaphor right now in my thinking
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:29.580]   but it's definitely, I mean, I've definitely broken down
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.020]   the sort of get your act together part.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:33.860]   Like, you gotta prepare.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.480]   Get your act together before you transform your life.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.580]   Like, we often skip that part and go right to the like,
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.060]   I'm gonna move to Rotonga.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.020]   You gotta get your act together first, right?
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.540]   Then planning.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.060]   And this is where this lifestyle-centric planning
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.660]   versus the singular grand goal thinking comes up, right?
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.500]   Why lifestyle-centric planning's gonna be more effective
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.180]   than just having a singular grand goal
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.860]   and how do you actually build
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.580]   and build these master narratives, right?
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.220]   Then there's like the execution, the art.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.060]   The art of like, I wanna work backwards
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.860]   from this broad vision and figure out configurations
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.420]   of things that's going to advance
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.100]   as much of these as possible.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.020]   Like, there's an art to that and you have to get into,
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.860]   how do you research your opportunities
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.820]   and figure out what might work and be more flexible?
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.780]   And there's a whole navigating, like, how you actually,
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.700]   these plans, how you shape your plan
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.020]   to move closer to your ideal vision.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.260]   So like, that's a big part of it.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.020]   That's kind of like part three as well.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.420]   And then there's these other ideas.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.060]   I don't know where they integrate
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.460]   about looking for the remarkable opportunities.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.980]   Like, these come up typically once you're like,
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.620]   really locked into what matters to you
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.540]   and you're working very systematically towards it.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.860]   Really cool opportunities,
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.460]   that's when the cool radical stuff emerges.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.060]   So how to identify that and pursue that
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.780]   if that's what you wanna do.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.220]   Evolving these things over time.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.900]   Like, there's these other loose pieces too.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.420]   But these pieces I think are big.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.100]   The prepare, the planning, and then the actual execution
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.020]   is sort of like layer one, layer two, layer three.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.620]   But as I'm still working on it.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.140]   The big change I've been making recently
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.220]   is I decide, I'm toying with,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.580]   it's very technical, not technical before,
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.420]   but very like dense and idea-y.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.900]   And I'm thinking I actually wanna have
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.140]   some journalism in it.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:23.020]   Like, I wanna go some places, talk to some people,
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.100]   and do some things.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.100]   And have that as a spine for each of these sections.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.060]   It's harder, but I think it might
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.180]   inject some more life into it.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.180]   - Yeah.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.380]   - So I'm thinking about that.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.220]   In case people are wondering.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.380]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.980]   - Next question is from Gabriella.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.860]   Once I finish my deep work, I do other shallower work,
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.220]   like audio books, podcasts, while playing Candy Crush.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.820]   I really can't consume any of this content without it.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.460]   Is this okay?
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.700]   - Not really.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.060]   Not really, I'd be worried about that.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:01.060]   So your mind has created one of these dopamine traps
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.420]   where it wants the potential rewards
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.340]   of the Candy Crush game.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.580]   It's associated that with these other activities.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.340]   And now you get flooded with the dopamine
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.860]   when it's like you're putting on the podcast
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.740]   of I gotta get out Candy Crush and play this thing.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.380]   This is gonna hit all of these buttons for me.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.740]   I think it's a little bit dysregulated.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.420]   Like you should be able to do other things
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.780]   without having that particular
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.060]   kind of highly addictive engineered content with you.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.140]   So I kind of hear this like,
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.100]   look, I have to have a cigarette when I'm watching TV.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.540]   And it's like, you should probably not be smoking, right?
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.820]   Or like you have all these occasions
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.780]   where you have to have a drink
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.100]   because you just like, I just associate,
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.540]   I need a drink to do this, I need a drink to do that,
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.780]   I need a drink to do this.
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.700]   And I was like, eh, I think you're getting
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.420]   these like addictive loops, it's slightly dysregulated.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.940]   So I think this is a good wake up call
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.980]   to sort of do a dopamine detox here
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.460]   on this particular behavior.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.220]   Otherwise your mind stimulation requirements
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.060]   are gonna be too high.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.380]   So a couple of things here that might help
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.420]   because it's gonna be a hard habit to break.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.940]   You mentioned particularly podcasts and audio books.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.660]   So listen to those while you're doing other things,
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.100]   things that would eliminate your ability
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.260]   to also play Candy Crush.
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.540]   So like you're doing chores,
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.220]   you're mowing the yard, you're driving.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.740]   So you can start to build an association
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.940]   with these, you can build an association
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.860]   with these listening activities
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.740]   but not actually also playing the game, right?
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.700]   And it won't be too hard to do
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.780]   because you're listening to these things
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.580]   in situations where it's just impossible to play the game.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.980]   Then I would work on building up tolerance.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.940]   There's a couple of things you could do.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.340]   Build up, do reading, build up your reading tolerance.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.180]   So when you're reading,
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.500]   you have to give something your attention
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.540]   and you can't play Candy Crush at the same time.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.540]   So try to build up reading sessions.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.460]   That's gonna be good calisthenics for your brain
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.820]   and wean it off of that particular need for distraction.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.980]   I would use the phone foyer method
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.780]   when watching TV or movies.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.060]   So don't have your phone with you
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.300]   but have it plugged in in a different room.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.060]   Again, this is gonna give you practice
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.260]   avoiding that knee jerk,
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.500]   like let me pull something out
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.460]   while I'm watching this and play it.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.500]   So you're trying to break these associations
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.620]   between the passive consumption of content
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.300]   and needing to do this other thing as well.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.620]   Give this about three weeks.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.620]   So about three weeks of being uncomfortable
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.780]   and then you'll readjust
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.580]   and then you'll find like it's not a big deal
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.820]   not to have this game in your life.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.700]   But yeah, I very much worry about the games
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.620]   that are built along slot machine principles.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.540]   It screws with your stimulation requirements.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.380]   They're addictive.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.700]   It could lead to dysregulated behavior
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.620]   and that's what this feels like.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.980]   So I would wean off that.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.340]   So use the advice I have there to help do that.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.420]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   - Next question is from Nina.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.060]   I'm a homeschooling mom and I struggle to find the time
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.220]   where I have enough energy
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.180]   without getting distracted by urgent kid needs
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.620]   and household tasks to actually do my house school prep
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.780]   and planning.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.300]   What should I do?
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.340]   - So Nina, you have to give some priority
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.260]   to the energy and depth required to do the homeschool prep.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.860]   Don't give it the lowest priority.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.700]   So like what might be happening here,
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.900]   I hear this a lot with a lot of types of cognitive work
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.540]   that there's deep components
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.620]   and then lots of also shallow stuff that has to be done.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.860]   Is that the shallow stuff is often given priority
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.380]   because the deep stuff, it feels like,
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.540]   well, I'll do this when I get time.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.500]   It's not like necessary it happens right now,
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.660]   but I'll do this when I get time.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.660]   And then it gets shunted off
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.460]   to when you don't have any energy.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.940]   I would prioritize this as like
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.060]   the most important thing you do.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.540]   So probably first thing in the morning, right?
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.260]   When your energy is high,
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.300]   you can build this into your homeschooling day structure.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.060]   All right, what do we do first thing?
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.340]   We do quiet reading and then like reflection questions
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.460]   and math worksheets.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.940]   And this is the first 45 minutes of every day.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.380]   It kind of gets us in the school mindset.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.980]   And that's when me as the homeschooling teacher
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.060]   does my prep because I'm at my highest energy state there.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:04.020]   So like be willing to change how your schedule,
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.380]   to change what you're asking of other people,
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.860]   to prioritize this critical deep work task.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.300]   The other thing I would say,
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.180]   this comes from experience knowing people who homeschool.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.700]   You have to treat homeschooling from a family perspective
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.900]   as a very demanding job.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.820]   You're like a litigator.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.460]   And therefore you have to treat what happens
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.180]   after the homeschool day,
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.620]   like the way you treat it when the litigator gets back
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.300]   from like the hard day at the law firm.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.380]   A lot of what happens in these situations
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.580]   is maybe one person is doing homeschooling
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:47.620]   and their partner has like a job outside the house.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.100]   And they sort of don't treat the homeschooling
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.060]   as if it's like a super draining job.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.180]   So like you're still doing a bunch of other
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.300]   kind of related work all evening as well.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.780]   Like hardcore childcare,
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.740]   which is very similar difficulties
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.700]   to what you were doing all day during the homeschooling.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:08.460]   So it's as if the litigator comes back from the law firm
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.060]   and their partner is like,
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.740]   I have all these legal documents
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.060]   I want you to like review and file tonight, right?
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.020]   You'd be like, well, this is, I just did this all day.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:16.860]   I'm exhausted.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.620]   I don't want to sit here.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.060]   Can't you do the legal documents or file?
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.620]   That's all I've been doing all day.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.580]   But we don't think that way when the work is inside the home.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.100]   So like, well, you were home and it was autonomous
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.940]   and the, you know, it's kids said you should do the childcare
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.660]   and you're the mom and this and that.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.380]   So we underplay, this happens a lot in these partnerships
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.140]   that the homeschooling is like one of the most draining
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.100]   things you can do.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.620]   And if you have to do a bunch of like household work
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.420]   and childcare on top of it, it really can be draining.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.180]   So you have to figure this out.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.540]   Where I've seen things be successful
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.420]   is actually if someone is homeschooling,
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.180]   the other partner is going to do a disproportionate amount
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.140]   of like household work after work, right?
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.060]   Because that's very different.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.420]   If I've been at the law firm all day,
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.940]   it's not going to exhaust me to have to do chores.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.460]   It's very different than what I was doing.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.380]   It's not going to exhaust me to have to be with my kids.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.820]   It's very different than what I was doing.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.260]   But if I was homeschooling all day
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.740]   and it's right into like household chores and childcare,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.420]   there's no relief there.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.180]   It's the litigator has to come home and do contracts.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.380]   So make sure like your partner knows,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.180]   this is really, really hard what I do.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.100]   I need to like have my equivalent of the 1950s.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.940]   Where's my cocktail?
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.300]   I'm going to put my feet up.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.780]   We get confused about that sometimes.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.020]   Like the location, maybe this is better now
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.380]   that we do remote work.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.500]   People don't have these weird associations anymore
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.980]   where if like effort is in the house,
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.660]   it's somehow different than if it's at an office.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.100]   I think now maybe we've dispelled that
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.540]   because we all work at home more.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:42.020]   Anyways, that's a common thing I'm going to throw in there.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.380]   So talk to your partner about that.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.220]   All right.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:46.620]   Ooh, do we have another Slow Productivity Corner?
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.540]   - We do.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.060]   - All right.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.980]   As people know or don't know,
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.900]   we try to have one question per week
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.180]   based on ideas for my new book, "Slow Productivity."
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.140]   Check out that book if you haven't read it.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.940]   More importantly, we have cool theme music
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.180]   for the Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.320]   So let's hear that now.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.740]   (soft music)
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.020]   All right, Jesse.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.500]   I always talk smoother
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.700]   when we're doing the Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.140]   What is today's Slow Productivity question?
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.420]   - Our question is from Seth.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   I've run across a problem while trying to follow
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.880]   the three criteria of slow productivity.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.300]   I'm a project manager and all the work that I do is shallow.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.740]   I'm doing things like making sure other people are working
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.500]   or planning other people's work.
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.620]   There are very few places to apply quality or depth.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.660]   What do I do?
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.180]   How should I slowly get deeper in this shallow pond?
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.380]   - Well, that's a good question.
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.740]   I think the slow productivity principle
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:48.940]   being referred to here
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.540]   is the principle of obsessing over quality.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.300]   It's one of the big ideas in slow productivity
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.780]   is the more you care about the quality of what you do,
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.860]   the more fed up you will become with meaningless busyness
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.280]   and the better you will get at what you do,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.340]   which will give you more leverage
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.580]   to try to do less of the busyness.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.440]   So it all works like a good flywheel.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.820]   - All right, so this question comes from a product manager
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.100]   who's saying, what do I get good at?
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.060]   Everything feels shallow.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.380]   It's all like dealing with people and other things.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.380]   So I have two pieces of advice here.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.060]   One, there are good product managers
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.580]   and there's bad product managers.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.660]   There are very competitive product manager positions
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.020]   at certain firms, and then there's like less competitive,
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.080]   less impressive positions at other firms.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.060]   So there's something that differentiates
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.380]   good product managers from bad product managers
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.940]   or great product managers from okay product managers.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.740]   You have to figure that out, all right?
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.660]   Because you want to be,
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.460]   whatever the core skill is at what you do,
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.300]   you want to identify that and get better at it
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.540]   so that you get more leverage
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.340]   and you get more fed up with nonsense.
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.260]   And it might not look like a physicist
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.020]   at a chalkboard for seven hours, right?
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.060]   It might have to do with being really good
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.380]   at anticipating the needs of team members,
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.660]   being really good at reaching consensus
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.260]   on like the key decision points,
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.660]   but not allowing the conversations
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.740]   to go on too long and derail the process.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.740]   Maybe it's being very good at organizational systems
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.540]   that backstop the product being developed.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.580]   Maybe it has something to do with client relationships.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.200]   I don't know, but there is a difference
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.460]   because there's different calibers of these jobs.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.340]   I was actually just talking the other day
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.100]   at our swim club with a product manager
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.020]   and he walked me through, coincidentally,
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.380]   walked me through that whole industry,
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.060]   especially tech product managers
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.620]   and sort of like the different types of product managers
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.900]   and the elite positions.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.500]   So there is a difference between good and bad.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.400]   Figure out that difference.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.940]   You can isolate a skill to get better at.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.020]   The other thing I want to say here
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:57.140]   is be wary about the necessity of communication
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.780]   you have to do at your job,
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.780]   convincing you of the necessity
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.140]   of that communication happening
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.940]   in a very distracting, haphazard way.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.060]   All right, so what I mean by this,
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.260]   this comes up a lot when I talk to managers.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:17.140]   They will often say, look at this emails and Slack
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.980]   and online meetings that are filling my day
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.860]   and are constantly grabbing my attention,
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.900]   which we know is a cognitive disaster.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:24.740]   It makes you miserable.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.860]   You can't think straight.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.300]   We know there's research on managers
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.940]   that says the more time they spend doing this,
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:32.820]   sort of the worse they get at actual leadership activities.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.860]   We know it's bad,
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.700]   but the managers will say,
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.980]   I can point to the things that are in these emails
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.620]   and in these chat messages and they're important.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.740]   And if I didn't have these conversations,
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:42.900]   bad things would happen, right?
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.580]   It's necessary conversations.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.740]   This person needs approval to do this.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.020]   If I don't give them approval, the project is stuck.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.220]   This is necessary communication,
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.420]   but then they transfer the necessity of that communication
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.620]   to the necessity of how that communication unfolds.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.620]   I have to be distracted all day
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.740]   because the communication that's distracting me is necessary.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.940]   It's not necessarily the case.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.260]   I get into these ideas in "Slow Productivity."
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.780]   I also get into these ideas in my book
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.700]   "A World Without Email."
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.500]   There's dozens of ways to structure
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:19.380]   how this necessary information gets communicated,
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.500]   including ways that are gonna generate
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:25.220]   many fewer unscheduled messages that require responses,
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.300]   the things that create the productivity poison,
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.540]   the things required to have to constantly check in inboxes.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.860]   It's hard work, but it's exactly the hard work
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.100]   a product manager should do.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.020]   Let's figure out how we collaborate on things.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.700]   Where are we keeping track of information?
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.460]   When and how do we ask questions of each other?
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.420]   Are there office hours?
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:42.580]   Are there docket clearing meetings?
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.660]   These are both laid out in my book "Slow Productivity."
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.460]   Do we have a set process
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.620]   for how certain things we do regularly unfolds
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.380]   that doesn't require on-demand communication?
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.260]   Like I will send this to you at some point.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.420]   You have to be checking
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.140]   so that you get the file when it's ready.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:00.500]   Can we replace that with a system
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.020]   where it goes into this shared document
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.500]   by three o'clock on Tuesdays?
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.060]   There is no me checking an inbox.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.020]   I just go after three o'clock on Tuesdays
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.980]   to get the file out of that shared document.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.700]   These type of processes and structures,
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:11.780]   which you as the product manager
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.420]   can help lead the charge towards,
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.980]   doesn't change the things that get communicated,
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.620]   but changes how that communication happens.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.700]   And that can make a big difference
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.820]   and make your day feel much less fragmented
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.380]   and much less frenetic.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.860]   So don't let the necessity of communication
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.620]   trick you into the necessity of a chaotic mode
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.420]   for that communication to actually unfold.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.780]   All right, so that's my two pieces of advice
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.020]   just to summarize again.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.580]   There's good product managers, bad product managers.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.980]   Figure out the difference.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.460]   Get good at what separates the former from the latter.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.780]   Two, you have more control than you think
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.620]   to work with your team to restructure collaboration
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:51.020]   to be less arbitrary, ad hoc,
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.380]   distractive, and interruptive.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.740]   And it'll make a big difference if you do that.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.860]   You'll be a better,
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.380]   whatever you figure out's gonna be important
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.980]   to be a good product manager,
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.660]   that's gonna help you accomplish that.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.420]   All right, so all hope is not lost.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.580]   And more importantly,
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.980]   we get to hear the theme music one more time.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.560]   (gentle music)
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:21.220]   So I think that book crossed the 100,000 sales
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:25.020]   this last week, I think, or the last few days.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.220]   - Are you happy about that?
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.580]   - Yeah, to me, that's an important threshold.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.060]   It's arbitrary, but I think to me,
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.500]   it's an important threshold.
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.020]   Of my eight books now,
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:38.100]   only two have not crossed that threshold.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.700]   So I do have two books that have kind of got stuck
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.140]   in the 60,000 sales perspective.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.540]   - Which ones?
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:50.300]   - "A World Without Email," "Pandemic Release,"
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.220]   kind of slowed down and got stuck around 65,
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.220]   and "How to Be a High School Superstar."
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.860]   Those are the only ones that have not crossed 100,000.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.020]   So I don't know, it's arbitrary,
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.380]   but it's hard to sell 100,000 books.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:08.020]   So I'm always happy when that's been done.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.660]   So there we go.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.820]   We did an analysis of the publisher.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.900]   They did a chart of what's responsible for sales,
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.540]   how responsible different things were,
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.940]   like here's Amazon Marketing had a sliver here,
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.060]   and Podcast had a big sliver.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.140]   But the 80%, like the majority of the pie
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.380]   was labeled slow productivity corner theme music.
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.620]   So that's been like the primary driver.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.740]   They're like, probably like 17, 18,000 sales
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.500]   were from everything else.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.420]   All the rest is slow productivity theme music.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.300]   - That's great.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.420]   And we got it from Kieron.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:45.500]   - Kieron, shout out.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.620]   You're selling books.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:47.860]   All right, do we have a call this week?
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.700]   - We do.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.780]   - All right, let's hear this.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.900]   - Hey Cal, this is Josh.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.620]   I'm a middle school teacher and a lot of my summer
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.500]   is spent planning for the upcoming year.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.620]   But oftentimes I find myself distracted.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.260]   I end up getting in a rut where I can only put in
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.340]   maybe an hour or two each day,
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.780]   and sometimes even less than that,
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.860]   planning for the upcoming year.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:19.860]   So my question for you is how do you use extended time off
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.980]   to plan for the future while not getting stuck in a rut
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.700]   because you have so much time off?
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:27.620]   Thanks so much.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.500]   - That's a great question, Josh.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.140]   Common for a lot of open-ended pursuits
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.980]   where you have a lot of time to work on it.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.980]   The key is constraints.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.740]   Give yourself a lot of constraints,
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:41.060]   obey those constraints,
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.060]   and a lot more is gonna get done.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.300]   So like I would tell you nine to 11
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.540]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.340]   I want you at a coffee shop nine to 11
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:55.100]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.620]   all in on planning.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.500]   Like you gotta fill that time, get your energy up,
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.780]   you start the day excited.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.340]   And then you have this sort of like Thursday,
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.260]   Friday, Saturday, Sunday, this four-day weekend
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.660]   where you're kind of free from thinking about it.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.020]   You have all your afternoons too,
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.740]   so like you can go like exercise and go do other things.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.700]   But it's like those mornings, three days a week,
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:14.060]   you're all, you get all, you get in, you go all in.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.860]   You'll plan like a really good next year.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.500]   You'll probably like the basic stuff will get done
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.060]   after a few weeks and you can start doing cool stuff.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.780]   In general, I find this to be useful.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.380]   Constraints can be useful.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.620]   Regular time with high intensity
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.780]   applied over a long time period moves mountains.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.100]   Like this is how I write books.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.980]   It's two hours, one hour, three hour, no hours,
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.340]   four hours, three hours, one hour, two hours,
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.260]   100 words here, 500 words here.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:45.100]   My eyes are down on the road in front of me.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.700]   This few paragraphs is what I care about.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.860]   And you just keep doing this.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.740]   And you look up after a few months and you're like,
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.780]   oh, I have a couple of chapters here.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.100]   These are pretty good.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.260]   And you keep doing it for a while longer.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.300]   Oh, there's another chapter here.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.300]   Like that's how cool stuff gets made.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.060]   My book, "Slow Productivity" is a good quote
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.220]   in the conclusion from John McPhee about this.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.100]   And I'll paraphrase it,
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:09.020]   but basically he talks about how intense but not too long,
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.300]   just like intense writing for reasonable periods of time
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:16.180]   done day after day after day can over time generate
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.860]   a really impressive collection of work.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.660]   And he had this quote about,
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.140]   put a drop of water in a bucket every day.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.660]   You'll look up after, I forgot the time period,
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.460]   look up after a year, I think he said,
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.220]   and that bucket's gonna be pretty full.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:31.180]   So constraints are great because you get high quality work,
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.220]   but it's sustainable and stuff builds up.
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:37.300]   Just trust the power of compound productivity.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.860]   Stuff builds up.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.900]   If you keep giving it good attention
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.860]   and you do that again and again and again,
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.140]   good stuff will build up.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:47.540]   All right, we got a case study here.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.020]   That's where someone sends in their own personal account
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.540]   of working with the advice we talk about.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.940]   So we can see what this type of advice
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.220]   is like out in the wild.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:58.660]   Today's case study comes from Logan.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:03.060]   So Logan says, I've spent the last 12 years
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.780]   living with an extreme spinal condition.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.780]   Three months ago, I finally got a big promotion.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.820]   It changed nothing.
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.860]   I now had the promotion and related pay raise,
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:14.980]   but I'd lost lots of time with family and friends.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.940]   My physical health had stalled out.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:18.380]   So while on paternity leave,
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:23.380]   I took time to sit down and write out my deep life vision.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.940]   I also rated my areas by importance,
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.940]   health, relationships, enjoyment, and finally craft.
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:35.220]   I immediately saw that I had sacrificed all other areas
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.420]   for the benefit of work.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:40.420]   Coincidentally, this was also the longest I've had away
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.340]   from a desk in a decade or more,
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.660]   became undeniably clear how much damage
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.820]   simply sitting all day was doing to my physical health
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.860]   and my mental health.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.980]   During this time, I've been working with a trainer
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.220]   for my back and I began thinking
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.540]   that a career switch might be best.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.540]   I talked to the trainers and considered moving
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.580]   into that field.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.220]   I've listened to your show long enough to know
[00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.980]   not to just quit the day job
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.860]   until I have a proven path elsewhere.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.700]   I approached my manager about going part-time
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.220]   and keeping only the work where I am the expert,
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.140]   cashing in my career capital for autonomy
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.780]   and accountability.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.460]   She agreed almost immediately,
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.380]   particularly since we've discussed my health issues
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.540]   in the past.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.860]   Going part-time has been something my wife and I had
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.100]   in our long-time vision for quite a while,
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.460]   so this simply accelerated the timeline.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.140]   It works well for the family anyways,
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.340]   because my wife is eager to return to work sooner
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.100]   than we initially planned after being a stay-at-home mom
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.620]   for three years.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.940]   I'm on my second week of being part-time.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.620]   I've been fitting in way more workouts
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.460]   than I ever would have been able to in the past,
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.700]   and I'm working my way through the necessary certifications
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.380]   to be a personal trainer.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.780]   I can't speak to the financial success of this idea yet,
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.260]   but my health is better than ever,
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.980]   and I'm able to be there for my family more.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.100]   Here are some takeaways from going through this.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.500]   One, your deep work and slow productivity strategies
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.980]   are invaluable for managing a chronic illness.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:01.460]   Two, when it comes to creating a deep life vision,
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.500]   having a little bit of space to think is important,
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.460]   whether it's a few days or several long nights
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.900]   of holding a newborn.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.420]   I was unable to think in this way while working long days
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.740]   and balancing multiple commitments.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:18.140]   Three, look for opportunities that aren't where you expect.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.900]   I'd never thought of being a personal trainer,
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.420]   but at least three of the people I spoke to
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.860]   reached a conclusion before I did.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:27.340]   And four, in addition to my deep life areas,
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:30.100]   I first wrote out a quick four-sentence blurb
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.740]   about what my values and attitudes
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.180]   I wanted to live my life by.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.100]   This helped tremendously.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.900]   IEA won't be governed by fear or pain
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.460]   and I'll default to action.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.740]   It's a great case study.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.140]   There's a lot of good stuff in there,
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.100]   a lot of good ideas being put into action.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.220]   I wanna underscore the lifestyle-centric planning approach.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.380]   See, again, when you're just thinking about your job
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.020]   and maximizing whatever arbitrary scale of success
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.660]   in that job happens to exist in your industry,
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.180]   it doesn't mean your life's gonna be better.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:05.900]   So for this person, Logan, sorry, Logan,
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.580]   for Logan, by focusing just on the job,
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.060]   almost every other area of his life
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.260]   that he cared about got much worse.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.100]   Well, here's the thing,
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.740]   all those other areas affect your wellbeing every single day.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.360]   So if they're not going well,
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.580]   the fact that you have a higher title and pay raise
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.660]   is not going to, on a day-to-day basis,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.220]   balance out what you're losing
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.300]   from these other areas of your life.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.820]   Like part of the problem with the grand goal approach,
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.460]   the life design, is that you really front load
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.780]   the benefit you get from accomplishing these goals.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.800]   Logan probably felt awesome for a day
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.780]   about I won this promotion and it was competitive
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.820]   and I make more money and I kind of wish I had a way
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.060]   of kind of telling people that I made more money.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.860]   And then you've got that reward.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.900]   You don't get that reward again,
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.140]   but every day you're missing all the stuff,
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.540]   the other things you care about that are being diminished.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.140]   You're paying that price every day,
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.420]   but the reward for accomplishing the goal
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.100]   is already dissipated.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.060]   So actually having these other areas of your life,
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.620]   like it's more time with his family,
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.320]   his health feeling better,
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.780]   allowing his wife to go back and do these other ideas,
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.280]   go back to work and being like,
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.780]   I'm able to make that happen.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.980]   Like these other things that are important,
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.300]   you're getting benefits from those every day.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.340]   Net, net, that's going to balance out better.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.660]   So lifestyle centric planning is really important.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:30.020]   And again, it's not about saying your job
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.420]   is not important or is important.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.100]   It's just knowing what you're using this as an engine for.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.060]   So he was so good at his job that him going down part time
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.580]   was still financially viable.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.420]   Hey, and by the way, it made his job much better
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.420]   because he's only doing the work that he's an expert on
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.740]   and then B or C it opened up all these other things.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:49.480]   So a classic lifestyle centric planning case study.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.140]   So Logan, I appreciate that.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.500]   And the personal trader stuff could be,
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.460]   hey, I see this a lot.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.960]   People who have a chronic health issue
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.100]   really care a lot about physical health.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.780]   And so a job like being a trainer,
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.340]   like as a part-time job is really meaningful to them.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.820]   It's not arbitrary to be really meaningful.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.260]   So I could imagine a world in which you're doing
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.540]   this part-time job, high salary work,
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.860]   and then you're doing some of this training work
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.460]   and it helps keep you really healthy.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.420]   And it's really interesting
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.120]   and it balances out that other job.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.620]   And you have more time with your family
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.840]   and this flexibility.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.540]   All of this seems like a great lifestyle centric
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.840]   planning scenario.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.300]   So Logan, thanks for sending that in.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.260]   All right, so we've got a final segment coming up
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.260]   where I'll talk about Jon Haidt,
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.840]   but first hear from another sponsor.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.920]   So I wanna talk about our friends at Element LMNT.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.180]   You've heard me talk about their drink mix before,
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.800]   a mix that gives you those electrolytes you need
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.380]   to replace the salts you lose when you exercise
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.560]   or like this last weekend in DC in which,
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.060]   I don't know if you got the temperature reading, Jesse,
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.720]   but I think it was roughly 118 degrees.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.940]   I'm not sure if that's accurate.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.540]   So just walking outside last weekend,
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.900]   you're gonna lose a lot of these salts.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.380]   So I love the LMNT drink mix
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:05.180]   because it's no sugar, no junk, high quality,
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.020]   add it to water.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.580]   It's what I drink after every workout.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.600]   It's what I drink after long days of podcasting.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.940]   It's what I drink by just looking outside
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.060]   during last weekend's heat wave.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.420]   So I'm a big fan of LMNT.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.540]   I'm also excited they have this new product coming
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.080]   called Element Sparkling.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.660]   So it delivers that same zero sugar electrolyte formulation
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:25.580]   you already know and trust,
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:30.500]   but now in a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling water,
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.740]   no sugar, no caffeine,
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.620]   but all those electrolytes you need.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.860]   Just grab it out of the fridge, it's already cold.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:39.100]   Some great flavors, citrus salt, watermelon salt,
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.060]   and grapefruit salt,
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.140]   which you also know from the drink mixes,
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.220]   but they have a new flavor called Black Cherry Lime,
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.980]   which you can only get in the sparkling.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.380]   So I love the LMNT drink mixes
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.300]   and I'm excited about LMNT Sparkling.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:56.300]   Right now, LMNT Sparkling is available to LMNT Insider.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.220]   So if you're an LMNT Insider,
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.580]   you have access to LMNT Sparkling right now.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:05.100]   Well, you'll find out more at drinkelement.com,
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.340]   but it'll go wider soon.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.500]   So I just wanted to plant the seed.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.160]   This cool product is out there.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.900]   Try it if you're an insider
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.660]   and be eager for it if you're not.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.660]   So you can get a free sample pack

[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.900]   And again, if you're an LMNT Insider,
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.140]   you'll also have first access to LMNT Sparkling,
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.700]   a bold 69 cans of sparkling electrolyte water.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.180]   So head over to drinkelementlmnt.com/deep
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:36.000]   to get your free sample pack with any drink mix purchase.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.100]   I also wanna talk about our friends at Ladder.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.320]   I don't typically procrastinate on things.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.940]   In fact, this interview I did today with a reporter,
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.820]   he asked point blank, "Do you ever procrastinate?"
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.120]   There are some things, however, that I do procrastinate on,
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.340]   and they typically are things
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:58.180]   where I don't really know how to take action.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.540]   I don't really know what to do.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.540]   I'm just gonna put that aside.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.380]   Well, for a lot of people,
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.700]   something that satisfies that condition
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.100]   is gonna be life insurance.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.160]   You know you need more.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.440]   You know you wanna protect those who depend and care on you,
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.320]   but because you don't know how to actually make progress
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.460]   on how do I get life insurance, you procrastinate on it.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.380]   This is where Ladder enters the scene.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.420]   It solves that problem.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.500]   It makes it easy.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.640]   Ladder is 100% digital.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.220]   There's no doctors, no needles, and no paperwork.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.960]   When you apply for $3 million in coverage or less,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.340]   you just answer a few questions
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.140]   about your health in an application.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:41.140]   You just need a few minutes and a phone or laptop to apply.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.800]   Their smart algorithms will work in real time,
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.900]   so you'll find out instantly if you're approved.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.260]   We're talking no hidden fees, cancel anytime,
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.220]   full refund if you change your mind in the first 30 days.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.380]   These are policies issued by insurers
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:56.780]   with long proven histories of paying claims.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.900]   They are rated A and A+ by A and Best.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.040]   And because life insurance is only gonna cost more
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.900]   as you age, now is the time to cross that off your list.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:11.580]   Sorry, I dropped my page here for a second.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.820]   So go to Ladder.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.580]   Ladder is gonna stop your procrastination on life insurance.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:16.660]   So how do we do this?
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.840]   Well, you go to the website, ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.440]   Go there today, and you can see if you're instantly approved.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep,
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.900]   ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.100]   All right, Jesse, let's do our final segment.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.360]   All right, so a lot of people,
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.640]   I guess, right, Jesse, have been writing in.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.480]   - Yeah. - You get most
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.800]   of these messages.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.900]   They've been writing in and asking for my thoughts
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:49.140]   on John Haidt's most recent book,
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.560]   which I've loaded up here on the screen
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.080]   for people who are listening.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.480]   The book is called "The Anxious Generation,
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.080]   "How the Great Rewiring of Childhood
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.760]   "is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness."
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.640]   Let me just point out, by the way,
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.840]   this book is just killing it.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.880]   Number three on Amazon charts.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.800]   I just checked, number seven on the Amazon rankings
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.840]   at the moment.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.960]   This book came out in March, right?
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.960]   It's killing it because John was the leading thinker
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:22.240]   and proponent for the research about kids and phones,
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.560]   and people really started caring about this,
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.600]   and he had the book on it.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.680]   Like, if you have kids and you worry about,
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.500]   "What should I do with them and phones?"
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.760]   This is the book you read.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.140]   Everyone at our school is talking about it.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.840]   Just perfect timing, perfect topic.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.680]   It's a writer's dream.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.520]   So, John, like, congratulations to you.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.960]   All right, what do I feel about this?
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.800]   I agree with basically everything John says.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.940]   Why?
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.760]   Well, I've known John for a while.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.160]   I've known his research for a while.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.980]   You know, I interviewed him for a "New Yorker" piece
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.400]   back in 2021, and he gave me access
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.640]   to this sprawling annotated bibliography
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.760]   of all of the research on kids and phones,
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.800]   and they would grow it.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.320]   He worked on this with Gene Twenge,
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.120]   or Gene Twenge, sorry, Gene,
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.640]   and they would add and add to this,
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.400]   and they had conversations in this.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.320]   Like, someone would publish a critical,
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.000]   a critique of another article,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.520]   and then the authors of the original article would respond,
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.160]   and the critique authors would respond to that.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.260]   I mean, it was a living, breathing document
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.320]   of everything that was being published,
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.560]   and it became clear to me following this research,
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.920]   talking to John about it, but following this research,
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.240]   that a clear signal was emerging.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.240]   Smartphones are harmful for teenagers on average, right?
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.960]   There was harm here.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.320]   Like, all of these research fields,
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.160]   at first, it's, you know, I don't know.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.360]   Like, we have this, but other people are saying this,
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.540]   but what happened is we got more and more clarity.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.760]   As you got different instruments of measurement,
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.460]   as you got more refined data, more refined studies,
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.840]   more different ways of looking at this question,
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.120]   all of the arrows started pointing in the same direction.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.360]   That's how you know a real signal
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.520]   is emerging in the literature.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.960]   Those who are still out there saying
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.360]   we're not quite sure yet,
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.000]   there was, for example,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.820]   I think a intellectually vacuous
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.900]   and somewhat mean-spirited review of the book,
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.080]   I think it was in Nature,
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.740]   that was still trotting out this circa 2019 argument
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.880]   about like, we don't even, we don't know for,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.320]   you know, it's correlation,
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.940]   and we're not even sure if they cause problems.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.080]   The literature is way past that.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.520]   I know that by reading these research bibliographies.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.440]   So, I think John's summary of this is good.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.240]   I think his conclusions are also good.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.720]   You wanna wait until a kid is probably post-puberty
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.640]   before they get unrestricted access to the internet
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.760]   through a smartphone.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.920]   It's gonna be somewhere around 15 to 16.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.120]   At the very least, you'd wanna wait till high school,
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.080]   but probably even 15 or 16
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.560]   is like what is going to be most recommended.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.240]   I've been saying that for multiple years now
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.120]   because of John's work.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.600]   It still is right.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.180]   I still think that's the right answer.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.180]   I still think that's right.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.440]   I think this book is killing it now
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.240]   because everyone else is catching up to where he was.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.120]   If you want a shareable summary of these conclusions
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.440]   in this research to show like parents at your schools
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.400]   or like parents of friends or what have you,
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.360]   I did a podcast episode last May of 2023.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.160]   This was episode 246 called "Kids and Phones."
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.300]   And in that episode, I basically gave the talk
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.080]   I had prepared for my kids' school
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.860]   where I went through all of the research
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.500]   and conclusions about kids and phones,
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.520]   drawing heavily from John Haidt's work.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.400]   So, if you want a video or an audio episode
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.560]   that's shareable, that gets to the core argument
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.240]   about what do we know about this?
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.920]   How has our understanding of phones changed?
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.560]   What's the best recommendation?
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.080]   Check out episode 246, "Kids and Phones."
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.000]   And again, that's from May of 2023.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.080]   But yes, John is the real deal.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.600]   He's been on this.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.420]   His meta-analysis here I think is right.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.240]   I've been saying this for a while now on the show, Jesse,
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.600]   that five or six years from now,
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.540]   we're gonna look back at giving phones to kids
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.320]   under 15 or 16 as crazy.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.280]   And I think now we're finally seeing,
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.760]   people are catching up with this literature.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   We're beginning to see those shifts.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.240]   And I think it's a good thing.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.940]   Doesn't make me popular at my kids' school,
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.780]   but I think it's a good thing.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.320]   We can't keep saying, "Kids these days,
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.200]   "they gotta have the phone.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.960]   "They're 12 now and they're friends of,"
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.200]   and trust me, the research is not pretty.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.240]   - Did you ever listen to the Tyler Cohn/Haidt interview?
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.080]   - Some of it.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   Yeah, that was pretty aggressive.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.880]   - Yeah, it seemed to be.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.160]   But then I think Tyler was asking him,
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.940]   "What's your concrete advice?"
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.200]   Like, "Do you want government intervention,"
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.040]   stuff like that.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.640]   - I honestly think, I think John was very,
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.480]   here's my, I don't know, I haven't talked about this.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.400]   It read to me like an early cycle interview
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.080]   where John hadn't finished his media prep yet.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.040]   Like, so people don't know the process
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.840]   of doing these media tours like I just did
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.800]   for slow productivity, but you get your ducks in a row.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.720]   Like, you know what, you know your ideas,
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.760]   you know your advice, you know the scenarios,
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.820]   you just have this down, right?
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.120]   Like, you know how to navigate
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.280]   and then you're ready to go out there
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.440]   and do a bunch of interviews.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.600]   Early cycle, you're still trying
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.680]   to get these things together.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.080]   So I'll often, for example,
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.400]   I'll record my first interviews pretty early.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.400]   I recorded my first interviews
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.760]   about two months before the book came out.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.480]   And I did 'em typically with like mid-tier podcasts
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.840]   with smaller audiences just to sort of get my legs
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.520]   under myself, okay, to be released later.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.460]   But just to like get my ducks in a row.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.400]   And then by the time I'm on Huberman
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.400]   or like I'm going back and forth with Sam Harris,
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.480]   I've really got all my things down
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.920]   and I know how I feel about things
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.680]   and I have really tight responses to things.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.440]   The Tyler Cowen just felt like,
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.760]   I mean, it was early cycle for John
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   and he was doing a big show.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.840]   And so Tyler's like, what about this, what about this?
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.020]   And John was like, hold on,
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.160]   I haven't like fully worked through these answers
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.720]   and I wasn't expecting to be like asked about my politics.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.800]   But then he just sharpened up
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.280]   and I think he's like a phantom.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.800]   If you listen to like Hype Now, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.520]   Like he's fully, 'cause he got a,
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.880]   there's a lot of attacks that came.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.220]   He got some attacks, not as much as I feared.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:12.000]   He got some attacks because his past book,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.480]   "The Coddling of the American Mind"
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.640]   was in a very, I think, very like fair
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.600]   and centrist and low-key way
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.880]   was still like pushing back against
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.720]   what it sounds like progressive cancel culture
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.560]   and some of the excesses of wokeness.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560]   So that put him on the hit list a little bit
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.920]   of especially, the memo wasn't really going around.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.600]   So do we not like this guy or not?
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600]   And so he kind of got a variety.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.960]   There were some sort of scurrilous attacks.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.640]   By scurrilous, I mean, I just got the memo,
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.080]   we're supposed to take this person down.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.920]   I'll sort of figure out how to do it on the fly.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.040]   And you could sort of tell that.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.700]   But he didn't get as much as that as you would have expected.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.560]   Like the New York Times book review was very positive
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.760]   that look, erudite, engaging, combative, crusading.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.680]   So I think he didn't get as much of that.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.080]   I do think one of my New Yorker colleagues
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.980]   sort of casually was like, well, you know, he's racist,
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.320]   but there's some things in this book that are good.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.920]   So there's like some of that going on.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.200]   But he, you know, so he's,
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.920]   I'll try to say he's had to toughen up.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.320]   And then I think now he's like (imitates punching)
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.160]   He knows what he's doing.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.200]   - It's not a lot of books.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.040]   - My God.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.080]   I think this book is gonna do--
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.760]   - Atomic Habits?
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.440]   - It's not gonna Atomic Habits.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.760]   But he is gonna do,
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.360]   man, let me try to predict this.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.640]   'Cause I've already done 100,000 copies.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.680]   So he's probably,
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.880]   I think he's gonna pass a million copies in his first year.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.360]   And then I don't know what the,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.200]   I think a book like this has a long half-life
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.160]   because it's like the reference.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.080]   Like this is the book you buy
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.160]   when you have a question on the phone.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.600]   So I think this is gonna be a like
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.640]   three to five million copy seller.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.480]   - Really?
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.300]   - Yeah.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.360]   Maybe more, probably not.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.640]   I don't know.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.880]   Could be.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.720]   Good for John.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.700]   All right, well, anyways, that's all the time we have.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:16:59.800]   We weren't sure if I was even gonna be able
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.160]   to do this episode in studio
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.300]   because I'm leaving imminently for undisclosed locations
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.760]   for the month of July.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.420]   But we got this one in under the wire.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.880]   So there'll be a couple episodes coming up
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.400]   that Jess and I will record remotely,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.340]   but the show will go on more or less as it always has,
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.560]   just from a different location.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.520]   I'll see this time, Jesse,
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.520]   if I can get a scenic locale for my filming.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.120]   We kind of failed at that at Dartmouth
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.880]   'cause the thing would overheat
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.480]   and we had all these problems,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.620]   but I have a new beefy laptop,
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.600]   like a brand new MacBook Pro.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.160]   And it's got a good camera
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.760]   and it can handle higher quality streaming.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.000]   I got a good light for it.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.840]   I got my mic.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.680]   I'm gonna try again
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.320]   to see if we can have like a scenic location.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.280]   It probably won't be, but you know,
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.120]   we'll mess around with it.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.280]   So anyways, next time you hear me,
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.800]   I'll be in my undisclosed location,
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.920]   but the show will go on and I'm looking forward to it.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.520]   So we'll be back.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.020]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.240]   Hey, so if you liked today's discussion
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.000]   of ultra process content,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.560]   and you wanna find out more about what about kids
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.040]   and this type of content, especially kids using phones,
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.180]   check out episode 246,
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:14.280]   where I get into the research on kids and phones.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.160]   Check it out.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.760]   So that's the deep dive we wanna do today.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.040]   Today's deep question is,
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.340]   are smartphones bad for kids?
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.100]   And if so, how do we know that?
