[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   - There's tons of research that asks people
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.140]   to predict what deep conversations will be like
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.400]   and ask them how much would you want
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.120]   to have a conversation like that?
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.080]   And then forces a separate group of people
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   to have those conversations
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.940]   and asks them what was that like?
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.280]   And it turns out that we vastly
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.560]   and systematically underestimate the value
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.960]   of all sorts of deep conversations.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.420]   Again, confiding, opening up, sharing information.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260]   People imagine that those conversations will be cringe
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.960]   and awkward and unproductive, maybe even damaging.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.920]   I happen to be a runner
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   and I often do not want to go on a run.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.880]   I just don't want to do it.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.080]   But then afterwards I'm glowing.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.820]   I'm so glad that I did it.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.120]   And what I try to do is with my pre-run inertia
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.220]   to remind myself of what my future self will think.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.720]   I think we should do that much more
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.300]   with our connections and conversations
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.140]   with each other as well
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.140]   because we are systematically underestimating their value.
