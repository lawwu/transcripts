[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:17.120]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the sixth chapter and reading verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.560]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.520]   Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.520]   devil.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.680]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.400]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   places.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.720]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.560]   evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.880]   Those who meet here regularly will realize that we are still considering this great and
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.560]   important statement of the apostle, and that in particular we are looking at this word
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.120]   about the wiles of the devil.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.240]   The apostle gives a very solemn warning to these Ephesians and through them to all other
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.760]   Christians to bear in mind always that they are confronted by the wiles of the devil.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.440]   The story of the Christian is not just that he believes and is converted and saved and
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.000]   never has another problem.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.640]   Alas, that isn't true.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.080]   He wages a fight, he wrestles, and he wrestles not against flesh and blood, but he is confronted
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.320]   by all the malignity and all the wiliness and the subtlety of the devil and all the
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   forces that he commands.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.240]   And therefore the apostle warns them to be prepared for this, in order that they may
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   be enabled to stand.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.320]   Now we are considering these wiles of the devil, and we have seen that they are almost
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.360]   endless in their variety.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.480]   We are interested in the moment in the wiles of the devil as they are turned upon us in
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.440]   the realm of our experience.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.320]   We consider them as they attack the mind, we shall look at them as they attack us in
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.880]   the realm of practice.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.560]   But now we are looking at it from the experimental standpoint, and in particular we have arrived
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.880]   at the point where we are considering how the devil tries to produce in us a general
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.160]   spirit of discouragement.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.600]   We began with that theme last Sunday morning.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.980]   We indicated the temperament, of course, and obviously comes into this and plays a very
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.280]   great part in it.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.080]   But in addition there is this tendency to introspection and to morbidity, which can
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.520]   be very paralyzing.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.160]   We saw how we are sometimes made to worry about our lack of progress and development,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   and finally we looked at that phrase, "Be not weary in well-doing."
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.600]   But still we haven't finished with this matter of general discouragement.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.520]   Another way in which the devil produces that general discouragement very frequently is,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.840]   through worry and anxiety.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.680]   Now, here again, of course, is a very great subject.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.520]   Temperament comes in once more.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.560]   We've seen that the devil is an expert on our temperaments.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   He knows us, knows us much better than we know ourselves.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.720]   And he trims his particular temptation, his particular approach, along the line of our
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.880]   temperament.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.520]   And there are some who are naturally given to worry and to anxiety.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.760]   They're that type of person.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.480]   And the devil, knowing this, presses them along that very point.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.640]   What he does, of course, he doesn't do it openly, but what he does is this.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.880]   He knows that they're conscientious.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.240]   He knows that they're sensitive people, highly strung people.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.280]   People who are never content to do a thing anyhow somehow.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.880]   They're perfectionists.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.360]   They're never content with anything less than a kind of absolute perfection, which
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.760]   is a very good thing.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.880]   But the devil comes and he presses that, so that it becomes a very grievous thing.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.920]   And they end in this state and condition in which everything practically is a problem,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.000]   and everything becomes a burden.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.800]   Now, the Bible's got a great deal to say about this.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.280]   There is a great deal of warning in the Bible against what it calls "the cares of this
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   world."
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.160]   Clearly, it's something that has always afflicted God's people, this type in particular,
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.200]   the cares of this world.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:17.920]   Or, if you like, you've got a classic example of this in the case of Martha.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.720]   She is the great type and example of this tendency to worry and to anxiety.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.400]   Our Lord turned to her and said, "Martha, thou art troubled about many things."
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.240]   And it means distracted, torn hither and thither, so that she scarcely knew what she was doing.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.620]   Now, that's the type of thing that we are looking at at the moment.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.840]   It means that the mind is filled and preoccupied with things pertaining to life.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.220]   Now, they're perfectly legitimate things.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.960]   It's very important we should remember that.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.280]   We've already considered evil thoughts and imaginations and distractions along that line.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.840]   We're not considering that now.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.280]   We're considering people who have got a concern about things that are not only legitimate,
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.160]   but things which, generally speaking, are essential to life.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.280]   This may be, well, the particular problem of the housewife, the mother in the home,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.560]   who's got a husband and children to look after and to care for.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.520]   These things are right and legitimate.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.880]   But what the devil does is so to fill the mind and the consciousness with these cares,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:41.600]   these legitimate matters, that they not only become a burden, but they crowd out spiritual
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.240]   thoughts, they crowd out spiritual realities.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.520]   And though we are dealing with a Christian person, the main outlook in life and the main
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.280]   tenor of the life almost ceases to be a spiritual one at all.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.440]   And the time is given exclusively to these problems and affairs.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:10.040]   Well, it's obvious how the devil would clearly make great use of this particular tendency
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.000]   in certain persons.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.780]   If he can keep our minds from God and from the Lord Jesus Christ, if he can keep us from
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.560]   thinking about the soul and about our growth and development, obviously he is more than
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   satisfied.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.360]   And that is what he does with this type of person.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   And that is why, you see, our Lord himself more than once paid great attention to this
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.620]   particular matter.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.000]   You remember how in the parable of the sower he does that.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.960]   The danger is not merely that the devil comes and takes the word immediately.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.960]   No, no.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   He says there's another type of person.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.400]   And the whole trouble with this kind of person is that the devil just brings in the cares
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.640]   and the affairs of this world and the world is choked.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.560]   That's the sort of thing that we have in mind.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.520]   But there's a still more solemn warning.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:13.440]   Here is our Lord giving his prophecy of the course of history and the end of the world.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.920]   You'll find it in the twenty-first chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.040]   But this is how he finishes.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   Verse thirty-four.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.440]   "Take heed to yourselves."
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   Take heed to yourselves.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.560]   You've got to be careful.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.920]   Same thing, you've got to watch the wiles of the devil.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   "Lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness."
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   Well, you see, that's all right.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.940]   We are Christian people.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.520]   We needn't worry about being overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.600]   But wait a minute.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:54.080]   Not only with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.720]   "And so that day come upon you unawares.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.600]   For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.080]   Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.800]   things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of Man."
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.120]   In other words, the Apostle Paul here in the section that we are looking at is just repeating
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.800]   and putting in his own way what our Lord and Savior himself at the very end of his life
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:34.080]   under the shadow of the cross was so careful to teach to his followers.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.920]   We've got to take care, we've got to pay great heed.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   Lest the cares of this life render us unprepared for this momentous event which is coming.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.520]   Well now then, there is the kind of thing that we are dealing with.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.360]   You're familiar with it.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.800]   Worry and anxiety, trouble and burdens.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.160]   Everything becomes a burden so that in the end the poor person becomes utterly distracted
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.200]   and scarcely able to control himself or herself.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.220]   How do we meet this?
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.360]   This particular manifestation of the wilds of the devil?
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.320]   Well the first thing of course still is to recognize the hand of the devil.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.280]   That's all important.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.720]   The trouble is, you see, that we tend to look at the problems, the circumstances and the
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   conditions and we fail to see the hand behind them.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.760]   Now the whole secret of victory is to realize that it is the devil and not the circumstances.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.720]   We must realize that it is he who is trying to get us into this paralyzed spiritual condition.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.360]   We start with that realization.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.840]   And then the next step is of course to reprimand ourselves.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.200]   We must reprimand ourselves for many reasons.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.760]   Here's one, and it's a sufficient one.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.600]   A Christian person has never a right to be agitated.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.040]   The Christian has no business to be in what we call a dither.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.320]   That is just utterly wrong in a Christian on general principles.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   A Christian should never be out of control.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.240]   That's one of the great differences between the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.800]   There's an element of discipline always in the life of the Christian.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.120]   Show me a man who's always losing his self-control.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.040]   Well then I say if he is a Christian at all he's a very poor one.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.600]   He has no right to be like that.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.480]   So we must reprimand ourselves.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.120]   We say what am I agitated like this?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.360]   Why am I agitated like this?
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.720]   Doesn't my Christianity make any difference to me at all?
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.880]   You pull yourself up.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.000]   You condemn yourself.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   You reprimand yourself.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.520]   You say I have no right to be like this.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.400]   In other words, as I'm never tired of pointing out, we have to preach to ourselves and we
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.320]   have to say you've allowed the devil once more to trip you.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.640]   You've been looking at the circumstances.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.400]   You can't see that it's the devil who's crowding them in upon your mind in order to get you
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.680]   into this dither and into this paralytic condition.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.360]   So you reprimand yourself for your failure, for your folly.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.960]   And then the next step is the realization of the need of self-discipline.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:30.760]   Now I can only touch upon this great matter this morning, but here is the essence of self-discipline.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.880]   The Christian of all people should always have a sense of proportion, but it doesn't
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.680]   come to us automatically.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.240]   We have to do it quite deliberately.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.680]   Now it's because we fail to do that the devil gets his opportunity.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:55.040]   But the Christian is one who should always be reconsidering his or her whole position
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:03.960]   in life and in this world, and having done so, should always get certain priorities and
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.680]   always have a sense of proportion.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.960]   I'm not sure that this isn't one of the best definitions of the Christian life.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.680]   The difference between the non-Christian and the Christian is this, that the life of the
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:21.640]   non-Christian is being determined and manipulated by the world, whereas the Christian is a man
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.200]   who's in charge, he's in control.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.080]   Now there it was in that word we read just now, 2 Timothy 1, 12.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.640]   Here's the apostle, you see, in prison, and everything, as it were, going against him.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.360]   Gets his messages, discouraging messages from Timothy.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   If ever a man had a right to be overwhelmed and to lose his balance and his self-control,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.080]   it was the apostle Paul.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   But he says, "Nevertheless I am not ashamed."
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   What he means is, "I'm not put out.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.800]   I'm not in a dither.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.080]   I'm not making haste.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   I'm not upside down.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.040]   Nevertheless I am not ashamed.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.240]   I don't lose my balance.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.640]   committed unto him against that day."
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640]   That's it.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.400]   Now that's, I say, a man who's in charge of life.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   He is disciplined.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   He's got self-discipline.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.880]   He talks to himself.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.760]   He keeps everything in proportion.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.840]   Let me go back to the classic example of Martha.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.440]   You see, our Lord puts it in that well-known phrase.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.960]   "Martha," he says, "you are busy, troubled, distracted about many things.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.680]   You're running back and forth from the kitchen to this room, and you're listening and going
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.160]   away, and you're back and forth, and you don't know where you are.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   You're in a flurry.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   You're excited.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.160]   You've lost control of yourself."
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:49.960]   "Mary," he says, "has chosen that good part."
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.800]   It's a question of choice, Martha says our Lord.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.080]   It isn't that it's illegitimate to prepare a meal such as Martha was doing.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.940]   She was concerned to entertain our Lord, and she feels it must be done.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.920]   Everything of the best must be brought forward, and she needs the help of her sister.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.720]   But here's her sister Mary sitting there and listening to the Lord.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.180]   Why doesn't she help?
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.840]   So Martha was excited and troubled.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:16.400]   "Now," said our Lord to Martha very gently, "it's a question of priorities, Martha.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.240]   It's a question of choice.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.600]   Mary has chosen that good part.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.680]   One thing is needful.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.800]   Put that at the beginning.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.440]   Put that in the center.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.800]   Make certain that that always has your priority.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.200]   Then, if you've got that in the right place, let everything else fall into its right respective
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   position.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   That's a sense of proportion."
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.920]   And, my dear friends, that's the whole secret at this point.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.900]   But you've got to do this deliberately.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.900]   It means discipline.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.900]   Mary had got it.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.900]   Martha hadn't got it.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.200]   Our Lord is telling Martha to discipline herself.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.400]   And that's how she's got to do it.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   The good part.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   Keep the right things first.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   Keep them at the center.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.400]   Ah, the family, the house, the home, the children, the husband, the work, the business, the profession,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   all these things are all right.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.780]   They're very important.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.640]   But they were never meant to be at the center of life.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.780]   It's God.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.600]   It's the Christ who's in the center.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.440]   The soul.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.420]   We are not primarily fathers or mothers or anything else.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.400]   We are souls in the sight of God.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:30.800]   Shall we put this perhaps in the form of that story about that tombstone?
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.080]   In a certain churchyard, I believe, there is a tombstone which is still to be seen.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.000]   And there lies so-and-so.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Born a man, died a grocer.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   You see how important these things are.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.680]   He's never meant to die as a grocer.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.840]   He's meant to be a man.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.120]   And we're all souls.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.640]   And we are God's people.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   Priorities.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.760]   Keep these things first.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   Then the devil will not have this opportunity.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.160]   Well, let's put it in the words of the Apostle Paul.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.040]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.280]   That's Philippians 4, 6 and 7.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.360]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   You mustn't be worried about anything.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.080]   You mustn't get into a dither about anything.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.480]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.120]   That word "nothing" is as all-inclusive as a word can be.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.600]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   Nothing at all.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.040]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.160]   So it doesn't matter what your problem is this morning, however desperate.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   It doesn't matter.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.760]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.360]   Don't have anxious care.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.240]   Don't get alarmed and excited.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.520]   Don't get into a dither, whatever it may be.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.520]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:53.560]   But in all things, with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.640]   known unto the Lord.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.760]   And the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.760]   of Christ Jesus.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.040]   Well, there it is.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.200]   I wish we could stay with it.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.520]   We must hurry on.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.960]   The devil tries to get us into that state of worry and hyper-anxiety.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.400]   And the answer is along the lines I've been trying to indicate.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   Now there's something closely related to this, and that is fear of the future.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.400]   It's a subdivision, if you like, of the previous one.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   And yet it does deserve a classification on its own.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.280]   Because here, in addition to this natural tendency to anxiety and worry, imagination
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   comes in.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.960]   It's a great thing to have an imagination, but it can be a burden and a problem.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.080]   The people who lack imagination are fortunate in some respects, though they lose so much
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.840]   in other respects.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.360]   But a lively imagination will be used by the devil and will go on into the future, the
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:01.160]   future which is quite unknown, and he'll conjure up possibilities.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.840]   What's going to happen?
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.280]   What's going to take place?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.400]   What suffering are we going to endure?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.240]   And then the question, shall we be able to stand it?
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.040]   Will our faith hold?
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   Will we be strong enough and so on?
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:22.120]   Well, now, here again we've got the perfect example, and it is of course Timothy, Paul's
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.280]   disciple Timothy.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:33.600]   He is the biblical example of this whole mentality which is naturally one given to fear and anxiety,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.960]   but especially fear of the future.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.400]   And of course Timothy had many good reasons for being afraid of the future.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.880]   The great apostle is in prison.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.640]   Rumors are circulating that he's about to be put to death.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.760]   There are troubles in the churches.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.680]   He, Timothy, is but a young man.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.200]   What's going to happen?
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.760]   What future can there possibly be in such circumstances?
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.080]   Everything seems to be going, and here he is, fearful and filled with alarm as he looks
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.480]   at the future, losing his self-control, sending his frantic messages to the great apostle,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.000]   wondering why God hasn't set the apostle free, why is God allowing this and so on.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.400]   All these things come in because he is looking to the future and he is afraid of the future.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.360]   Now then, what do we say about this?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.680]   How do we meet the wiles of the devil at this particular point?
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:41.640]   Well, the means and the method is very much the same, except that I start with this very
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:51.840]   practical one, that apart from any other reason, this is an utter and a complete waste of time.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.120]   To spend your time worrying about the future on grounds which are not Christian at all
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:04.200]   is a sheer and an utter waste of time.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.920]   Because the thing you are thinking about may never happen, you don't know.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.760]   Don't cross your bridges until you arrive at them.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.840]   That's common sense, that's the world, isn't it?
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.320]   But how often do we as Christians forget to apply that?
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:24.240]   It's a useless thing, it's a waste of energy, it's a sheer waste of time.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.800]   And while you are worrying about the unknown future and the possibilities, you are failing
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.320]   to live and to function as you ought in the presence.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.960]   It's a form of madness.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.880]   Very well, recognize it, condemn yourself for it once more.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.160]   See that it's the hand of the devil.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.240]   Do this same thing every time.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.160]   Pull yourself up, address yourself, shake yourself, reprimand yourself.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.360]   See what a fool you are to allow the devil to turn your mind and to work it up into a
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.880]   frenzy over mere possibilities and how you are paralyzed in the present.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.040]   Very well, that's the first thing.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.920]   But in addition to that, you can tell yourself that you are actually breaking a specific
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.600]   command of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   Take no thought for the moral.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.880]   Now by that he means don't take anxious thought.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.560]   It doesn't mean that you don't make provision and do what is necessary in life.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.280]   He's talking about this worry and anxiety, what are we going to wear tomorrow, what are
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.200]   we going to eat, what's going to happen, and this and that.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   Don't do that, he says.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.520]   You must never have anxious care about the moral.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.800]   Indeed, he says, take no thought for the moral in that way.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:43.120]   So that we see at once that we are breaking a very specific command and injunction of
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.240]   our blessed Lord himself.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.680]   He says you are behaving like the Gentiles.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   You see the contrast?
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.760]   What's the difference between a non-Christian and a Christian?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.560]   Oh, it's this.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.920]   The nations of the world, the Gentiles, the unbelievers, they spend all their time in
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.720]   thinking about the moral.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.440]   They're living only for this world, and that's their life, what you wear, what you eat, what
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.840]   you're going to do tomorrow, what's going to happen to you.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.440]   The nations of the world, the Gentiles do that.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.000]   He says you are not like that, you mustn't be like that.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.840]   You are children of your heavenly Father, and therefore you behave in an utterly different
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   manner.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.960]   So you take no thought for the moral.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.840]   Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:35.540]   But on top of that, let's remind ourselves that as Christians we have received the Holy
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.540]   Spirit.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.960]   You can't be a Christian without having the Spirit of God in you.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.720]   If any men have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of yours.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   The Holy Spirit is in every Christian.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.040]   Very well, says the apostle to Timothy, you seem to have forgotten that.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.080]   You are writing your letters to me, you're dependent upon me, and you're afraid of the
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.600]   future because you think I'm going to be killed.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:08.320]   Timothy says to the apostle, God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:15.400]   and of a sound mind, which means discipline, self-control, orderliness.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.720]   Timothy says to the apostle, you're denying the Holy Spirit that is in you.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.560]   You're behaving as if you'd never received the Spirit.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.160]   That's not the way a Christian behaves.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.800]   You are in a sense denying your whole position.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:36.320]   As a Christian, God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   sound mind.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:43.800]   Therefore, endure thou hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.000]   He goes on to say to Timothy in the second chapter.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.040]   And that's the way we've got to speak to ourselves.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.000]   But I want to go further.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.520]   This fearfulness with respect to the future is not only lack of faith, it's worse, it's
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   unbelief.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.800]   And let's pull it out and look at it and put the appropriate label on it and let's just
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.920]   stize ourselves.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.040]   The whole art of defeating the wiles of the devil is to see that he's at the back of it
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.240]   all and having seen that, to look at yourself and to say, what a fool you are, to listen
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.000]   to him and to be taken in again.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.920]   You address yourself and you condemn yourself.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.480]   You say you're guilty of unbelief.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   How?
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.520]   Well, in this way.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   What about your heavenly Father in whom you claim to believe?
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.120]   You seem to be forgetting him.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.000]   That's what our Lord says in his teaching there in Matthew 6.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.960]   He says, "Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things."
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.920]   Well, very well, why are you worried?
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.760]   If you believe in him at all, if you believe in him as your Father, why not believe that
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.240]   he knows all your needs?
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.480]   Why not go on and remember that the very hairs of your head are all numbered?
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.120]   That no sparrow falls to the ground apart from your heavenly Father?
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.320]   How much greater value are ye than many sparrows?
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.640]   It's your unbelief, this.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.200]   This is to be condemned root and branch.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.880]   Why, my friend, don't you believe that all things work together for good to them that
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   love God?
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   Well, if you do believe it, why are you frightened?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.340]   You've got to believe the promises of the Scripture.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.920]   And if you don't, you're guilty of unbelief.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.840]   That's ultimately the trouble with these people who are guilty in this way of this
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.820]   craven fear of the future.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.440]   It is nothing but sheer unbelief.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.800]   You're not trusting your Father.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.000]   You don't believe he's loved you with an everlasting love.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.520]   You don't know that his care for you is infinitely beyond anything that you can ever
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:54.760]   imagine, that he so loved you that he sent his only begotten Son to die for you.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:03.760]   Very well, round upon it all, and say in the words of John Newton, "Be gone unbelief.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.380]   My Savior is near, and for my relief will surely appear."
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.380]   Attack him in that way.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380]   Attack the devil.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.900]   He's the source of this unbelief.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:21.620]   And then by saying to him, "His grace in times past forbids me to think.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.620]   He'll leave me at last in trouble to think."
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.020]   Show the unreasonableness of the thing.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.260]   Turn with the divine logic of the Scriptures to the devil and say, "No, no, I'm not
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.980]   going to be afraid of the future.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.380]   The God who has done what he's done for me already in his dear Son is not going to
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.780]   abandon me.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:47.420]   He that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.820]   him freely give us all things?"
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.820]   Turn that logic upon him.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.820]   Say, "I'm not afraid of the future.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.540]   The God who saved me in the past, the God who's with me now, is the God who always
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.780]   will be with me.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.380]   All the way my Savior leads me.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.340]   What have I to ask beside?"
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:12.460]   Very well, that's the way to attack this fear of the future that the devil in his wiles
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.100]   so often causes us to fall into.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.420]   But let me go to another matter, which leads out of the two that I've already been dealing
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.260]   with—the whole problem of guidance.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:30.060]   Now, here, I suppose, is one of the commonest of all.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.820]   I've said that I know about many others.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.620]   The fact is they're all common, and the devil repeats them.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.460]   But take this question of guidance.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.060]   Put in with it, if you like, answers to prayer.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.780]   Put in it, if you like, the whole question of faith healing.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.460]   They all belong to the same category.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:51.300]   I think that if I were asked what is it that is troubling more Christian people than anything
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:57.940]   else just at this present moment, I would have to say it's this.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:05.140]   There never has been greater interest, perhaps, in healing, guidance, answers to prayer.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.140]   It's not surprising.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:12.700]   The world is difficult at the moment, and any conscientious Christian person is anxious
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.740]   to do the right thing.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.660]   And here seems to be teaching which says, "Pray to God.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.260]   That's all you've got to do.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.700]   And you'll be told exactly what to do.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.900]   You'll get your exact guidance.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.140]   Or if you're ill, go to the Lord in prayer," and so on.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.140]   Very well.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.820]   Now then, let's see how this problem develops.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.900]   Well, this is how the devil, in his wildness, uses this matter.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.940]   He persuades us to take a mechanical view of it all.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.460]   And what I mean by the mechanical view is this, that it's really quite simple, that
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.860]   there's no problem at all.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.380]   You just go to God and you'll get your guidance.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.300]   You pray to God and you'll get your answer.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.060]   That's the whole meaning of prayer, surely.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.180]   Is there any meaning in the word guidance if it isn't there?
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.180]   There it is.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.380]   Simple, mechanical, direct.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.060]   You get your... you expect it to happen always.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.380]   You expect it to happen in detail always.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.940]   Prayer of faith, what's it mean?
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.980]   Here it is, they say.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.900]   And then, with regard to healing, the argument that it is never God's will that any of his
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.300]   children should be ill.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.060]   How can a loving father allow any of his children to be ill?
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.860]   It is always God's will that we should be well and healthy.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.900]   Therefore, if you're ill, obviously you just ask God to heal you.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.900]   It must happen.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.900]   Now that's the teaching.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:36.060]   And the result of all this, of course, is this, that when these things don't happen,
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.380]   there is disappointment.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.260]   You don't seem to be able to get your guidance.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.020]   Or you thought your head had your guidance, but you found it was wrong.
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.660]   And here you are in trouble.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.060]   You're disappointed.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:58.820]   The healing hasn't taken place in spite of fervent believing prayer, as you thought.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:08.900]   And all this, plus the fear of taking a wrong decision, depresses the believer.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.780]   One begins to turn in upon himself and says, "Am I a Christian at all?
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.300]   If I were a true Christian, surely God would have answered me.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.300]   The thing would have happened.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.300]   I'd know.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.500]   Am I a Christian at all?
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:26.020]   Or if it isn't it, I'm lacking in faith.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.300]   There's something wrong with me somewhere.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.100]   I don't know what it is, but I'm lacking in faith somewhere."
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:37.140]   And the devil encourages you to believe that, and he may use your friends to believe that.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:43.660]   I shall never forget an instance of a very godly and saintly woman who died in sheer
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.260]   spiritual misery.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.260]   Why?
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.980]   Well, for this reason.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:55.220]   The poor woman suddenly developed a growth in her throat, a cancer of the throat.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.740]   And she and two of her great bosom friends began to pray about this, and they were great
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.380]   women of faith and of prayer.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.380]   They were three great saints, and they believed she was going to be healed.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.020]   And they believed they'd been given that assurance.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.060]   But she got worse and worse and worse.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.500]   Then her two friends with the best intentions in the world began to suggest to her, was
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.380]   there some sin she was not confessing?
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.220]   Was there something she was hiding?
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.940]   They didn't know it, but there must be something.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.100]   Or was she lacking in faith?
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.660]   Didn't she really believe what she said?
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.820]   And they reduced her to a state of utter misery, and as I say, she died in that condition.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.580]   Now there was no doubt that she died and went to glory.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.780]   She was a great Christian woman, but she died in spiritual misery, and was encouraged in
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:46.620]   that misery by the wrong teaching of her friends, who had the best intentions and the greatest
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.660]   sympathy possible.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.460]   And so you see the devil, in his wildness, he does all this, and then he comes and says,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.540]   perhaps, yes, your faith's all right.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.540]   It isn't you.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.960]   It's that God isn't keeping his promise.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.420]   You believed in a God of love.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.100]   How can he be a God of love and leave you to suffer like this?
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.780]   How can he be a God of love and not let you know what his will is?
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:17.300]   And so you see, the devil comes from every angle, and the poor soul is dejected and unhappy.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.180]   The result is turmoil, confusion, unhappiness.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:28.660]   And very often their whole faith is shaken to the very depths.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.060]   Now then, what is the answer to this?
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   Well, obviously, it's not an easy matter.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.500]   That's the first thing we've got to say.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.860]   There wouldn't be all this trouble if it were a simple problem.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   It isn't.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.100]   It's one of the most difficult problems in the Christian life.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.940]   I'm simply going to put a number of suggestions to you for you to work out for yourselves.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.140]   Here's the first.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:56.140]   Obviously, this whole matter is not as simple as some of our friends would have us believe.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:02.580]   No, that's the trouble always with the cults.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:09.660]   The characteristic, the hallmark of a cult is that it always makes the thing quite simple.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.780]   You do this, that happens.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.220]   That's the characteristic always of a cult.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.980]   And this teaching is often presented like that.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.980]   They say there's no problem.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.820]   You just go to God, you get your guidance.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.820]   You pray to God, you're healed.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.140]   You ask for God's will, he lets you know.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   It's as simple as that.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.820]   Well, now, I say it is clearly not as simple as that.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.780]   If it were as simple as that, there'd be no problem.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.420]   There'd be no difficulty.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.620]   And there would be no need for the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.060]   There'd be no need for any preaching at all.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.260]   Nothing could ever go wrong.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.700]   But it isn't so.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.300]   And I think I can tell you in the second place why it isn't so.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.460]   And that is that if it were as simple as that, the Christian life would be machine-like,
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.660]   mechanical, automatic.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.060]   It would be just like pulling a lever and the signal drops.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.500]   But you know, the Christian life is not like that.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.580]   That makes it into something almost magical.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.700]   Not only that, if it were as simple as that, there'd never be any growth in the Christian
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.700]   life.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.540]   You can't get growth and development in a machine.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.900]   But where there's life, there's growth and development, and there is in the Christian
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   life.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.860]   And if it all happened automatically, you just make your request and get your answer,
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.620]   there'd be no room for growth.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.500]   And there never is any growth in members of a cult.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.220]   You meet them twenty years after they joined it, you'll find them exactly the same as
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.020]   they were at the beginning, if they're still in it.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.620]   But there's certainly no growth.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.260]   There's no room for growth.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.100]   It all happens at once at the beginning, quite simply.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.980]   And there's no room for growth.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:53.260]   But here, you have babes in Christ, young men, middle-aged, old men, there's ever growth
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.820]   and development and progress.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.780]   But let me go further.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.940]   I would indicate in the third place that there is specific biblical teaching with respect
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.900]   to this.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.020]   The Apostle Paul did not get automatic guidance.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.700]   The Apostle Paul was sometimes in difficulty about his guidance.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.260]   Let me give you an example out of Acts 16.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.780]   In the 16th chapter of Acts, this is what I read in verse 6.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:25.540]   "Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:33.940]   of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, after they had come to Messiah, they assayed
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.220]   to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them not."
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:44.180]   Now the Apostle thought quite clearly that he was to preach in Asia and in Bithynia.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.500]   Where is this man of God, this great Apostle?
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.140]   He believes this is what he's to do.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.660]   The Holy Ghost has to prevent him and prohibit him, specifically.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.940]   And in the same way, he would never have gone to Troas.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:05.660]   He would never have gone from Troas into Macedonia, were it not that God had to intervene even
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.700]   in the form of a vision.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.060]   The Apostle was not clear in his guidance.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:19.580]   And face to face with such an example, I say, we must never teach that guidance is certain,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.380]   automatic, and infallible.
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.380]   It's not true.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.300]   It's not true in apostolic experience.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.700]   Neither has it been true in the history of the saints since then.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:33.660]   You read their biographies, and you'll find that they've had great trouble on this question,
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.340]   and have often done things that were wrong.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.980]   But they haven't lost their faith because of it, for the reason that they never believed
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.140]   in this automatic happening.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.140]   And then, of course, we have the striking case of the Apostle and his thorn in the flesh
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.620]   in 2 Corinthians 12.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:53.500]   Three times he prayed to God with all faith and fervency that this be removed, but it
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.100]   wasn't removed.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.740]   And he came to see why it wasn't.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   It was good for him.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.260]   "When I am weak, then am I strong."
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.580]   It brings him to the point of saying, "Thy grace is sufficient for me.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.420]   Whatever the thorn in the flesh, whatever it is, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.980]   I'm content to go on.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.460]   Let everything minister to thy glory and to thy praise."
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.580]   Trophimus has to be left sick.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.340]   Timothy is told to take a little wine for his stomach.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:25.220]   Now, these are sure facts in the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:31.580]   And as I say, the subsequent history of God's saints and people teaches exactly the same
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.580]   thing.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:37.660]   There is nothing automatic about these matters in the teaching of the Scripture, nor in the
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:38.660]   history of the Church.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.300]   But, say somebody, what about James' teaching about the prayer of faith?
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.820]   Aren't you forgetting that?
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.140]   Well, let's have a look at it and see what it's got to say.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.820]   That may be perfectly fair in these matters.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.620]   The epistle of James, in the fifth chapter, you remember, deals with it and puts it like
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.340]   this.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.340]   "Is any among you afflicted?
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.700]   Let him pray.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.700]   Is any merry?
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.180]   Let him sing songs.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.620]   Is any sick among you?
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.780]   Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.980]   with oil in the name of the Lord.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:19.020]   And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.060]   have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.900]   Now, say somebody, that's as plain as a thing can be.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.780]   Why are you denying that and disputing it?
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.420]   My friend, the answer to you is this.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:37.740]   If that again is as simple as you would have us believe, why doesn't it always happen?
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   That's your problem.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.140]   There are people who believe that as intensely as you are.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:49.220]   Everything there commended has been done, but the sick has not been healed.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.460]   There's your first question.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.820]   That should make you see at once that there may be something wrong with your interpretation
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.980]   of the passage.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:05.140]   But let me give you the parallel passage in Mark 11, reading verses 22 to 24.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:11.740]   And Jesus answering saith unto them, "Have faith in God; for verily I say unto you, that
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:17.300]   whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea,
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:22.600]   and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.820]   come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:34.260]   Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.980]   them, and ye shall have them."
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.000]   Now that's interpreted like this, as you know.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.540]   People say, "Yes, you pray to God, you believe, and you don't even stop at asking God.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.860]   You thank him already, before you get up off your knees.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.980]   You thank God for having heard your prayer of faith, you thank him for what you know
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.900]   for certain is going to happen."
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:02.220]   They say, "That's the prayer of faith."
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:08.060]   But again I say, facts are very stubborn things.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:12.380]   And there are many unhappy and wretched Christians in the world this morning, because they believe
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:17.380]   that kind of teaching wholeheartedly and honestly and sincerely, but the thing they desire does
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.420]   not happen.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.420]   And they don't understand.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.420]   Why not?
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.220]   Well, because they're misinterpreting the scriptures.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.900]   What is the prayer of faith?
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.820]   What is it that enables a man to believe that he's going to receive what he asks for?
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:38.300]   Now that's the crucial question, and the answer seems to me to be perfectly clear.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.060]   You can never bring yourself to that persuasion.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.500]   The fact that you say that you believe it doesn't mean that it's true.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.900]   You can't force yourself, you can't persuade yourself.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.660]   "Well, how does it happen?" says someone.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:55.900]   Well, I suggest to you that the prayer of faith is a prayer that is always given and
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:00.220]   indicted by the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:05.740]   He gives it to you, and when he gives it there is no doubt, there is no uncertainty.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.700]   You're not working yourself up, you're not saying, "I do believe."
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.700]   You're not persuading.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.700]   No, no.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.780]   The Holy Spirit has made it absolutely certain to you.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.980]   Let me use an illustration.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:22.380]   Have you ever noticed in the book of the Acts of the Apostles two things about the healings
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.580]   worked by the apostles?
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.980]   First, they never announced beforehand that they were going to heal.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.380]   The faith healers do that.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.020]   They say, "On Wednesday there will be a healing service in the afternoon."
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.000]   The apostles never did that.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.860]   They never said beforehand that they were going to do it.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   Why not?
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.260]   I think I can tell you.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.820]   They never knew when they were going to do it.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.740]   They didn't believe it was a sort of permanent power that they had, and all they had to do
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.220]   at any given moment was to press the button.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.060]   No, no.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.220]   This is what you find.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.660]   Peter and John go up to the temple at the hour of prayer to pray.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.620]   They see the lame men at the gate.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.660]   He looks up expecting to receive an answer.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.900]   And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said, "What made him do it?
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.860]   I have no doubt whatsoever in answering the question."
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.780]   He was given a commission.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.700]   At that moment the command came.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.900]   The Spirit told him.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.940]   Christ said, "I'm going to do it through you."
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.260]   He knew.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.340]   You find in the same way in Acts 14, Paul preaching at Lystra.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:35.420]   There was an impotent man put to sit in front of him, and Paul perceiving that he had faith
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.500]   to believe spoke to him a commission.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.300]   In other words, I say in the first place they never announced it beforehand because they
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.340]   never knew when it was going to happen.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:54.140]   Secondly, when the apostles set out to heal, they never failed.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.100]   Now I'm talking about the book of Acts of the apostles, not about the Gospels, after
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.100]   Pentecost.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.860]   They never tried and failed.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:06.780]   The modern healers try and fail very often because they're wrong in their whole teaching.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.420]   They've never had the particular command.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.060]   They've never had the particular commission.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.700]   They believe this power is in the church.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.100]   You've only got to exercise it.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.100]   You claim the power.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.340]   You act upon it.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:20.500]   But there are more failures than successes, if there are any genuine successes at all.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   It's a misunderstanding.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.820]   Now then, the meaning of the prayer of faith is this.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.740]   It is a prayer that is given to you by the Spirit.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.300]   You don't command it, I don't.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.420]   You can never make yourself certain that you're going to receive what you're going to ask
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   for.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:42.540]   But God, through the Spirit, will at times give you that consciousness.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.540]   That's it.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.340]   Our Lord always had it, so he could remove mountains.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.980]   There was nothing he couldn't do.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:54.020]   He knew there was this perfect accord, and he was ever doing his Father's works.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:58.460]   He says the works that I do, I do not of myself, but the Father that sent me, he doeth the
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.700]   works.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.340]   And it is the same with us.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:06.060]   It is only as we get into this condition that we are sensitive to the Spirit.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.980]   We shall be given the authority, we shall be given the certainty, we shall be given
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.360]   the commission, and then there never will be a failure.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:20.140]   But if we experiment and try to work ourselves up to it, there will be repeated failure,
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.980]   and consequent dejection and disappointment and unhappiness.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   Very well.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:29.980]   Before I summarize it, I put it like this.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.940]   These things are the exceptions.
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.660]   God has his normal way of guidance and of healing and of all these other matters, and
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.460]   that is through means.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:45.900]   We are meant to get our guidance through the Scriptures, through an enlightened spiritual
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:52.020]   mind and understanding, through an enlightened reason, through an enlightened conscience.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:56.860]   And so normally God guides us, thank God he does, and he gives us certainty through these
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   methods.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.380]   You read your Scriptures and their teaching, you apply it.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.780]   If you are in trouble, go and consult another, hence your pastors and teachers and older
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   Christians.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:11.260]   Bring it all together, get the mind of the Church, as it were, upon it, and then through
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:19.340]   circumstances God will manipulate them and use them, and on top of it all.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.660]   There is such a thing as a pressure upon the mind and upon the heart, something you can't
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.140]   get rid of.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.860]   You sometimes wish you could, but you can't.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.340]   God is giving you some kind of general indication through a pressure on your mind that you are
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.380]   meant to do this, and you can't get rid of the thought, "Well, these are the ways in
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:44.260]   which God normally guides his people."
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:52.420]   So that I would lay down as the ultimate rules of procedure something like this.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.460]   Never make a claim in the presence of God.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.220]   Don't claim healing.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.960]   Don't claim guidance.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:05.220]   You and I don't claim in the presence of God, we come as humble suppliants.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.980]   Don't talk about claiming this or that, there's no such thing.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:12.500]   That's the tragedy of this modern teaching, and hence its confusion.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.500]   Don't talk about claiming.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.100]   Well, what do you do then?
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:19.860]   Well, you commit yourself and all your affairs to God.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.340]   Commit everything to God.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.620]   Illness, future, guidance, everything.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.540]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:35.540]   Tell him that you have one desire, is to know his will and to do it.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:39.840]   Now, if you can't be honest at that point, you might as well stop.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:45.900]   You start with yourself and you say, "Can I honestly say to God that I desire nothing
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:51.860]   but to know his will and to do that will, whatever it is?
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.500]   Whether I'm to go abroad or stay at home, whether I'm to be sick or whether I'm to
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.340]   be well, whether I'm to get married or not married, whatever it is, can I say honestly
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:07.300]   to God, 'Lord, my supreme desire is to know thy will and to do it, whatever it is?'"
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.820]   Tell him that if you can.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:18.340]   And then having said that to God, remind yourself that he is your Father.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.980]   And therefore leave it with God.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.340]   Don't you think too much about it after leaving it with God.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.660]   It's his problem, now it's not yours.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.180]   Don't pray to God and then get up and start thinking again and going, "Lord, you haven't
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.180]   believed in your prayer."
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.180]   Leave it with God.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.800]   Tell him that honestly and leave it with him.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.880]   Don't think too much about it now.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.060]   But go on doing what you're meant to do.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.220]   Do your work.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:46.580]   Be observant, keep your eyes open, be ready at any point for some indication of God's
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.580]   will.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.680]   Just be on the alert, but don't be anxious.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.940]   Never be anxious.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.700]   In nothing be anxious.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.140]   Refuse worry, refuse anxiety.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   Leave it with God.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.660]   Go on with your work.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:11.600]   And finally I would say this, never act against that inner voice.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.340]   In other words, you may find yourself as the result of doing what I've been saying, that
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.760]   you've come to a point when everything seems to indicate that you should do that thing.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:27.880]   But if there is a feeling within you that you shouldn't, don't do it.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.760]   Always act as a whole.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.800]   Never move until you're unanimous.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.080]   Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.160]   Read the end of Romans 14.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.600]   If there's any doubt, "He that doubteth is damned," says the apostle.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   He's wrong.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.280]   If there's a doubt left inside you which you can't even understand, something irrational
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.360]   almost, but it's very powerful, don't act against it, whatever your mind and reason,
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.920]   whatever everybody else may say.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:09.360]   I don't hesitate to teach this, that a man seeking guidance, a man trying to live God's
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.480]   will in this world is like a great train in Paddington or Waterloo or somewhere.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.800]   There it is, everything's ready.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.360]   And the passengers are all in, the steam is up.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.200]   The train isn't moving, why not?
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.360]   The signal hasn't dropped.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.640]   And the train doesn't move, though everything is ready, until that final signal is dropped.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:41.040]   I am asserting that the final signal is this deep consciousness within.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.360]   That's the last signal.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.880]   Never act against it.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.840]   Never act against your conscience.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.920]   Never act against this inward sense.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:57.180]   But if that is all right and agrees with all the rest, go straight ahead.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.080]   And what guarantees, says somebody, have I now, that I'm right?
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.920]   You've been shaking my confidence, my dear friend, what I'm telling you is this.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:13.280]   If you do what I've just been saying, whatever the consequences, you will not suffer.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.480]   You have acted as God's child should act.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:22.600]   And God knowing you and knowing your motives will not punish you.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.240]   He may prevent the thing you desire for your own good, and you'll thank him for it later
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240]   on.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   But if you act scripturally, conscientiously, and according to these rules, you can do no
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.560]   more.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:45.840]   And I do not hesitate to assert that God expects no more of you.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.880]   You've submitted to his will, whatever it may be.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:58.080]   And anybody who's in that position is to be blessed of God and will be blessed of God.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.800]   Very well, I say, let us beware of the subtle teachings of the devil that are around and
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:11.720]   about us today in the cults and in other ways that would reduce all this great mystery of
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:17.080]   God's relationship to his children and our growth and development in grace to something
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.200]   mechanical and machine-like.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:28.400]   Let us then as men quit ourselves as men and use the means that God has given us.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.920]   And if it be God's will for something unusual in our particular case, well, you can take
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   it from me.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.840]   He'll make it very plain and clear.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.360]   There'll be no question about it.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.720]   If it's the miraculous, there'll be the authority and the certainty that he gave his
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.680]   apostles and he will give it to you.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:54.920]   Well, may God enable us, one by one and together, to realize something of the wiles of the devil
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:02.960]   that we may realize our need of the whole armor of God and the need of being strong
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.280]   in his might and in his almighty power.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.360]   To that end, let us join in singing the hymn number 396.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.080]   We'll omit the fifth verse.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:24.640]   "Omitting," verse 5, "begone unbelief, my Savior is near."
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:47.120]   [music]
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   [music]
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   [music]
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   [music]
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   [music]
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   [music]
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   [music]
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   [music]
