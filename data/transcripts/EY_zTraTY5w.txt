[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   (Music)
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Pastor John, my name is Jeremy and I am a college student living in Arlington, Texas.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   I love the Word of God and it often takes me a long time for me to read through a book of the Bible.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   In episode number 127, you mentioned slowing down in the rose garden,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   which has been so beneficial and wonderful.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   However, as a Christian who did not grow up in the church, I'm not familiar with all the Bible.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So how do I both stop and enjoy God's truth one verse at a time,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   but also satisfy this desire to know the Bible as a whole?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I love the desire. Amen. Amen.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I have something to suggest to Jeremy, but first let me say a word about depth and breadth.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Because we all struggle with this. The balancing, if that's even the right word,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   between going deep with the Bible and going broad with the Bible.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   What do we even mean by that? I want to just say a word about that and then give a concrete piece of advice.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Take depth. What do I mean by depth? Let's give an example.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Here's 2 Thessalonians. So you're reading along, pretty good clip, trying to get through a chapter or two in the morning,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and you read 2 Thessalonians 2.12, which says, "They did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And as you're moving along real quick, what registers is, okay, those are two things to avoid.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Don't be disbelieving in the truth, and don't take pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   On to the next verse. And what I mean by depth is that you stop.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You don't go on to the next verse. You stop and you ask—this takes time, right?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You can't be reading the next verse when you do this.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   What's the relationship between not believing the truth and taking pleasure in unrighteousness?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Why did Paul make them alternatives? Why didn't he say, "They did not believe the truth, but believed a lie"?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He didn't say that. Why didn't he say, "They did not take pleasure in righteousness, but in unrighteousness"?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Why didn't he say that? He didn't say that. He said, "They did not believe the truth, but," as though it were an alternative,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   "took pleasure in unrighteousness." Odd. Why juxtapose unrighteousness and truth and belief and pleasure?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   What's going on here? I mean, this is what I mean by depth.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And I think you say, "Hmm, hmm. Didn't I just read the word 'truth' back in verse 10?"
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You go back, pick up verse 10. "They refused to love the truth."
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Oh, now you've got love the truth, not just believe the truth. And love sounds sort of like taking pleasure in so.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And now you're into a series of thoughts that take you down deep into the very nature of faith,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   which has to do with what you rest in, what you embrace, what you treasure, and not just what you think is true.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, that may take you 10 minutes to do what I just did there, or longer.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And you might jot it down in your journal, and as you're writing it in your journal,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   two new thoughts about pleasure and unrighteousness come to your mind,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and suddenly you've filled up your morning half hour, and you've read one verse.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So there's the struggle, right? If you're going to do that every day, it'll take you 80 years to read your Bible.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Right, exactly.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Or more. So I'm a great believer in slowing down and thinking, thinking, thinking.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   However, on the other hand, I believe in breadth. I mean, all Scripture is inspired by God.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And here's an example. By breadth, I mean reading broadly enough so that you take in the entire 500-year period,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   say, of the divided kingdom in Israel, from Rehoboam right down to the end of the exile.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, king after king after king, rising, falling, succeeding, failing,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   good, then evil, evil, then good, a rotten father followed by a good son,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   a good father followed by a rotten son, and on and on.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I don't know of any other way but reading through those books broadly to get the profound sense
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   of both the repeated failure and rebellion of God's people over centuries,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and the extraordinary mercy and patience of God.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I mean, you can read the sentence "great patience of God" in the New Testament,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and you'll have certain affections and feelings and responses,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   but when you take a month to read these four books—1 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles—
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   you just come away saying, "Good night! How in the world did God tolerate such rebellion?"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And then you realize, "Oh, look in the mirror, and how many times—"
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   There's just no other way quite to get what God has to give us if we ignore the broad,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   doing only the deep that I described earlier.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So my answer to Jeremy is mix deep and broad in various ways that suit your mind and your life.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So here, concretely suggestion. What about this, Jeremy?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Set aside a block of time in the morning to go deeper.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You'll take a smaller passage of Scripture, and you'll perhaps memorize one of the verses in the Scripture.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You will open a journal, and you'll write down some thoughts about what you saw in the verse you memorized,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   or some other verse.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   This may mean that you only cover a paragraph in the morning or two verses in the morning,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and the encouragement is you're going to have grown remarkably when you do that.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   You will. You will.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Then, here's my suggestion, set aside a time maybe just before you go to bed,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   because it's okay to fall asleep at the end of this, or maybe halfway through.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Set aside some time in the evening to do the big block reading.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And here, you don't have your journal open, and you're not trying to memorize anything.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You're just trying to get the sense of the whole as you read more quickly and more broadly.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   That's one possible way of mixing up the deep and the broad.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Another would be to take a month and do only deep, or a month and do only broad, or a year.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You might say, "This is the year I'm going to get through the whole Bible, so four chapters a day.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I'm not going to worry about depth. I'm going to get the whole thing read."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Or you might take a whole year and say, "All in Philippians," or "All in Romans," or something like that.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And so I might mention one other thing.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   If you're not familiar with the Bible—it sounded like Jeremy might have come out of a background where he's just not familiar with the stories—
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   two suggestions. Get a book like, say, Vaughan Roberts' God's Big Picture,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   or get a good study Bible like the ESV Study Bible,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   and walk through the whole Bible reading the introductions to the biblical books,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   or reading some of those really good essays that summarize the whole Bible.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   So don't think that you have to do everything inductively, that just reading it for yourself.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Do that, by all means, but there are great helps out there.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And just always remember, whatever you do, never, never stop reading.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   This is God's very Word, broad or deep.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It is His transforming voice.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And speaking of slowing down and thinking slowly about one particular text,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Pastor John is doing this very thing every week.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's something we call "Look at the Book."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   If you're not familiar with "Look at the Book," you should check it out.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Pastor John marks up a text on a screen right before your eyes,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and you can watch him as he draws circles and lines and makes connections in the text at a granular level.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You can find those videos online at DesiringGod.org/labs.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Tomorrow we close out the week with a listener who wants to know how much of our decision-making is emotional in nature,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and should we be concerned by that.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Pastor John will answer that tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Don't miss this episode.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
