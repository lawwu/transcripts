[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   So a few more questions. I'm going to give quick answers, Jesse, because I know we're
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.840]   running a little late. So I'm going to be pithy. Sounds good. Next question is from Shibuzo,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.320]   a health administrator in Nigeria. I find that I'm always excited to start things,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.440]   but struggle with finishing them. I'm constantly having competing overdue tasks on my assant.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.240]   Where do I begin to stop this habit? Ah, typo. I think that's a sauna.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.040]   They got typoed in there. Okay. So he must be using a sauna for, for his tasks. All right.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.640]   If you're not completing things on time, there's two issues. Either your plans are unrealistic.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.280]   So you're giving yourself too much to do or your execution is too unfocused.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.480]   So you have a reasonable load of things to do. You're just not doing it.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.600]   Two different types of solutions, unrealistic plans. You want to do multi-scale planning.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.400]   Here's what I'm working on this quarter of those things. Here's what I'm working on this week
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.440]   of those things. Here's what I'm working on today. So you can see the whole ball game. You're not
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.960]   just bouncing around randomly. You also should use doubling heuristics, whatever lists you think is
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.200]   reasonable for you to do today, cut it in half. However much time you think you should give
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.800]   yourself to complete a project, double it. So if you use those doubling heuristics,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.920]   because people are bad at estimating how long things take place and you use multi-scale planning,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080]   you'll get a better grip over what are we working on? What's the reasonable load?
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.200]   If your issue is unfocused execution, you need the time block plan. Otherwise, you're just bouncing
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   through the day emails here, they're hoping that your energy carries you through execution.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.800]   That's not sustainable. That's not scalable. Give every minute of your workday a job,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.320]   make a reasonable plan for the time you have available, force yourself to actually make
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.400]   decisions about given this time, what do I actually want to do? And when's the best time to do it?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   That's how things get done. Not just going randomly through a day with seven inboxes
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.400]   and WhatsApp open and just continually asking yourself, what do I feel like doing next?
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.400]   All right, let's roll.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:10.320]   [MUSIC]
