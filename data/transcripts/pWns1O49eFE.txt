[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   When I talked to Ramit Sethi about money, he has this Ramit's money rules.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.320]   They just really simplify his decision-making about things because he just took the
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   uncertainty out of it. So he says, "If someone is raising money for charity, I always give money.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.560]   If I fly for more than five hours or whatever the number is, I always fly business class."
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.640]   And it just makes it super simple because he's thought about the decision
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.520]   abstractly from actually having to make it. He's like, "I always buy books. If I want to
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.880]   learn something and a book might have the answer, I always buy it. I never stress out
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.840]   if it's $10 or $12 or $20. I just always buy it." Talk about this Bill of Rights because it seems
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.840]   like something that I and maybe everyone listening would benefit from having.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   Yes. And we all have one. It might be a very short list of rights
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   or it might be a long list of rights. The more socially not free you are, the more you're in
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   the cage, the shorter your Bill of Rights. A Bill of Rights is just a statement of permissions.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.240]   I'm allowed to. I have a right to. And you'll know what's in your Bill of Rights based on how
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.600]   you feel and what you do. So do I have a right to say no to that person requesting I come to their
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.280]   thing? Well, did you say yes when you didn't want to go? Then you might not have a right that says
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.080]   I get to say no to people's requests, people's invitations. And this gets... You might say,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.760]   I have a right to repeatedly say no to someone's requests. That's a different thing. And here's
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.840]   some core ones that I encourage people to adopt and make sure they have on their Bill of Rights.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.560]   I have a right to ask for what I want. I have a right to say no. I have a right to
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.960]   approach anyone, whether that's virtually or in person. Doesn't mean they want to talk to you,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.600]   but if you stop yourself before you even allow the opening or the approach,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.160]   you're going to limit your life significantly. And people have all kinds of stories. Oh,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.080]   I'm going to bother them. Oh, hey, I don't know. Maybe they'll be bothered. Maybe they won't.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.400]   Let's find out. You know, in the case of the person wanting to hire you for your services,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.000]   right? I have a right to ask for whatever fee I want for my services, whatever feels right.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.440]   And so the longer... Actually, it's an exercise. It's very much worth doing. And I do it with
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.280]   clients. It's like having to sit down and like, well, write it out. It doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.520]   What would feel empowering to you? What as you write it, you're kind of nodding your head being
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.920]   like, yeah, all right. And then just come up with a list of five, 10. And this is your... Like a
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.680]   nation that has a Bill of Rights for its people, this is your Bill of Rights for you. And those
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.880]   must first be written and then they have to be practiced. Otherwise, they're just flowery
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.400]   language on paper if you're not actually doing them. Are there a few more examples you can give
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   to inspire people as they're hopefully thinking about what would be on theirs? Yeah. I mean,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.000]   I think one thing to break it down is just think of the different areas of your life, right? So
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.280]   you think about in your relationship, your romantic relationship, right? I have a right to
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.840]   tell my partner when something's bothering me. And now it might sound real simple, but a lot of
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.440]   people shy away. I don't want to upset them. I don't want to bother them. You know, I have a
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.800]   right to... Oh, here's a... This one I had to add to my Bill of Rights. It's a doozy. I have a right
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.920]   to disappoint people. Particularly, I have a right to disappoint my partner. Talk about that. Yeah.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   Well, that one was like, you know, I would be running around in my whole life trying not to
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.520]   disappoint anybody. I don't want to have anyone be let down. And look, you know, it's great to
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.720]   be connected with your spouse and not just constantly not give a crap and disappoint
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.040]   them all over the place. Sure. But no matter how loving you're trying to be, how generous you're
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.000]   trying to be, if you're being authentic and true to what you really want, sometimes you're going
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   to disappoint them. They want you to go to that thing and you don't want to go. They want to have
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.880]   time to connect with you but you are unavailable for whatever reason. And so being able to say no
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:23.120]   and then withstand that discomfort of someone is disappointed in me. And the reason I created that
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.120]   Bill of Rights for myself is because I lived with this kind of chronic background anxiety that
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.440]   someone somewhere was going to be disappointed with me. And so just to be like, yeah, I have a
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.560]   right to sometimes people disappointed with me and I have a right to do that sometimes and really
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.400]   resting on that. That's what it feels like. It feels like you can rest on your Bill of Rights
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.840]   and like all as well. Like I'm allowed to do that. And it's almost like,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.280]   like, you know, teaching a child, like, hey, you're allowed to do this, but we kind of have
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480]   to do that for our own, our own selves now. So you can look at that relationship life,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.960]   look at inside of your career and your work. What do you, you know, unique to your thing? I have a
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.000]   right to ask a question in a meeting. I have a right to disagree with somebody. That's a big one.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.560]   And you can think about it socially too, right? Like I, this is a great one. I have a right to
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.280]   change the subject of a conversation. I guess nice people can get trapped on the rails, right? Oh,
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.200]   we're talking about their thing. I don't want to talk. How do I get out of this? And then they
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.040]   pause for a minute. And because you don't have a right to change the subject, instead of changing
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.280]   the subject, you say, Hmm, tell me more. And then the conversation keeps going and you're trapped,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.400]   right? I lived in that one for a long time. So I have a right to change the subject. Ooh, here's
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.160]   a good one. I have a right to interrupt people, right? Cause sometimes you're talking to someone
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.880]   and they're going on and on and on. And you guys say, Hey, I want to ask you something. That's a
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.760]   great technique for interrupting by the way, as if it just came to you, Hey, right in the middle
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.840]   of their sentence, blah, blah, blah. Hey, I just thought of something. I wanted to ask you something
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.620]   and then boom, you can steer it a new direction.
