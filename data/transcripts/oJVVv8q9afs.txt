[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Today's question is about depression, and it comes to us from an anonymous listener.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.520]   "Pastor John, about a year ago I was going through one of the lowest times of depression in my entire
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.880]   life. During this time I was reading scripture. I came across Proverbs 31, verses 6 and 7, which say
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.280]   this, "Give strong drink to him who is perishing, and wine to him whose life is bitter. Let him
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.960]   drink and forget his poverty, and remember his trouble no more." That seems like exactly what
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.680]   I didn't need. Does this passage teach us to use alcohol in numbing the pain of depression?"
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   Let's read these verses, Proverbs 31, 6 and 7, in context. So here's verses 4 through 9,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.080]   and they're very short. "It is not for kings, O Lemuel." So this is Lemuel's mother. You know that
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.520]   early in the context. This is Lemuel's mother teaching him about how to be a king.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.600]   "It is not for kings, O Lemuel. It is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.000]   lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.520]   Give strong drink to the one who's perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.080]   Let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more. Open your mouth
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.960]   for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth, judge righteously,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.160]   defend the rights of the poor and needy." So there's the context. On both sides of the verse
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.880]   about giving drink to the one who's perishing, the stress is, "Don't pervert the rights of the
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.320]   afflicted. Judge righteously, defend the poor, and as a means to that end, watch out for strong drink.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.160]   It unfits the mind for the kind of thinking that leaders have to do in order to do justice.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.840]   So Lemuel's mother is picking up on a theme that runs through the Old Testament
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:35.760]   about alcohol and how it distorts reality and unfits the mind for responsible action and therefore
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   should be used with the greatest caution. Let me just give you a taste of that theme that she's
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:51.520]   picking up on. Ecclesiastes 10, 17, "Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:01.040]   and your princes feast at the proper time for strength and not for drunkenness." In other words,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.280]   happy when you have princes that don't abuse their alcohol. What happens when leaders give
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.560]   themselves to strong drink? 1 Kings 16, 9, "When Asa the king was at Tirzah drinking himself drunk
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.640]   at the house of Arzah, who was over the household of Tirzah, Zimri came and killed him." Or
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.000]   1 Kings 20, 16, "When Ben-Hadad the foreign king was drinking himself drunk in the booths
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   they attacked him and defeated him." Or Isaiah 28, 7, "The priest and the prophet
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.920]   reel with strong drink." They are swallowed by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   reel in vision. They stumble in giving judgment. That's what Lemuel's mother is so concerned about.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:01.280]   Or Hosea 4, 10, "Hoard him wine and new wine. Take away the understanding." That's what she's
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.040]   so concerned about. Or Proverbs 20, verse 1, "Wine is a mocker. Strong drink is a brawler. Whoever
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.920]   partakes is led astray by it and is not wise." Or Proverbs 23, 31, "Do not look at wine when it is
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. In the end it bites like a serpent and
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   stings like an adder. Your eyes will see strange things and your heart will utter perverse things."
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.000]   This is not what kings should do, Lemuel's mother is saying. Your heart must stay clear. Your eyes
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   must be open. Your mind must be sharp so that you can utter just and wise things. So the greatest
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   concern of this passage is verse 5, "Lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:05.120]   the rights of the afflicted." Now that leaves two possible meanings for these words inserted here
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:13.760]   about—let me read them. "Give strong drink to the one who's perishing and wine to those bitter in
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.080]   distress. Let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more." Now here's two
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.160]   possible meanings for that in that particular context. One, use strong drink like we use morphine.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   If someone is perishing and in great pain, use the means at your disposal to relieve the pain.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.840]   Give strong drink to the one who is perishing. I don't think—this is his specific answer to his
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.640]   question—I don't think that justifies us in using alcohol to escape our sorrows or our mental
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:02.000]   miseries. That would not relieve the symptoms of sorrow but would cut us off from the real remedy,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.960]   namely knowing clearly the truth of God in Christ. So that's the first possible meaning. Use it like
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.720]   morphine. I mean, that's the way it's been used in history. Every TV western I've ever seen, when
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.360]   they're gonna cut off the guy's finger, they give him whiskey, right? Well, so would I. I mean, come on.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.840]   Just like I'm so thankful today for pain medication. Number two, and this is what most of the
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.480]   commentators I've looked at believe is the case, namely that this is irony. This is Lemuel's mother
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.760]   who has just told her son that the king should beware of strong drink, and then she says,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:47.200]   "Give it to the miserable." Tremper Longman, in his commentary, suggests that she would be saying
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.840]   this. This is a quote, "Don't act like those derelicts who drink to forget their hardships.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.520]   Be like the king you are." So it's irony. It's saying, "Go ahead and give it to them to do with
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:09.280]   it what they do, but you're the king, and you don't use alcohol that way." Now, frankly, I'm just not
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.040]   sure which of those, but both of them, I think, would be legitimate interpretations of these
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:23.840]   verses. In either case, she's not teaching her son or us in our very low and discouraging moments
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:35.440]   to damage our ability to see the truth that can heal us deeply. Don't open your mouth to obscure
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.640]   reality. Open your mouth to make right judgments. In other words, don't open your mouth to take in
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.840]   the very thing that would make you blind to the truth that can heal you. Open your mouth as a king
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.960]   to speak right things, and open your ears to hear right things that would deliver you from misjudgment.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.480]   That's a good exposition. Thank you, Pastor John. And thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John
