[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Today we're joined by Dr. Vern Poitras, who lives and works at Westminster Theological
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.960]   Seminary just north of Philly, and it's a huge honor to have you on the podcast. Dr.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   Poitras, thanks for being here.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.880]   Well, thank you for inviting me. I consider it a privilege to be here.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.200]   Of course. Well, some of our listeners will not know you well, so here's your CV in brief.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.000]   You have degrees from Cambridge and Harvard and Caltech, and of course, Westminster Theological
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.760]   Seminary where you now work and live. You've been editing the Westminster Theological Journal
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.880]   since 2005, and you serve as professor of New Testament interpretation at the school.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.400]   That's amazing in and of itself, but you've written several books on a range of topics
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.920]   that include the Mosaic Law, the Book of Revelation. You have a book on inerrancy, and one on Bible
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.040]   interpretation, and one on logic, and a book on worldview, one on science, one on sociology,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.880]   one on linguistics, and a book on chance and probability. That book is titled Chance in
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.160]   the Sovereignty of God, a God-Centered Approach to Probability and Random Events, published
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   in 2014. That book, I mean, Chance in the Sovereignty of God, when I read it, I was
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.880]   just blown away. It's an excellent book, and I wanted to have you on for a long time to
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.000]   talk about coin tossing and casinos. So let's start with casting lots today, and then we'll
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.200]   talk about casinos tomorrow. I'm no mathematician, and I don't have a PhD from Harvard, but by
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.520]   my count, I see about 30, over 30 references, I think, in the Bible to casting lots. I mean,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.560]   what exactly is this, this casting of lots?
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.480]   Right. It's a good question. The main cases where there is more explanation are religiously
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.080]   sanctioned, divinely sanctioned cases, so they're very special. For instance, when Achan
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.160]   has sinned against the Lord by taking some of the gold and silver out of Jericho when
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.520]   it's conquered, and God announces that there's been a violation of His commands. So God says
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:27.080]   somebody has sinned, but nobody but God knows who it is. And then lots are cast under Joshua's
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   supervision to find out who it is. Well, God already knows who it is. So this is, it is
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.880]   a very special episode, and there's casting lots to decide on the replacement for Judas
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.160]   in at the end of Acts 1. And that's because they, you read through that, and it's again
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.840]   a case where the apostles know that Judas should be replaced, and Peter cites an Old
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.760]   Testament prophesy to that effect. And God knows who He wants, but they don't. But these
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.040]   are very special because it's special leaders like Joshua, whom God instructs, and it's
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   in a time where God is giving direct revelation about His will to specially chosen people,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.680]   people like the prophets and the apostles. So it's very special. There may also have
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.960]   been cases where people gambled or whether they did things frivolously, but the Bible
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.560]   doesn't say much about that.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.920]   Yeah, and I want to come back to Acts 1 in just a moment, but does anyone know what casting
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.040]   lots look like? I mean, was this a two-sided stone or what was it?
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.440]   Yeah, well, we don't know all the details, but it's something like rolling dice. But
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.000]   our modern dice have six sides, and it may have been, as you say, two-sided, but we don't
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.360]   know the details. And of course, it doesn't matter because these special things are once
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.520]   for all events. So God is not saying this should be a regular practice.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.200]   Right. And yet we have Proverbs 16, 33, which says, "The lot is cast into the lap, but
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.640]   it's every decision is from the Lord." So aren't lots that are cast and coins that
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.640]   are tossed and dice that are rolled, aren't those always under God's sovereign control?
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.200]   Right. Well, every flip of the coin is under God's control. There are many passages,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   I think, indicate that God's control of the world is comprehensive. Even the hairs
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.480]   of your head are numbered. If a sparrow falls to the ground, it's not apart from the will
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.840]   of God. Now, a lot of modern people have lost sight
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   of that, and I think it's unhealthy spiritually to lose sight of that, because we are in the
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   care of our Heavenly Father, and it matters that we affirm and really believe that with
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.280]   respect to details, as well as respect to the big issues of history. But what I would
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.480]   answer, you know, is this, does this give us the will of God? That's often how it's
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.520]   framed. And I think you have to make a distinction between two ways of asking that question.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.920]   It needs to be illustrated. So take the crucifixion of Christ. All the events that happened there
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.120]   happened according to the divine plan. God was working out salvation for us. So there's
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.440]   one sense of the will of God. It's the will of God for history, for every event in history.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.320]   But that's distinct from asking, did God morally approve of the actions of the high priest
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.880]   or of Herod and Pilate? And the answer is, no, he didn't. It was highly unjust. So moral
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.600]   approval is quite distinct from saying God sovereignly planned it. And when the coin
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.200]   flips, what we know from Scripture teaching is God sovereignly planned how it would come
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.720]   out. But that gives us no information about his moral will. It's quite different. And
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.800]   people make a mistake. I know there's, you know, immature people out there who think,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.440]   I'm not sure what God's moral will for me is. I'll find out by flipping a coin. That's
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.520]   a misunderstanding of how God reveals his moral will.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.480]   And yet coin tosses are never prohibited in Scripture. I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.800]   Christians, I don't think should use coin flips to divine God's moral will, of course.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.240]   Like you said, we don't need it. We have the revealed word. And yet Scripture never equates
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.400]   coin tosses with the evils of divination, soothsaying, magic, or necromancy, it seems.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.200]   Dr. Griffin Yeah, that's right. But I think you're also right to point to the fact there
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.760]   is discussion. For instance, Deuteronomy 18, there's other passages, but in Deuteronomy
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.240]   18, it's one that has a whole list of ways that in the ancient world, people sought for
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   security. That's a basic issue. They want to know something that would help their decision
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.880]   making and escape tragedy in the future. Fortune telling nowadays, and a lot of the things
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.720]   of consulting mediums, is trying to obtain secret knowledge that will give you extra
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.960]   security. And it's condemned in the Bible, not only because it is wrong, but because
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   it's a violation of the fundamental principle of serving God alone. We ought to rely on
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.720]   God and not on those other things. And so it's a form of idolatry in the end, and it's
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.240]   serious. I mean, I know some Christians who've come from a pagan background, they may not
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.320]   even realize immediately, "Stay away from this. It is condemned in the Bible." And it's
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.240]   unfortunate that this kind of thing is growing, and I continue to see it grow because people
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.200]   who no longer know God in a saving relationship, they're still hungry for God, or they're hungry
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.680]   for security. A security, which I say, we find in God being, becoming our Heavenly Father.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.880]   He has a fatherly care for everything that happens in our lives. If you don't have that,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.040]   where do you go? You go to substitutes. You go to the fortune tellers, or you have a rabbit's
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   foot, for instance, you know, for good luck. You carry around, or some special thing that
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.960]   you think gives you good luck. If God is in charge, that's ridiculous. And as I say, it
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.840]   is really an insult to God because you're not relying on him, you're relying on this
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840]   other thing.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.040]   Yeah. Acts 126, the choosing of Matthias, it's the last mention of casting lots in the
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:50.280]   Bible. And then Pentecost unfolds in the very next verse. I mean, redemptive historically
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.200]   does the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit somehow replace for the Christian life coin
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   flips.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:04.480]   Yeah. The Bible doesn't spell it all out, but it does seem logical because when the
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.620]   Holy Spirit is poured out in Pentecost, it gives us a new fullness of understanding the
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.240]   mind of God. It's not as if the Holy Spirit isn't at work in the Old Testament, but this
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:21.000]   is a new fullness. It's the Spirit of Christ poured out from the ascended Christ. And Paul
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.600]   talks in 1 Corinthians 2 at the end about, we have the mind of Christ. Well, it doesn't
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.880]   make us divine, but it means we have a fundamental in Christ as we fellowship with him, we have
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:41.000]   a fundamental understanding of who God is and in communion with him, that gives us wisdom
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.180]   that we use in our decision making. And too often I feel that Christian people even may
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.720]   seek for answers to hard decisions. Yeah, we have to face hard decisions and they seek
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.040]   for answers by some mechanical formula or some trick or some kind of magic, but that
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.480]   isn't what it's about. It's about fellowship with a God who made you and who has expressed
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.840]   his love for you in Christ and has given you the Holy Spirit so that you may be filled
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:16.680]   with wisdom. And you have to grow into that, of course, but through their wisdom, you begin
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.840]   to move with more and more confidence, even with difficult decisions. Of course, you continue
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.760]   to pray. Of course, you continue to read your Bible, but there's a fundamental confidence
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.120]   God is for me, not because of what I did, anything I did, or not because I used some
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.520]   formula, but because of Christ. Yes, amen. That is a good word. And it's a good place
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.400]   to stop for now. Really, all of this discussion today sets up a question for tomorrow, and
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.960]   that is, why do casinos always win in the end? So I'm looking forward to addressing
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.320]   that tomorrow. To follow up on today's topic of how do we as Christians approach the many
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.600]   decisions of life in communion with Christ, see what Pastor John recently said in episode
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.200]   number 799, where we talked about the little acronym he uses called Aptat. If you didn't
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.840]   listen to that, check it out. It's episode number 799, just a few days ago. And there
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.000]   you'll find more reasons why we make decisions in communion with Christ. Well, for our apps
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and for past episodes, and to get us a question, find us online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you tomorrow with guest Dr. Vern Poythress.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   [END]
