[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.840]   the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter and the eighth verse.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.320]   The eighth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.960]   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.120]   whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.040]   This verse comes as a part of the account of this amazing, extraordinary meeting that
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.800]   took place between the Lord Jesus Christ and a man called Nicodemus, who was a master and
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.600]   a teacher in Israel.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.280]   You remember how this man came seeking an interview with our Lord, and he'd been impressed
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.520]   by his preaching and his miracles, and he was anxious to know what it was that this
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.920]   new teacher had which he lacked.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.520]   And so he went to see him.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.200]   But you remember our Lord interrupted the statement of Nicodemus by saying, "Except
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.240]   a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.720]   And our Lord goes on to instruct him, "Nicodemus doesn't understand these things.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.480]   How can a man be born, he says, when he is old?
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.760]   Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?"
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.440]   Our Lord answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.040]   of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.040]   Marvel not that I said unto thee, "Ye must be born again."
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   And then comes this verse that we're looking at where the man who is born of the Spirit
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.960]   is reminded that what has happened to him is something comparable to the action of the
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   wind.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   "The wind bloweth where it listeth, though hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.200]   whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit."
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.720]   But Nicodemus still doesn't understand and says, "How can these things be?"
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.320]   Jesus answered and said unto him, "Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   things?
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.760]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify that we have
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.160]   seen, and ye receive not our witness.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.760]   If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   you of heavenly things?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   And no man hath ascended up unto heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.880]   of Man which is in heaven."
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.320]   Now, the great thing that's impressed upon us there, of course, is the mysterious character
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.200]   of this Christian life.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   It is a mystery from beginning to end.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.280]   Poor Nicodemus, his trouble was that he was trying to understand things that can't be
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   understood.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.080]   He was a religious man, and we who meet here regularly have been examining this great passage
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.360]   for a number of weeks in order to show the essential difference between merely being
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.000]   religious and being Christian.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.080]   Before a man can be a Christian, he's got to be born again.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.960]   He's brought into a new realm.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.720]   He's in the realm of the miraculous, the supernatural.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.040]   And it is idol, it is folly to bring your natural human understanding, as Nicodemus
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.280]   did.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.080]   The man who tries to understand these things is of necessity baffled, and he'll never
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.480]   experience their grace and glory and power.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.960]   Well now, that's the great and essential message of this passage, and of course it
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.840]   leads us very naturally, doesn't it, into what we are considering together this morning,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   being Easter Sunday morning.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   There is an ancient tradition that when the first Christians used to meet one another,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.560]   they greeted one another with this phrase, "Christ is risen."
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.280]   That was their ordinary form of salutation.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.360]   The Jews used to greet one another by saying, "Peace be unto you."
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.840]   But the Christians had this new salutation, and it was, "Christ is risen."
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.400]   They said that to one another whenever they met and whatever their circumstances might
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.760]   happen to be.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.320]   They said it with joy and with rejoicing.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.000]   It wasn't just a password.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.440]   It was, incidentally, because these people were often persecuted, as you know.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.360]   It was a dangerous thing to be a Christian in those early centuries, and therefore they
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   did even use it as a password.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.280]   But of course there was a deep significance in it.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.480]   They said it with joy, with rejoicing, with confidence.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   Why?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.800]   Well, because this, after all, was the basis of their whole position.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.000]   They were what they were because Christ is risen.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.120]   If he hadn't risen, there would never have been a Christian church.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.520]   There would never have been a Christian individual.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.800]   So this is the basis and the foundation of all their assurance and all their hope.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.680]   And as I say, they said this to one another, whatever the circumstances might be.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.760]   When things were going well, they said, "Christ is risen."
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.640]   They're going to be still better.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.960]   When things were going badly, when they were persecuted, harassed, driven to dwell in the
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.120]   caves and in the rocks, hunted, whenever they met one another, they said, "Christ is risen,"
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.640]   by which they meant, whatever these enemies may do unto us, the victor, the ultimate victor,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.680]   is on our side, and nothing can finally make him, his purpose, forgo or frustrate him in
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   his endeavors.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.000]   Well, this, then, I say, was the thing which they always said to one another, "Christ is
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   risen."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.240]   It summed up their whole position.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   And I, this morning, really want to bring a question to you.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.520]   Is that our position?
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   Is that the ground of our position this morning?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.440]   Is that the thing by which we live?
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.080]   That's the great question, surely, that this Easter Sunday morning ought to bring to all
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   of us.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.960]   And, let me put it in another way, there is no better test as to whether we have been
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.760]   born again or not than just this very thing.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.480]   To the man who is born again, this is everything.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.680]   "Christ is risen."
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.720]   But if a man is not born again, this is certainly not the center of his life, and the basis
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.760]   of his hope.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.040]   That is why this is such a thorough test.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.200]   It can't be counterfeited.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.880]   We've been seeing that the devil can counterfeit many of the things that we experience as Christians,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.120]   and that's why we're always told to prove the spirits, and to try them, and to test
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.200]   them, to see whether they be of God or not.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.280]   But here is something that cannot be counterfeited.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.240]   The devil is never anxious for people to say, "Christ is risen," because he received his
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.400]   greatest defeat there.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.560]   And this is something that he tries to get men to deny.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.840]   Even men who call themselves Christians, many of them are denying this today.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.920]   They say it isn't true, the literal, physical resurrection.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.760]   But, you see, this was the basis of the hope of the whole of the life of the early Christians,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.240]   and so they greeted one another with a salutation, "Christ is risen."
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.520]   And, my dear friends, here's the vital question that comes to us.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.560]   Is death the basis of our hope, and of our whole position?
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.520]   Now, I want to try to show you that it means two things, two essential things.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   The first is, of course, an acceptance of, and a belief of the facts.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.160]   The fact of the resurrection.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.440]   You've got to start with that.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.000]   But it's not just an idea, it's not just another way of saying spring has come again, and the
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.440]   flowers are blooming and blossoming.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.520]   That's not what's meant.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.080]   This is a statement to the effect that the Son of God who was crucified on the cross
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.920]   on Calvary's Hill had risen from the dead.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.200]   They'd taken down his body and had put it in a grave, they'd rolled a stone over it
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.000]   and put seals on the stone and guarded the stone with soldiers.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.320]   Nevertheless, the stone had been rolled away by angels and he had literally come out in
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   the body.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   That's the statement.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.960]   And this, I say, is the basis of our whole position.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.800]   Now, the world, of course, like Nicodemus, says, "How can these things be?
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.200]   Nobody arises from the dead."
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.560]   And so they've tried to explain it away.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.320]   They say, "He never really died, he only swooned, he only fainted on the cross."
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.400]   Or they say that these disciples stole the body in order to give the impression that
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.640]   he'd risen from the dead.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.840]   You know these theories which they have.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.200]   Some say that it was just the chemical constitution of the earth round about him that led to a
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.860]   very rapid, unusually rapid dissolution of the body.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:34.020]   That is the kind of thing that the world and, alas, many in the Church are saying today,
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.160]   in order to deny the resurrection.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   And why do they deny it?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.400]   Well, because they're trying to understand it.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.040]   Trying to understand the resurrection, the greatest miracle of all, one being raised
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.360]   from the dead.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   But the whole of our Christian faith is miraculous.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.640]   The virgin birth is a miracle.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.840]   All these things are miraculous.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.560]   We are in the realm of the supernatural, as our Lord said here to Nicodemus, "If we have
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.480]   told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   things?"
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.840]   Well, we know a lot.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.640]   And anybody who's foolish enough to try to understand the resurrection, or who doesn't
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.200]   believe it as a historical fact because he can't understand it, and because modern science
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.320]   can't explain it, is just telling us that he is not a Christian.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   He's not born again.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.480]   Any man who relies on his own understanding is proclaiming he's not a Christian.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.520]   The essence of Christianity is that we are given power to believe the impossible, the
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:45.400]   supernatural, the miraculous, the fact, the literal, physical fact of the resurrection
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.880]   of the Lord Jesus Christ in the body, out of the grave, and his manifestation unto his
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   chosen followers.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.000]   Very well, that's the first part of it.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.840]   And that, of course, is an essential part.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.400]   There's nothing if that isn't true.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:07.800]   What I'm more anxious to do this morning with you is this, is to invite you to examine
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.840]   yourselves as I examine myself, and as I have examined myself in the preparation of this,
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:21.360]   as to whether we know something of the consequences of the resurrection in our own personal lives.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.840]   Because it is possible for us to accept the resurrection as a literal historical fact
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.320]   and still know nothing about it experimentally, in experience.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.920]   As I've already said, men may believe the facts intellectually.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.160]   There is something wrong with the men who doesn't do so incidentally.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.640]   The arguments against it are so patently false, they contradict one another.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   The New Testament itself tells us how even at that very time the Jews and others tried
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.080]   to concoct stories to explain it away.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.000]   But it just cannot be explained away.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.800]   And above all, you would never have had a Christian judge who had it not for the resurrection.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.080]   I don't stay with that.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.640]   What I'm much more concerned about is this.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:10.320]   The real test as to whether we are born again is that we know something of the consequences
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.120]   of the resurrection in our personal lives and experiences.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.480]   And this is certainly something that the devil can never counterfeit.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.480]   Never.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.800]   This is something that only belongs to those who, as our Lord says, are born of water and
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:35.040]   born of the Spirit, born from above, have experienced the miracle of the new birth,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   of regeneration.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.600]   Well now then, what are these consequences?
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.400]   They are laid before us in the New Testament in many, many places.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.280]   Indeed, this is one of the leading themes of all the epistles, as you would expect it
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   to be.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.920]   I said, what do we know of the power of the resurrection, the fact of the resurrection,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.760]   as an experimental fact in our own lives?
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.840]   Well, here's the first thing.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.360]   The man who is born again, born of the Spirit, the man on whom God has worked this blessed
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:21.520]   miracle, is a man who knows that he is dead to the world, dead to sin.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.000]   Now what do I mean by that?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.640]   Well, let me first of all give you a number of statements in which this is presented to
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   us.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.520]   Here, listen to this in Galatians 6, 14.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.880]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:46.280]   world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.560]   Crucified unto the world, and the world crucified to me.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.960]   You get the same thing in a very remarkable manner in that passage we read at the beginning
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:02.480]   this morning, after the sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, where the apostle puts
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.480]   it like this, knowing that our old man was crucified with him.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.640]   That's the sixth verse in the sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, a most important
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.600]   statement translated here in the authorised version, knowing this, that our old man is
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   crucified.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.960]   Better would be was crucified.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.320]   It's an aorist, it's in the past, it's happened once and forever.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.040]   When he was crucified, we were crucified.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.800]   So the appeal goes on.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.520]   Likewise reckon you yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.040]   Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.640]   Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.440]   Well, these are some of the great statements, glorious, magnificent statements.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.200]   My dear friends, I'm giving you this morning spiritual entertainment, and I do that by
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.560]   reading verses of scripture.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:01.400]   Listen to this, "If he then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.680]   where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   Why?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:13.200]   Well, listen, "For you are dead, you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   God."
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.320]   Now, these are the statements.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.680]   Take another, "I have been crucified with Christ."
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   That's Paul in Galatians 2.20.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.240]   Now what do these statements mean?
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.040]   Well, these are of the very essence of the Christian faith.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.120]   The Christian is a man who is in Christ, he's joined to him.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.840]   And the result of that is that everything that happened to our Lord has happened to
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.040]   us who are in him.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.680]   "If you have been planted together in the likeness of his death, you shall be also."
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.100]   These are the arguments, you see.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.760]   But we have been planted together in the likeness of his death.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   You are dead.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Now, here's a test.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   What a wonderful test, isn't it?
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:05.220]   I ask you this question, are you dead?
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.260]   Do you know that you are dead?
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   What does it mean?
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.700]   Well, you see, what it means is this.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:23.780]   It means that we are conscious that the men we were by nature, the men as we were born,
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:30.460]   the men that was in Adam, the men that belonged to the world and its way, to the life of sin
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:36.700]   and the dominion of sin and Satan, that is the men we all are by nature.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:43.500]   We are born in sin, we are shapen in iniquity, we are all born as worldlings.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500]   Every one of us.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.220]   We are born belonging to the world.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.220]   Nobody's born a Christian.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.220]   There's no greater fallacy than that.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.940]   It doesn't matter who your parents were, you're not born a Christian.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.140]   You're born a sinner, you're born a worldling, you're born a child of Adam.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:06.140]   You are born belonging to this world and its life and its way.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.660]   Now what the apostle is saying is this, that if you're a Christian, if you've been born
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.260]   again, the you that you were is dead.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.380]   He's no longer there, has gone.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:28.140]   That old man died with Christ upon the cross on Calvary's hill, crucified with him.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.340]   Now Romans 6, 6 and following are not an appeal to us to die with Christ.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.380]   They're telling us that we have done so.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.620]   There is no more tragic misinterpretation of scripture than that.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.180]   There are those who say, "Oh, well, you believe that Christ died for you.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.060]   Now then you must die with him."
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.260]   You can't do that.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.260]   What Romans 6, 6 tells you is that you have died with him.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.660]   You were crucified with him.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.660]   You are dead.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.460]   It doesn't tell you to die.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.820]   You are dead.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.460]   If you're in Christ, you have already died with him.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.420]   The old man is already dead.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.500]   Now let's be clear about this.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.220]   It doesn't mean that the old nature is dead.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:16.260]   It's the old man that was crucified with him.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.820]   There are relics and remnants of the old nature still left in us.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.220]   That's why Paul has to tell us, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body."
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.900]   It's there, but don't let it reign.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.900]   Why?
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.500]   Well, because you are dead.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.700]   You were once one, you are now two, as it were.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   You are the new man.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.900]   You are aware of the old nature in you.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:44.300]   But you know for certain that as a being, you are no longer what you were born as.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.180]   Is this clear to you, my friends?
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.020]   This is what gives a man an assurance that he is a Christian.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.020]   You're imperfect still.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.020]   You sin still.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.020]   You fail.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.500]   There are many things about you that are wrong.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:03.940]   But you know this, that the man you once were is dead.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.860]   You are not that man.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.700]   You're not a perfect man yet in Christ, but you're not that old man.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:17.140]   The old man has died, has gone, has been crucified and buried with Christ.
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.260]   You no longer belong to the world.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.740]   You're no longer under the dominion of sin and Satan.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:31.700]   The apostles again summed it up by saying, "If any men be in Christ, all things are passed
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.980]   away, behold, all things are become new."
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:45.020]   And so you see it comes to this, that taking oneself as one is, one is able to say this,
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.700]   "Well, whatever may be true or not true about me, I know this.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.180]   I am not as I used to be.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.340]   I'm dead to that.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.300]   The world may still attract me, but the world doesn't dominate me any longer.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.380]   I don't belong to it any longer.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.140]   I may be an unworthy Christian in this new kingdom.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.540]   I certainly don't belong to the old kingdom.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.780]   I am dead.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.500]   You are dead.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.660]   You are finished with, as Isaac Watts has put it so well in his hymn, "If dying crimson
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:24.740]   like a rose spreads over his body on the tree, then am I dead to all the globe, and all the
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.140]   globe is dead to me."
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.220]   Let me put it very simply then by putting it like this.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.260]   Do you know that you no longer belong to this world?
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.020]   Have you undergone that death, that essential death?
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.380]   Once and for all, you no longer belong there.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.420]   The man that used to live there is not there.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.900]   He's not there any longer.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.460]   He's here.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.900]   You are dead.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.700]   You have died with Christ.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.860]   Well, now there's the negative.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.620]   There's the first step in the negative, but obviously we don't stop there.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.300]   We go on to the positive.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.980]   The man who is born again is a man therefore who knows that he is alive and risen to a
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.260]   new life with Christ.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.980]   There are these two aspects, and they're very vital, and they're very important, and it's
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.100]   important that we should be aware of both of them.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:24.900]   Now, let me again show you the apostles saying these things and working them out.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:30.340]   Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed,
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.380]   that henceforth we should not serve sin.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.660]   For he that is dead is freed from sin.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.900]   It doesn't mean that the Christian doesn't sin.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.940]   He means he's freed from the demands and the dominion of sin.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   He doesn't belong to the realm of sin.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.020]   That's what he means.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.660]   When a man is dead, you can't prosecute him for debt or for anything else, that kind of
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.860]   relationship.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.300]   He that is dead is freed from sin.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.860]   But then listen now.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.340]   If we be dead with Christ, which is what is true, we believe that we shall also live with
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.380]   him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.420]   Death hath no more dominion over him.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:15.140]   For in that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:20.700]   Likewise reckon ye also yourselves, realize that this is true of you, that's what it means,
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.300]   not just persuade yourself that it, believe now that it is true.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.140]   Reckon yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.900]   Not pretending that there's no sin in you, that's psychology, and this isn't psychology,
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.620]   this is Christian teaching.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:42.060]   It means that you are dead as far as the dominion and the whole territory of sin is concerned.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.300]   Dead indeed unto sin.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:50.420]   You are, realize that you are, and alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.940]   And especially I like the way in which he puts it in the appeal.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.420]   Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   thereof.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.780]   Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but this, but
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.060]   yield yourselves unto God, how?
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:13.580]   Well as those who are alive from the dead.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.620]   And you are members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.820]   Now here it is you see.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.900]   We've got to realize that we are alive from the dead.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.140]   For let the apostle expound himself to us.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.180]   He can do it better than any of us can.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.180]   Listen to him.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.380]   Here he is in Ephesians 2.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:40.740]   He's described how we were, you were the equivalent of we're dead.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.300]   Dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.060]   That means that a man isn't aware of the fact that he's got a soul.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.060]   He's dead to God.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.580]   He's dead to the spiritual realm.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.220]   He comes with his clever scientific knowledge and says how can these things be?
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.220]   Poor fellow.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.220]   He is dead.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.220]   Dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:05.500]   Wherein in time past he walked according to the course of this world, according to the
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:11.060]   prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now dwelleth in the children of disobedience.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:16.940]   A man whom also we all have our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:22.660]   the desires of the flesh and of the mind and whereby nature the children of wrath even
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.660]   as others.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.660]   That's the unregenerate.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.220]   That's the men of the world.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.460]   That's the man who hasn't become a Christian and born again.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.380]   He's dead.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:40.100]   But God, here it is, who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:47.460]   Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ by gracing us in and
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:53.140]   hath raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.140]   Jesus.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.060]   There it is my friends.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.820]   And I put this again to you in the form of a question.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.540]   Is that experimentally true to you?
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.220]   You know you've been quickened?
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.860]   Do you know that you've been raised with Christ from that death of sin?
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:20.460]   That absolute utter deadness to spiritual realities and to God the Father, God the Son
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.740]   and God the Holy Ghost.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.260]   Do you know that you've been made alive?
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.260]   Have you been quickened?
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.860]   Have you been raised?
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.260]   Oh, the apostle was never tired of saying this, you see.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.420]   He keeps on repeating himself.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.340]   Listen to this great prayer he offers for the Ephesians.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.340]   It's in the first chapter.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.300]   He says he's always praying for them and this is what he prays.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.020]   That the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.900]   hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:56.860]   and, listen to this, what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us were to believe
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:02.820]   according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:08.820]   him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:14.020]   principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.940]   world but also in that which is to come.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.780]   Now then the question I'm asking is this.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.860]   Do you know anything of that power?
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.820]   What Paul is saying, I'm praying that you may know of this.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.180]   The exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.180]   What sort of power is it?
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.660]   It's the same power he says according to which he raised up his son from the dead.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.180]   That's the power that is working in you.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.260]   So I put it as an experimental question.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.740]   Are you aware of the working of that resurrection power in you?
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.740]   That's the truth about the man who's born again.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.980]   You see you can accept these things as historical facts but if you don't know any of the power
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.460]   you're lacking in a spiritual life you're not born again.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:03.020]   We are united to him, crucified with him, buried with him, raised with him, given life
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.020]   with him.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.340]   Now here again you see the apostle keeps on saying this thing.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:14.300]   I've already quoted Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 2 to you but listen to Ephesians 3.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.980]   He prays now that they may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.900]   length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.660]   he might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:34.700]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.780]   according to the power that worketh in us.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.780]   That's it.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.860]   Is that power working in you my friend?
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.060]   The power that worketh in us.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.260]   It is the power of the resurrection.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:56.180]   That's the power that is working in everybody who is born of the Spirit, who is born again.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.940]   He doesn't live in the energy and the power of his flesh and his own mind and understanding
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.700]   and all the world can give him to help him along that line.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.700]   No, no.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   He's living a new life.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.020]   He's living by the power of the life of Christ.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.740]   He's living by a resurrection power, the power of God, the power that raised Christ
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.820]   from the dead.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:19.220]   And so the apostle when he comes to express his innermost, dearest heart's desire puts
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:26.780]   it like this, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.820]   That's what he wants to know.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.540]   And the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.500]   means I might attain unto the resurrection out from among the dead.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.180]   The power of his resurrection.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.860]   The apostle knows about it.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:48.700]   He says not as though I had already attained to a full perfect knowledge, either were already
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:54.100]   perfect but I follow after that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.900]   I have been apprehended by Christ Jesus.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.660]   The power of the resurrection.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:06.500]   My dear friends, I asked you just now, do you know that you're dead?
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.060]   I now ask you a second question.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.860]   Do you know you're alive?
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.500]   Do you know that you are alive from the dead?
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.400]   Do you know that in you there is a principle of eternal life?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.540]   Do you know that though you're still in this world you don't belong to it?
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.580]   You've got a different character, quality, type of life in you.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.440]   It's a new life, it's a resurrection life, it is life given by God.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.740]   And do you know something of the working of this almighty power that raised up Christ
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.740]   from the dead?
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.460]   Do you know something of that coursing through your arteries and veins, working in you, thrilling
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.100]   your nerves, energizing you?
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.180]   Well, this was the common experience of the apostle.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:53.380]   Listen to him putting it to the Colossians, whom we preach, he says, Jesus Christ, warning
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.140]   every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:06.260]   Jesus, whereunto I also labour, striving, listen, according to his working, which worketh
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.260]   in me mightily.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.260]   That's it.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.260]   We are not all apostles.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:16.700]   We are not all great men like the apostle Paul, but you know, he was no more a Christian
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.740]   in the fundamental sense than we are.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.160]   He had to be born again.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.220]   He had to die.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.280]   He had to be raised with Christ.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.840]   The same power was working in him.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.620]   It works in us, greater in degree in him perhaps, but the same power.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.900]   And every Christian, every man who is born of the Spirit is a man who has been raised
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.340]   again with Christ, a newness of life.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.340]   And he knows it.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.340]   He is alive unto God.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:46.900]   God is no longer just a philosophic extreme.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.500]   God is not just an absolute or an uncaused cause or any one of these terms that are used
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.500]   by the clever philosophers.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.860]   He is the living God.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.060]   He is his Father.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.060]   He is related to him.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.060]   He belongs to him.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:05.740]   He has been raised and is alive unto God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.940]   It was because they knew they were that the first Christians looked at one another in
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.860]   the prisons or wherever they met in days of persecution and said, "Christ is risen."
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.620]   They whispered it so that the enemy might not hear it.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.620]   "Christ is risen."
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.780]   And the moment the other heard it, a smile came over his face.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.700]   He is indeed, he'd say.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   Christ is risen.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.100]   He's risen in me.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.260]   I know his risings within me.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.500]   I have felt the presence of the power.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.700]   I know I am dead.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.500]   I am alive.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.340]   Very well then, let me add to that.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.740]   Because of this, of course, the third thing that is true of this man is that he knows
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.580]   that he's always safe.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.740]   And he must know this.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:58.140]   He can't know the things I've been reminding you of without knowing that he is safe.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.740]   Listen to these things that the apostle tells us about ourselves this morning in the light
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   of the resurrection.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:11.380]   "But God, who is rich in mercy," this is Ephesians 2, 4 and following again, "But God, who is
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:18.660]   rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins,
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.780]   hath quickened us together with Christ by grace he has saved, and hath raised us up
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:32.100]   together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.260]   Now that's a statement of fact.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:41.220]   True not only of the apostle and the other apostles, but true of these Ephesian Christians
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:47.180]   who had been born and brought up as Gentiles, as you and I have, equally true of them.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.580]   We've not only been raised with Christ, but we've been made to sit together with him in
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.340]   the heavenly places.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.340]   It's a fact.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.340]   It's true now.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.940]   If I am in Christ where he is, I am.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:04.980]   He's seated there, so am I in the Spirit.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:11.900]   I'm still on earth in the body, but in Christ I am seated with him in the heavenly places.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:18.540]   Oh, let me give you what is to me, if anything, a still more beautiful expression of it in
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:36.460]   Colossians 3 again, "For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.460]   Your life.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.460]   Your life.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:44.700]   You are seated here in Westminster Chapel in London this morning in 1966, but my friend,
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:51.380]   if you are born again, if you are a Christian, if you are in Christ, your life is hid with
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.900]   Christ in God.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.320]   Now, this minute.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.780]   You know, Christian people, that's why we ought to be so ashamed of ourselves, that we
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:10.000]   are apologetic and afraid, afraid of science, afraid of philosophy, afraid of the recrudescence
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.860]   of Romanism, afraid, we of whom these things are true.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.180]   Shame on us.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.140]   Your life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:29.380]   It's there because you are born of the Spirit and you are in Christ, and in him you are
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.380]   with God.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:39.500]   Now, here again, you see, is an explanation of why those early Christians saluted one
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.220]   another in that way, by saying, "Christ is risen."
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.220]   That meant we are risen.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   Christ is risen, we are risen.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:55.220]   Christ is at the right hand of God, so are we, seated in the heavenly places.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:02.140]   Our life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.100]   And therefore, my friends, we are safe and we have nothing to fear.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.100]   Why?
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:12.180]   Because he is on the throne, he's on the throne of the universe.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.900]   He sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:21.620]   And you remember his last word, as it were, to his disciples, to all his followers, were
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:27.220]   those words recorded at the end of the 28th chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:35.700]   Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.700]   All power."
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:45.860]   Or, as Paul puts it there in reminding the Ephesians of their position and of this power
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:51.260]   that works in them, God, he says, has raised him from the dead and set him at his own right
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:57.700]   hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.820]   and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.940]   And Christian people are afraid of materialism, afraid of communism.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.340]   They're ready even to go back to Rome to fight communism.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:14.340]   Oh, miserable Christians, when will you realize the truth about yourselves?
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:19.660]   He's far above all these authorities and powers and might and dominion.
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:25.660]   And God hath put all things under his feet and given him to be the head over all things
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:32.180]   in the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all and in all.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.500]   All power is given unto him.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:42.060]   He's already conquered our every enemy.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.180]   Not a single one is left.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.780]   So the apostle Paul again, in reminding the Romans who were passing through a time of
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:55.020]   trial and of tribulation, that they needn't have any sense of fear, still less of despair.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:00.580]   He just challenges them and says, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.100]   It is God the justifier.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.540]   Who is he that condemns?
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.700]   It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again and who is seated at the right
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.540]   hand of God, whoever liveth also to make intercession for us.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.900]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.420]   Who can do so?
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:25.660]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:33.100]   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:44.060]   And then the final asseveration, "I am persuaded," which means I am absolutely certain that neither
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:50.460]   death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:56.820]   come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.780]   of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.780]   Why can't they do it?
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:06.700]   Well because we are in Christ and because our lives are hid with Christ in God and the
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.700]   devil can't get there, still less earthly authorities and powers, nobody can get there.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:19.020]   Nothing can ever separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:27.980]   The final perseverance of the saints, saved and safe, secure and certain because our lives
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.220]   are hid with Christ in God.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.220]   Beloved people, this is the message of this morning of resurrection.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.700]   You have been raised with him, you have been elevated, you are seated in the heavenly places
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.380]   and nothing can ever bring you from there.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:50.180]   That's why these early Christians, looking at one another, said, "Christ is risen."
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:56.140]   And lastly, it follows surely from all this that a man who is born again, a man who is
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:04.300]   born of the Spirit, a man who knows that he's alive and a God and that his life is hid with
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:12.140]   Christ in God, this follows by an inevitable logical necessity.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:19.060]   He is a man who looks forward to the glory of his coming and his appearing and to the
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.420]   glory that awaits him himself.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.700]   Now this I take it is the final proof of the fact that we are truly Christian and born
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.460]   again and born of the Spirit.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.260]   Here again is something that the devil can never counterfeit, will never want to do because
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:42.220]   he knows that that will be the occasion of his finally being cast to eternal destruction.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.260]   He's already defeated, he's already been cast out as the prince of this world, that happened
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.540]   at the crucifixion.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.340]   Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast out, and
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.420]   he was.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:04.220]   But he will finally be cast into the lake of destruction at the blessed appearing of
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.980]   our great Lord and Saviour.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.660]   Now here again is something you see of which the religious man knows nothing at all.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:18.380]   Poor religious man, what a fool he is of all the fools in the world this morning, the man
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.980]   who's only religious is the biggest fool of all.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:28.700]   He has only hope of the Christ as he understands him in this life, and he relies upon his goodness
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:32.100]   and his religions and his performances and he's got nothing.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.340]   He hasn't joy, he hasn't happiness, but above all things else that he lacks is this, he
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.020]   knows nothing about this blessed hope.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.460]   You've never seen a religious man looking forward as the apostle Paul did to death.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.980]   Paul did, Paul said he's in a straight betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.540]   Christ which is far better he says, for your sakes it's better for me to stay here.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:00.500]   As for myself says Paul, I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.980]   better for me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.620]   Now a religious man has never said that, never.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.140]   He holds on tenaciously to all that he has in this world.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.140]   Why?
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.420]   Well because he knows no other.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:20.180]   He doesn't know that he's in Christ, he hasn't the life of God in his soul, he is not aware
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.100]   of his life being hit with Christ in God.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:27.980]   He doesn't know of this mighty power working in him, but the man who's born again does.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.940]   The degree again may vary tremendously, but if a man knows anything about this, well then
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:39.740]   I say he must inevitably know something about this desire to see the full perfection of
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.740]   the glory.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.140]   So the apostle again, you see he puts it like this in writing to the Romans, they were in
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.500]   trouble.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:52.460]   So he reminds them that they're children of God and if children then heirs, heirs of God
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:59.020]   and joint heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.020]   together.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:07.860]   Then listen, for I reckon, again he means I'm sure, I am certain, that the sufferings
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:14.500]   of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.100]   in us.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.340]   For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.980]   of God, for the creature was made subject of vanity, not willingly but by reason of
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:30.180]   inworth subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:36.020]   from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.900]   For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:46.660]   and not only they but we ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:52.460]   we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit, the redemption of
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.020]   our body, that's it.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:43:03.140]   The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.540]   shall be revealed in us.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.140]   Christian people, do you ever think about that glory?
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.780]   Is that the thing that sustains you?
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.700]   Is that the thing that holds you up in moments of trial, disappointment, unhappiness, illness,
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.700]   face to face with death?
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.700]   Is this it?
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.780]   Have you the victory that overcomes the grave, even the last enemy?
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:30.300]   Do you know that you're going to this glory and do you say, defying everything, I have
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.820]   reckoned that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.140]   glory which shall be revealed in us?
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:46.700]   So let Paul add even to that, listen to him, our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:55.260]   worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:59.420]   things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:05.820]   are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.500]   It doesn't matter what happens to us, says Paul, and he's given a terrifying list there
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.420]   in 2 Corinthians 4, of the trials and tribulations he was enduring.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:20.860]   He smiles at them, our light affliction, which is but for a moment, for they all work for
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:25.580]   us and produce in us a far more exceeding, somebody says it should be translated, an
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.900]   exceedingly abundant weight of glory.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:37.420]   While we look, oh, not at the things which are seen, the man who is in Christ doesn't
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:42.740]   spend all his time looking at the things that are seen, they're passing away, they're temporary,
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.580]   but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.740]   the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:56.300]   And Jude ends it all up for us in his benediction, you remember, at the end of his little letter.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:01.900]   There again were people passing through terrible trials, not only persecution, but false teaching
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:07.380]   in the church, and that's a thing that grieves the Christian even more than persecution.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:13.060]   False teachers in the church, men claiming the name of Christ and yet denying the vitals,
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.860]   or adding to it some anti-Christ appearing.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.340]   They were there in the early days, and this is the way he comforts them.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:31.900]   "Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless, faultless,
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:41.180]   before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God, our Savior, be
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:49.060]   glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever."
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:56.700]   And people, if the life of the resurrection is in you, well then it must create within
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:02.020]   you some faint longings and desires after that perfection.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.660]   We are still in the body, and we are waiting for the redemption of the body.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.660]   We are saved, the body isn't yet, but the body is going to be saved.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.300]   It's going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.300]   It's going to be glorified, made perfect.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.100]   There is a glory awaiting us.
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   And if the life of God and of Christ are in our souls, that life will cry out in various
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:33.780]   ways in longing for this great and glorious day that is to come when he will appear.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:40.180]   And when even the whole of creation will be filled with amazement as it looks at the manifestation
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.180]   of the sons of God.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:48.380]   And it will be so wonderful that even nature and creation itself will be transfigured and
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.380]   transformed.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:57.140]   It will be the grand apocalypse, the great regeneration, and all things shall be new.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:02.780]   And all things shall manifest the glory of God.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:09.220]   We shall see him, and we shall be like him, and we shall reign with Christ.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:16.420]   We shall be his people and rejoice in the sunshine of his face forever and forever.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:23.980]   Those, it seems to me, are some of the inevitable consequences of the resurrection.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.220]   How are things with you this morning, my dear friend?
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.220]   The heart knoweth its own bitterness.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.900]   Have you trials, troubles, tribulations?
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.980]   Is everything against you trying to drive you to despair?
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.260]   Friend of God, this is what I say to you.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.260]   Christ is risen!
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.260]   Christ is risen!
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:49.980]   Whatever this world may do to you, it can never rob you of that glory that awaits you,
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:58.020]   for even now your life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.020]   Amen.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:10.940]   The closing hymn is hymn number 147, 147.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:15.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.940]   147.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.940]   148.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:49:07.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:08.940]   149.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:32.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:38.940]   141.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:58.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:49:59.940]   142.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:19.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.940]   143.
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:40.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.940]   144.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:51:01.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.940]   145.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:22.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.940]   146.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:43.940]   Jesus lives, thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:44.940]   147.
