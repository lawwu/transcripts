[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.260]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.520]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 6, reading from verse 10 to 13. "Finally, my brethren,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:26.840]   be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God, that ye may
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.800]   be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.480]   against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.560]   be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand." We come back again to this
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:07.000]   most important statement. And let me preface what we have to say this morning by reminding you as to
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.120]   why this is such an important statement. There can be no doubt at all, it seems to me, that the
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.840]   ultimate cause of most failure in the Christian life, and most unhappiness in the Christian life,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.320]   is the failure to understand the nature of this life. We all start with some kind of romantic,
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.360]   almost novelette conception of the Christian life. And the result is, of course, that sooner or later
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.440]   we are bound to be disappointed. Having started with the impression that, becoming Christian,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.600]   we no longer have any problems at all, that everything has been done and everything's
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.200]   solved. We go along and suddenly find ourselves immersed in and surrounded by problems and
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.160]   difficulties and trials. And so, we become discouraged and perhaps even tempted to doubt
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.920]   as to whether the Christian message was true after all. Now the answer to all that is the teaching of
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.320]   the Bible itself, and especially such a passage as this, which tells us quite plainly and explicitly
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.560]   that we are involved in a fight, a tremendous struggle. Stand? That's the question. Can you
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.880]   stand? Can you withstand? We're in the midst of a great and a mighty battle. Now, we're therefore
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.040]   looking at this, and we are doing so in great detail, and taking our time to do so, for the
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   reason I've just given, that it is the failure to understand this teaching that accounts for
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.600]   so many of the disappointments and the heartaches. Now, we have emphasized, therefore, that it is a
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.240]   conflict, and not only a conflict, but not a conflict against flesh and blood. We are not
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.960]   up against men. We are not up against mankind. We are not up against human nature. We are engaged
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:10.920]   in a tremendous spiritual battle. And we ended our Sunday morning by dealing with the criticisms
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.000]   that are often leveled against this particular teaching. The world regards this, of course,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   as quite ridiculous. The idea that anybody should still believe in the devil and these spiritual
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.080]   forces, the world regards as almost madness. It's sheer insult, they feel, to one's intelligence
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.640]   and understanding. Well, we answered those objections, and showed that ultimately it
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.600]   comes to this, that if you don't believe in these spiritual powers that are set against us,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.820]   it is probably because you don't really believe in the spiritual realm at all. For if you believe
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.600]   in the Holy Spirit, you ought to ask yourself, "Why do I say Holy Spirit?" And there's only one
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.200]   answer. Well, there must be evil spirits, unholy, wicked spirits. So, you see, it's just a question,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.880]   finally, of knowing whether we believe in the spiritual, unseen realm at all. And still more,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.360]   does it come to us as a question as to whether we really believe the Bible and the authority
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.520]   of the scriptures. Are we guided by modern philosophy, or are we guided by this revelation
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.040]   of God? Very well. Let us then go on, having looked in that way and having answered these
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.220]   trivial, foolish, skeptical criticisms of this teaching. Let us go on to look at the teaching
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:45.640]   itself and to consider what it has to tell us in detail. I would remind you again that we are doing
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:53.400]   this morning what is probably the most practical thing that Christian people can ever do. We are
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:02.280]   examining the real cause of the present state of this world. Here it is, and it is the only
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.840]   adequate explanation. So, let me put it like this to you. Let us look for a moment at the nature of
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.560]   these forces that are set against us. That's the first thing we've got to do. Our Lord himself
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.200]   teaches us to do that. You remember in the 14th chapter of Luke's Gospel, he tells a parable of
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   a man who went to battle, to war, without really understanding the strength of the enemy and
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.200]   therefore not having sufficient resources, and how he was discomfited, and how he failed and
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.440]   was conquered. Now, that's utterly foolish, says our Lord, and he's applying that parable to his
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.320]   own followers. So, it comes to us this morning that the first thing we've got to do is to know
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.160]   something of the strength and the power of the enemy that is set against us. One could illustrate
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.360]   this almost endlessly. You see, that was the whole trouble, wasn't it, in the 30s. There was only one
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.760]   lone voice who kept on warning this country of what was happening in Germany. Nobody'd believe
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.400]   it. They didn't want to be bothered by hearing about the rearmament of Germany and so on. "No,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.600]   no, we were having a good time. Let's enjoy ourselves. Life was wonderful." Well, that's
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.160]   how you arrive in a condition in which the whole situation seems not only precarious but almost
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   lost in 1940, because people wouldn't take the trouble to listen to what was happening in the
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.440]   territory of the enemy. Now, this is infinitely more important in the spiritual realm. And a man
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.720]   who doesn't understand the teaching of the apostle here is, well, he's either fast asleep in the arms
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.560]   of the devil, or he is a very defeated Christian. Now, then, look at these forces. Well, take the
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.120]   terms that are used. The first is, of course, the devil. Put on the whole armor of God that he may
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:09.760]   be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. Now, we must start here, because here, according
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:17.600]   to the teachings of the scripture, is the chief of all the powers that are set against us. There
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:26.880]   are many names ascribed to him. Here he is called the devil. He is also called Satan. That's the
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:34.280]   term that is commonly used in the Old Testament. You'll also find it in the New, Satan. But there
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:44.560]   are many other terms ascribed to him. Beelzebul, Belial, the evil one, the wicked one, the strong
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:56.920]   man arm, and so on. Now, these are some of the terms, I say, that are applied to the devil. And,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:04.640]   of course, they're given in order that we may understand something about the devil and his
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:14.520]   nature. And what one, therefore, gathers from the teaching is this, that we must think of the devil
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.960]   in a personal sense. The devil is not just a force, not just a power. You see, the same errors
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.800]   are committed on both sides. There are many people who don't believe in the person of the
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.960]   Holy Spirit. They talk about it. But the Holy Spirit is a person, the third person in the
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.680]   Blessed Holy Trinity. The Holy Spirit is not just a power, not just an influence. And so many of our
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.960]   errors, you see, in the doctrine of the Spirit and of sanctification and so on, they arise from a
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.080]   fundamental failure just to realize that the Spirit is personal. And so, you see, people use
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.440]   illustrations about the Holy Spirit as if almost he were some kind of liquid that can be poured
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:04.960]   from one vessel into another. But the Holy Spirit is a person. So is the devil, he. We have to start
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:16.920]   by realizing, I say, that the devil is a person, has personality, is a distinct and separate entity.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:25.560]   Not only that, we are given to understand very clearly that the devil is a superhuman personality,
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:34.840]   bigger than men, stronger than men, greater than men. And yet, at the same time, it's made very
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   plain and clear that he is not divine. Here is a very important distinction. You see, there was an
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.520]   ancient heresy which taught, more or less, that there were two gods. It was the sort of dualism
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:54.160]   or dualistic teaching. There was the great God, the Creator, but there was another God, this kind
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:00.440]   of demiurge, they called him. And some would even have thought that he was the actual Creator. At
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.960]   any rate, he had great power and control. But they said that he was a god over against God. But that's
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.320]   not the teaching of the Bible. The Bible teaches that the devil is superhuman, but he is not divine.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.880]   He is less than divine. He is a created being. I will come back, I trust, to this again. But I just
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.360]   emphasize that point in passing. Then, of course, the great thing that is emphasized is the point
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:32.760]   that is emphasized here. And that is his power, the power of the devil. You need to put on the
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.360]   full armor of God, says the apostle, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:47.240]   Power. Now listen to the terms that are used in the Scripture to bring out this power. We've
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.440]   already encountered one of them in chapter 2 of this great epistle, in the second verse, where he
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:01.120]   is referred to as the Prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   of disobedience. The Prince of the power of the air. The leader, you see, the Prince, the chiefdom.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:17.120]   But then the apostle uses that expression concerning him in writing, you remember,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.800]   to the Corinthians 2nd epistle, chapter 4, verse 4, where he talks about the God of this world.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:32.360]   If our gospel be hid, he says, it is hid in them that are lost, in whom the God of this world. Now
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.400]   he's not contradicting himself. He's not saying that he is God. What he's saying is, as we shall
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:43.840]   see in detail in a moment, that he is, as it were, the God of this world. This world. He isn't a God,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.800]   but he's the God of this world. But that again gives us some impression of his might and his
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:59.760]   authority and his power. The God of this world. Then take another term. Take the one used by our
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:09.600]   Lord himself, as quoted there in the 11th chapter of St. Luke's Gospel. The strong man armed. Now
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.320]   that's our Lord's own picture. The devil, the one with whom we are confronted, is like a very
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:25.200]   powerful, strong man, fully armed, keepeth his goods at peace. It's all suggestive of this
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:34.240]   tremendous power and authority. You remember that the Apostle Peter describes him in these terms.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:46.100]   Your adversary, the devil, is a roaring lion. The lion is the king of the jungle. He's the
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.400]   mightiest of them all. And there is nothing that gives such an impression of strength and
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:59.960]   force and latent power as a roaring lion. He roars and all creation trembles. Well,
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:08.600]   says Peter, the devil is like that. Then you remember the description given and the term,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.840]   the designation used in the 12th chapter of the book of Revelation. We read it last Sunday morning.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:25.900]   A great red dragon. A dragon is again a picture of might and power. A dragon with seven heads and
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:33.460]   ten horns and seven crowns upon his head. And listen, and his tail drew the third part of the
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:41.420]   stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth. Now these descriptions, and there are others,
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:48.180]   but I just select those, he's called a great dragon. Then another term is that old serpent,
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:55.580]   the devil. The serpent again. All these convey ideas not only of subtlety but of strength and
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:03.500]   of great power. Indeed, it's perfectly clear from the Bible that the power of the devil is second
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:10.300]   only to that of the Godhead. There's no question about that teaching. The devil comes in power.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:21.020]   Next only to the power of the triune God. Very well, if that is the power of the devil,
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:28.060]   what does he do? What is his purpose? And the very words that are used to describe him and
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:35.220]   to designate him answer the question. What's the meaning of the word devil? It is traducer. What
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:42.500]   is the meaning of the word Satan? It is adversary. And these of course are the actual terms that are
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:49.820]   used in the scripture. He is called the accuser of our brethren. That's what he is. That's his
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:57.660]   purpose. That's his object. He is also referred to as your adversary, the devil. He's an adversary
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:05.700]   who is set against us, an opponent, a foe, the leader of an army set against us. He is also
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:15.260]   referred to as the tempter. In other words, he comes and he would tempt us and mislead us and
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:23.020]   delude us. The tempter. But it's all summed up again in a phrase, in a statement that's used in
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:29.500]   the book of Revelation, "And the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.780]   remnant of her seed." And we heard it again in that 13th chapter of the book of Revelation,
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:44.820]   "War against the saints." Now this is the, this is the business. This is the whole purpose of
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:52.180]   the devil. And how vitally important it is that we should realize all this, that we've got an
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:59.700]   adversary, that we've got someone who is always set against us, tempting us, trying to drag us
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   down and to destroy us, someone who's ever ready to accuse us. This is the teaching. But we mustn't
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:14.860]   stop even at that. A great deal is said here about his subtlety, the wiles of the devil. I'm
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.660]   not going to deal with that this morning. I'm keeping that back. It's a subject in and of
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:25.700]   itself. But you remember that he is referred to as a liar, and as the father of lies, and that he
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:34.180]   was a liar from the very beginning. All this is a part of the teaching. But still more significant,
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:41.020]   in the light of what we've got in this twelfth verse in this section, is this. That it is not
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:52.340]   very clearly that the devil, this mighty person, has a kingdom. He has a dynasty. He rules and he
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:58.780]   reigns in a certain realm. Did you notice our Lord himself teaching that in the eleventh chapter of
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.700]   Luke's Gospel, in that portion which we read? He said, "If you say that I'm casting out devils by
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:11.780]   Beelzebub," well then, you are saying that Beelzebub is divided against himself. You are saying that
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:20.020]   Satan, as it were, is fighting against Satan. And he argues that if Satan is thus fighting against
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:28.220]   Satan, that his kingdom must be divided. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:38.140]   kingdom stand? "Because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub." Now, this is the point
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:43.700]   of transition, you see, to what we are told in the twelfth verse. There is the picture of the devil,
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:50.260]   this mighty prince of the power of the air, this king, and he's got a kingdom. He's got servants,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:18:00.140]   emissaries, followers. It's a veritable kingdom. Now, then, let us go on to consider what the
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.380]   Apostle tells us about something about this kingdom. "We wrestle not against flesh and
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:14.860]   blood," he says. Well, what do we wrestle against in addition to the devil? The answer is principalities.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:25.060]   Powers against principalities, against powers. Now, what are these? Well, it's very interesting
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:30.140]   here to notice that the Apostle used exactly the same terms in the twenty-first verse of the first
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:36.780]   chapter of this epistle. Go back to that, have a look at it. "He is anxious that we should realize
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.540]   the exceeding greatness of God's power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:54.780]   in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.460]   that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come." Principalities and powers,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:10.020]   same words exactly as we have here, and yet patently and obviously not referring to the
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:17.820]   same beings. The very context makes it clear in chapter 1, verse 21, that he is referring there
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:25.260]   to heavenly principalities and powers. Some of these mighty agencies that are surrounding the
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:32.100]   throne of God, you'll find them described in the book of Revelation, chapter 4 and 5, the beasts
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:38.580]   and the elders, and all these other myriads, principalities and powers surrounding the throne
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:45.300]   of God, God's agents, emissaries, part of his great eternal kingdom. Well, you see what is being
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:56.180]   emphasized here is this, that as God is surrounded by such powers, so is the devil, so is the devil.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:04.620]   The devil is not alone. He has his agents and his agencies, but these are very different from the
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.980]   ones that are surrounding the throne of God. These, of course, are evil, as we shall see,
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.220]   but the important thing to realize here is this, that you and I as Christian people passing through
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:25.020]   this world of time are being confronted by that, by the devil with all these principalities and
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.860]   powers ready to do his behest, as the angels of God are ready to go on their journeys and
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.780]   to minister unto our well-being, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews reminds us at the
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:40.100]   end of chapter 1, so the devil has his agents that he can send here and there, hither and thither,
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:46.420]   principalities and powers. And, of course, what is again emphasized about them is their great power
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:58.820]   and authority. They have a governmental position, and they have real authority and power in an
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.860]   executive sense. You may say, "Why does he talk about principalities and powers? Why the two
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.820]   words?" Well, that is the distinction between the two. The idea of principality gives the notion
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:16.300]   of inherent power. The power suggests more the expression of that, the manifestation of that,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:24.380]   all that rarely being put into practice or harnessed or something. So you have this mighty
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:32.740]   power which is able to execute the orders of the prince of the power of the air. You see,
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:38.980]   the power—these are the powers, but there's a prince over them, that's the devil. Then we come
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:46.780]   to this next phrase which is so significant. "Against the rulers of the darkness of this
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:53.180]   world"—now, that's the translation here of this authorized version, but a better translation,
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:22:02.700]   I think most people would agree, is this. "Against the world rulers of this darkness"—that's it.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:10.340]   Not so much the rulers of the darkness of this world, but against the world rulers of this
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:19.340]   darkness. Now, look at it like that. Let's break it up. Take the term "world rulers." Here again
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:27.700]   is a term that is designed, of course, to bring out the extent and the scope of the power and of
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:34.340]   the authority. We use this term in a political sense, don't we? There have been certain people
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.100]   in the course of history who have stood out as world rulers. It was the ambition of Hitler to
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:46.820]   be a world ruler, not content with just ruling one country or even one continent. Napoleon,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:54.500]   likewise, world conquest. It was the ambition to become a world ruler, governing the whole world,
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:01.340]   commanding it, controlling it, determining its affairs, and the welfare or ill of its people.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:07.220]   Now, that's exactly the term that is used here. It's one word in the original and a very powerful
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:16.260]   word. Word it is. And it conjures up this whole notion of power to govern and to rule the whole
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:23.380]   world. Now, the word "world" here, of course, has a very special connotation, and it's essential we
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:33.900]   should grasp this. The word here means the world outside or the world not submitting to the
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:40.340]   government of God. We use that expression quite commonly, don't we? We say that a man now is in
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.500]   the church. He was in the world. But of course, a Christian is still in the world, so when you say
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.780]   that a Christian is no longer in the world, you are speaking in a spiritual sense. Now, that's the
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.980]   kind of connotation of the word "world" here. It has this spiritual meaning. It is the world apart
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:02.420]   from God or the world rebellious against God, the world as organized apart from the laws and the
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.300]   government of God. Now then, what the apostle is saying is this, that we are confronted by powers
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:17.540]   that are really governing and controlling that world, the world as it is in opposition against
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:24.740]   God, the world outside God and his blessing. Now, this is surely a most vital matter for us to
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:31.740]   understand and to grasp and to realize at a time like this. You and I, we often say, don't we,
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:38.980]   we are up against what? Well, the world and the flesh and the devil. The world? What's that mean?
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.740]   Well, it doesn't mean the material universe, the mountains and the hills and the rivers,
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.420]   and the sea are not against us. No, no, we can enjoy them and should enjoy them. The people,
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:53.100]   quay people, are not against us. Well, no, but it's the world that's against us. And the world
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:05.300]   means that outlook, that whole organization, that tremendous power of evil in which we are living,
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.780]   as it were, and it's everywhere around and about us. And our business is to be in this world but
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:19.060]   not of it, as we put it, that's it. Now, these powers are the rulers, the governors, the controllers
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:28.180]   of that mind, that outlook, which we call the world. But fortunately for us, the apostle defines
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:36.660]   it still more closely. He says that we are wrestling against the world rulers of this
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:45.660]   darkness. Now, there's the significant term. This world about which he's talking, you see,
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:54.420]   is a place of darkness. Now, here again is the term that is universally implied by the Scriptures
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:01.780]   to define that mind, that outlook, that way of living that is not governed and controlled by
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.860]   God. We've already had it in this epistle. Take, for instance, in chapter 4, we've read this in
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:13.220]   verse 18. This, I say, says, therefore, in verse 17, "And testify in the Lord that you henceforth
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:19.180]   walk not as other Gentiles walk." Well, how do they walk? Well, they walk in the vanity of their
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:28.780]   mind, having the understanding darkened. That's it, darkened. It's in the dark, it's darkened.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.900]   He's also given us the same thing in chapter 5. In verse 8, still more specifically, he says,
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:44.700]   "You were sometimes darkness, but are now light in the Lord." Now, when we were dealing with that,
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.260]   you remember, I emphasized this, that he didn't merely say that they were once in the dark. He
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.660]   says the darkness was in them. They were darkness. It isn't merely that they were in a fog. The fog
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:02.060]   was inside them also. Darkness without and within. Now, that is the state of the world. Now, this is,
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:08.020]   I say, his common description. Look at it again in the epistle to the Colossians, in the first
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.820]   chapter in verse 13. He is thanking God for these Colossians. What does he say about them? Well,
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:24.220]   he says, "This is the truth, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.780]   into the kingdom of his dear Son." Christian people. Do you normally habitually think of
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:36.180]   yourselves as people who've been delivered from the powers of darkness? I wonder how many of us
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.940]   think of it. What's your view of salvation? What happens when you're converted, when you become a
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:47.620]   Christian? "Ah," you say, "my sins are forgiven." I know. Thank God for that. We'd be all undone but
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:56.100]   for that. But do you always add this? Delivered from the powers of darkness. You were once held
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:03.060]   by them. You were once the slave of those powers. And it is vital that we should realize it. So,
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.940]   you see, it's not surprising the Apostle puts it like this and constantly puts it like this,
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:13.060]   because this was a part of his Great Commission. You remember, our Lord met him on the road to
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:20.060]   Damascus and this is what he said to him. "Rise, stand upon thy feet." I'm reading from Acts 26,
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.540]   beginning at verse 16. "I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.460]   witness, both of the things which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.420]   thee, delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send thee." What for?
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:45.780]   "To open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan," which is
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:52.100]   the same thing as being in darkness, you see, "unto God, that they may receive the forgiveness
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:58.060]   of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me." It's the
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:04.020]   same everywhere. Doesn't it strike you as being rather strange, Christian people, that we think
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:10.740]   so little about these things, that this whole aspect of the matter comes so little into our
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.620]   thoughts? It's all because we are too subjective. We start with ourselves and we end with ourselves.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.620]   "I want peace with God. I want my sins forgiven. I want to feel happy. I want a sort of kick in my
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:26.860]   life. I want this. I want that. I want to overcome that temptation." Why don't we realize that our
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:32.820]   salvation is to be thought of always in these terms primarily? Because, you see, you may have
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.900]   this, that and the other, but if you don't realize this, you'll still be in bondage and your Christian
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:45.140]   life will be very poor. This is how it's put in the Scriptures. We have to be brought from the
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:51.260]   power of darkness, from the power of the devil, before we can receive forgiveness of sins. That's
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.940]   the first thing, according to what our Lord told Paul in his commission on the road to Damascus.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:03.500]   Very well. Now then, what does he mean by this darkness? Well, clearly it means primarily
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:11.740]   ignorance, the darkness of ignorance. And that's the whole trouble with the world this morning.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:20.780]   It's utterly ignorant. Look at it in another way. You can say it's blind. What's it ignorant of?
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:27.320]   It's ignorant of God. The vast majority of the people in the world at this moment are not
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:35.540]   thinking about God. Why? Well, because they're ignorant. They know nothing about him. They boast
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.940]   of their learning, their culture, their sophistication. You know, the whole trouble with
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:46.780]   an unbeliever is his appalling ignorance, his darkness. That's why no Christian should ever
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:52.420]   be troubled to the slightest extent by these pontifical pronouncements made by these people,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   these supposed great and brilliant philosophers. They're just blind. They're ignorant. They don't
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.180]   know. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God. They're foolishness unto them.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.660]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.100]   the minds of them that believe not lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ. They
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:18.740]   can't. They're the slaves of the devil. The God of this world hath blinded them. They're in the
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:23.740]   dark. They're enshrouded by darkness, and the darkness is in their very minds. Their minds
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:34.740]   are dark. What a terrible state it is. They know nothing of God, and you know, they know nothing
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:42.100]   of themselves even. They know nothing about the true greatness of man. They know nothing about
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:48.580]   the soul, you see. They don't believe in the soul, not aware of it. That's darkness. They know
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:55.460]   nothing about the most glorious thing about men. And the result is that they don't understand life
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:02.300]   at all. You see, these great thinkers, so-called, are really quite baffled by the present state of
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:08.500]   the world this morning. They can't understand it. Poor old H.G. Wells, having taught for a long
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.220]   lifetime that if only you educated people, they'd never fight again. There he is, trying to write
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:22.580]   his last book about twenty years ago, and you remember his title, Mind at the End of its Terror.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:29.660]   Of course, poor man, he couldn't understand it. See, this century was meant to be the most glorious
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.620]   century of all. Of course, it should have been, if they were right. We were still more educated
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.700]   than we were last century, and that was more than the one before. Knowledge grows from age to age,
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.620]   says Tennyson. Of course, it's all going forward. We must be better. But it's obviously worse,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.180]   and they don't understand. They're completely baffled and bewildered. Why? Well, because
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:53.500]   they're in the dark. We use that expression, don't we? You say the men feel hopelessly in the dark
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:59.900]   about it, and you enlighten them. Well, now, the world, you see, is ignorant about all this. It
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:05.140]   knows nothing about death, likewise. Knows nothing about what lies beyond death. There they are,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:10.260]   lying in their beds this morning, reading the news of the world, and feeling sorry for us. Fancy
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:14.780]   people, they say, doing this in the twentieth century, going to a place of worship and listening
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.180]   to the exposition of the Scripture. They're intelligent, they're emancipated. Men of the
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:26.660]   world, men of knowledge and of learning, reading what I gather you read in such a paper, and in
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:32.220]   other papers similar. But what's the matter? Well, you see, they not only know nothing about
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:39.780]   themselves and about the real meaning of life, they know nothing about death. They don't know
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:47.140]   that it is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment, judgment. They
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.060]   scoff at it, they don't. Of course they do. They scoff at God, they scoff at the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.860]   they've scoffed at all the saints. Why? Well, because they're in the dark, and darkness is
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:04.460]   in them. It's this appalling ignorance. And the world rulers of this darkness are gloating over
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:11.700]   it all and enjoying it as they see these intelligent dupes of theirs, these sophisticated ignoramuses.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:21.140]   The world rulers of this darkness, they keep it going, they're at the back of it all. They're
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.860]   manipulating the press and all these other agencies. Of course, they do it in the way
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.460]   that we shall come to consider later. But the point is that we're emphasizing here that they
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:36.340]   are the world rulers of this darkness. And all that, of course, expresses itself in the kind
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:42.580]   of life that such people live. Well, what is it? Well, again, I say, go to your newspapers and
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:50.380]   you'll see how this darkened mind expresses itself in practice, in conduct, and in behavior. Now he's
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:56.980]   fighting now a legal action to allow filth to be printed. Of course, it's not unnatural. But you
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:05.820]   see, that's regarded as sophistication, culture, great literature. That's how the darkness expresses
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:13.220]   and manifests itself. Now, the question that any intelligent man should ask is, "Now, why is all
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.980]   this? Why do people behave like this? What's the matter with the nations building up these
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.740]   armaments that are capable of destroying the whole world? What's the matter with all this
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.660]   immorality and all the collapse we are seeing all around us?" Any intelligent man ought to ask,
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:35.060]   "Well, now, what causes all this?" But they don't ask that question. If they did, they'd discover
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:41.980]   there's only one answer. There are world rulers who are manipulating all this. It isn't just flesh
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:47.420]   and blood. It isn't just an occasional millionaire who wants to make money out of vice and pornography.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:54.340]   It isn't just certain people who want a baton on the hire of women's bodies. It isn't that men
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:00.660]   just want to grow rich through having places of evil and vice. No, no, they're but the little
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:07.820]   instruments, world rulers of this darkness. We are not up against men, says Paul, not flesh and
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:13.540]   blood, these powers that are behind. But let me hurry on. Well, there it is, you see, and then
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:19.900]   we come to the last term. The last term being this, "Against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:28.260]   places," as it's put here. Again, we must amend this translation. It isn't so much wickedness,
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:38.860]   as wicked spirits. It's spiritual forces of wickedness that the Apostle is talking about,
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:45.740]   not spiritual wickedness. You see, wickedness is abstract, isn't it? And that's the thing we
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.420]   must avoid at all costs. The Apostle's emphasizing that all these are personal. So instead of saying
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:59.380]   "spiritual wickedness," we say "wicked spirits." Perhaps the best translation is this. We are up
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:07.740]   against spiritual wickedness, or spiritual bands of evil, or still better, spiritual cohorts of
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:19.700]   evil—cohorts, battalions, legions. That's the notion. "Here it is," says the Apostle, "there
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:31.820]   are these myriads of spirits of evil, wickedness. Their nature is evil, their very commission is
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:42.940]   evil, and their work is evil. Oh, it's all evil, ugly, foul, wicked. That's what they are," he
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:50.020]   says. "They're all thoroughly evil in their very natures, and in their object and purpose, and in
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.500]   all that they bring to pass." And we've been looking at it. Well, now then, there is his
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.860]   description, but he says that they're in "high places," according to this authorized translation.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.380]   Again, you see, it's interesting. Why did they say "high places" here? Because when they were
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.860]   translating the same word exactly in the third verse of the first chapter of this epistle,
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.940]   they said "in the heavenlies." They said "in the heavenlies" there. They say "in high places" here.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:21.060]   Fair play to the authorized translators. You see, they wanted to give this idea, and they're right,
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:30.500]   that the devil and all his cohorts and his legions, they're not in heaven. They're not
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:36.300]   surrounding the throne of God. No, no. So they hesitated about saying "in the heavenlies." And
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.660]   you and I should be careful as to how we put this. We mustn't think that the devil and these powers
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:46.220]   are in the immediate presence of God, with all the holy angels and emissaries and powers and
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:53.780]   principalities and pertinence. No, no, they're not there. Well, where are they? Well, this has
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.380]   been a matter of great discussion throughout the centuries, and we really can't arrive at a final
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.620]   answer. There have been some who have thought that it means "in the air," when we say we look up into
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:08.780]   the heavens, the sky, the air, the atmosphere immediately above us. That was believed for
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:14.660]   centuries, that these evil powers are between us and God, as it were. They're above us, they're in
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.460]   the atmosphere, and they're looking down upon us and controlling us. But that surely is to
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.980]   materialize it too much. I'm not disputing that there may be something in it. After all, the devil
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:31.820]   is the prince of the power of the air. But again, the whole notion is surely this. The term is used
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:39.260]   to give us a contrast with the earth. We normally speak about heaven and earth, don't we? Heaven and
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:45.860]   earth. In other words, the high places, the heavenly places, the heavenlies, really means
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:52.540]   that these powers which are opposed to us and against us and are making war on us as the saints
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:58.780]   of God, are not on our earthly level. We must get rid of this notion of man, not flesh and blood,
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:07.060]   not on earth. Well, where? Well, in the spiritual realm, in the realm of the heavenlies. It's just
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:13.900]   another way of emphasizing what I said at the beginning, that we must always think of the enemy
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:19.700]   who is fighting against us as one who is not only personal, and all his agents are personal,
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:30.980]   but also one who lives in that realm of the Spirit. And there, says the apostle, is the
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:37.300]   starting point, the point of departure, the thing that you have to realize before you go any further
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:49.700]   at all. We wrestle not against flesh and blood. What then? Oh, against the devil, God of this
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:41:01.860]   world, principalities, against powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against spirits of
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:14.500]   evil, evil spirits, in the spiritual, in the heavenly realm. Thank God that he introduced
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:23.100]   all this by saying, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might." If you go from this
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:28.020]   congregation this morning discouraged, well, you haven't understood it. Are you truly a Christian?
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.940]   I'm saying you've got to realize that this is the enemy, yes, but, you see, he's already told us,
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.820]   "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Take unto you the whole armor of God."
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.740]   This is the glory of the Christian position, that though I am confronted by such an enemy,
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:53.860]   I need not be afraid. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. "Your adversary, the devil,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:59.380]   as a roaring lion, roameth about seeking whom he may devour." What am I to do? Am I hopeless? Do I
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:06.740]   run away and cry? Not at all. "Whom resists dead first in the faith." They overcame him,
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:16.220]   the old dragon himself, by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. Of course.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:21.620]   But don't let that thought make you feel, "I needn't worry about the enemy." "Remember," says
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.220]   Paul, "you've got to stand after every victory." Don't relax, don't go on holiday. There's no
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:33.020]   holiday in the spiritual realm. Stand, watch, pray, be steadfast, hold on. It's all right.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:44.980]   But you've got to stand. And you are offered the armament, the ability to stand, to withstand,
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:52.260]   and, having done all things, to stand. Amen.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:43:02.700]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
