[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.960]   >> Normally I would introduce them but I don't think that Jack
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.140]   or Bill Bernstein needs any introduction and we don't want
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.140]   to steal their time from their conversation.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.120]   So, at this point, we-- well, this is a free-ranging,
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.160]   except non-political exchange.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.500]   >> Why don't we break that one?
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.640]   >> Don't do that to me again, Jack.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.840]   You got me in a lot of trouble with that last time.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.400]   So, anyway, this is called the Lower Side Chat
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.900]   and you guys hang at it.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.980]   >> Well, good morning everyone.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.220]   Jack, I'm going to start by asking you like a question
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.580]   that everyone wants to know, which is what does the retirement--
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.580]   [ Inaudible Remark ]
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.880]   >> Can you hear me?
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.920]   >> Can you hear me?
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920]   [ Inaudible Remark ]
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.940]   >> What does the retirement of Gus mean to those of us
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.580]   who invest in using those portfolios?
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.480]   >> Well, first place, he's been a great guy,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.620]   a fabulous friend, terrific mathematician, certainly one
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.340]   of Vanguard's priceless assets.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.720]   But think about what he's doing.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.760]   He's matching the market.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.020]   And that is not complex beyond belief.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.560]   There are lots of nuances in it.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.860]   But if you follow the performance of, well,
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.980]   let's say, I'm arguing here, S&P 500 index funds,
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.520]   they are all the same when you adjust for expense ratio.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.080]   Their net returns are identical.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.620]   In other words, everybody has picked up how to do this.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.860]   Heck, it may be that Gus taught them all.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.320]   But I wouldn't spend 30 seconds worrying
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500]   about what happens next.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.000]   And, you know, an index fund is an index fund.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500]   And one of the great things about it is
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.640]   that when you buy an index fund, you're really investing
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.400]   for life without worrying about who the manager is.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.120]   I mean, think about this for a minute.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.320]   First, if your life is maybe over a span
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.960]   of, say, 50 years, whatever it may be, some of us
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.160]   may not have quite that many left.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720]   But there we are.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.400]   But over a lifetime, how many managers
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.960]   are going to be there for a lifetime?
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.680]   And the answer is none.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.080]   They're going to come and they're going to go.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.440]   And funds come and go.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.560]   Individual mutual funds come and go.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.200]   Failure rate is about 50% every 10 years.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.440]   Don't worry about that in an index fund.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.320]   Regular funds, managers change every five years.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.760]   So over, say, 25 years, I think I'm about right on the mat
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.400]   there, if you own four mutual funds,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.360]   about 20 managers in 25 years, roughly a manager a year.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.880]   What is the possibility that 20 managers, a manager a year,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.720]   can beat the index?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.560]   It's zero.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.520]   It's very close to zero.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.200]   Maybe it's 100% to 1%.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.280]   So all the index fund has to do is match the index.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.160]   It has become a commodity.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.520]   And for all of Gus's fabulous contributions to Vanguard,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.640]   he was the one to say that he likes to say and I like to say,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   I was the architect and I picked a great builder.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.160]   And that's the truth of the matter.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.760]   But his requirement will not trouble anybody in this room.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.880]   And it's very good to trouble me, except as a friend.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.080]   Yeah, I mean, I should mention that here,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.680]   just to amplify a point that Jack made.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.720]   It was always something that I had wondered about.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.920]   But we all know that over the long run,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.240]   the odds of beating an index fund are 20%,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.920]   which is not horrible.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.840]   But the odds of your putting together
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.480]   a portfolio of active managers that
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.280]   would beat an indexed approach is much smaller than that.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.720]   And Alan Roth finally did that study, an excellent study,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.680]   and demonstrated exactly what Jack said,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   which is that you're the one percent when you're
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.720]   putting together a portfolio of active managers.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.840]   Do you have any comments, Jack, on the swishing away
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.280]   from the MSCI indexes?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   Do you think that has any significance at all?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.280]   No, I think it's a kind of funny thing.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.760]   It was a closely guarded secret.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.320]   We were thinking about doing this at Vanguard.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.520]   And while I have lots of contacts there
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.600]   and touch with a lot of people, a closely guarded secret
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.440]   is something they shouldn't tell me about.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.000]   And they didn't, and they shouldn't.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   And I listened, and the secret comes out in the paper.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.040]   And my first reaction was to yawn.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.080]   The idea that, say, an MSCI 500, if they have one,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   or a Russell 500, or a Vanguard 500,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.960]   or a Dow Jones total stock market, all of them
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.600]   hold a Wilshire 5,000.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.460]   And there are probably half a dozen other indexes
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.640]   at that 500 level or total stock market level.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.760]   And they're all going to have the same return
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.800]   over the long run, no matter which firm is managing them.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.360]   Because large cap stocks are large cap stocks.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.600]   The correlations between managers
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.960]   and index portfolios in that area is going to be 100.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.200]   And later on, I'll show you charts showing--
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.640]   and it's sort of relevant here, but I
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.760]   don't want to get into it until I have the chart.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.180]   But the idea, my idea has always been,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.900]   for everything we do, including active management,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.380]   I used to call it relative predictability.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.020]   I'm going to call it, like I said, relative predictability.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.780]   And now, in this modern age of wants,
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.740]   we want to have my R-squares.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.820]   But there's no change, except you can understand
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.460]   what relative predictability means.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.940]   I mean, I think it's an interesting issue.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.180]   I think it does matter a little bit, maybe,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.100]   of the basis point range.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   I'd rather be indexing an obscure index, large cap
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.140]   index in the S&P 500, just from the view of the new Constitution
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.220]   and the expenses.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.300]   I mean, I'm much happier with the large cap index
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.060]   fund than I am with the index trust 500 fund.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.780]   I want to index that particular area.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.100]   Chuck, let me ask you--
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.700]   Yeah, actually, let me basically agree with you on that.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.040]   I was making this point to talk about total stock market index
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.940]   funds, total international funds,
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.700]   all with very heavy large cap bias.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.940]   There could easily be differences between the S&P--
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.980]   what is it--
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.700]   400 or something down there, whatever the small cap index--
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.820]   600 for the small cap index.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.660]   And the Russell, they have different ways
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.740]   of reconstituting this.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.580]   Or worse, you try to get around a lot of that
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.700]   by using different indexers.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.640]   But as a broad generalization, and when
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.340]   you can save as much as we are saving--
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.740]   I don't know the exact number, but it's significant--
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.540]   these guys get away with murder for calculating.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.380]   I mean, you saw the stock at MSCI.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.340]   Why an index provider is publicly held
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.820]   is another real question.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.900]   But their stock dropped 33% or something the day
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.300]   we made this announcement.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.580]   We saved money.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.940]   They lost money.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.380]   And so hats off to Vanguard for doing what we--
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.300]   eating what we-- what do we say--
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.840]   eating what we preach or something, eating what we cook.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.080]   And so-- but it doesn't--
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.900]   I think you do have to be, I agree with Bill here,
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.240]   to feel more careful, if not a lot more careful,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.600]   in the lower areas.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.080]   But a firm like Vanguard or another big indexer
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.160]   like Fidelity or BlackRock is going
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   to be very much able to do these things in the right way.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.400]   And if they aren't, time will emerge and tell them that,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.720]   and they'll have to change.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.660]   So it's-- I've made--
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.860]   I've never done this before.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.040]   I've made two brands of generalization.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.380]   Well, maybe almost never.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.500]   Almost never.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.980]   That segues, Jack, into another question that I have.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.460]   And this is sort of a personal interest of mine.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.820]   And I apologize for indulging in front of this audience.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.300]   But it's a very interesting issue.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.260]   I mean, Vanguard is a nonprofit.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.120]   And it's a nonprofit which is slowly
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.980]   gaining market share on those companies that supposedly
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.780]   should be benefiting from the invisible hand.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.380]   And it's not the only area in our society
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:36.820]   in which nonprofits outpace for-profit sector.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.740]   I'd much rather be in a hospital, for example,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.740]   that's run by a nonprofit than one that's
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.740]   run by the HCA of Nevada.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.200]   I'd rather-- how many great for-profit universities
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.460]   can you mention?
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.140]   University of Phoenix is the biggest one.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.440]   I don't think it has the best reputation in this country.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.620]   And so there are some areas that hidden hand doesn't
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.420]   do as well as a nonprofit.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.380]   And you've written, of course, about performance
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.720]   of mutual funds depending on their corporate structure
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.980]   and their corporate ownership.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.420]   I'm wondering if you have any reflections on that.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.420]   Well, let's look at it this way.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.400]   The one thing that distinguishes the mutual fund
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.180]   industry from other industries is
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.500]   the relationship between cost and return, dollar for dollar.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.340]   In other words, you would not necessarily--
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.980]   cost determines return.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.140]   But if you get return x and deduct 20 basis points from it
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.780]   or 10, you're going to have a big advantage on someone
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.960]   who provides the exact same performance
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.620]   and charges the exact same kind of fund
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.640]   and charges 100 or 200 basis points.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.620]   There's no way around the math.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.360]   So as long as gross return in the markets
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.900]   or in your fund minus cost equals net return,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.040]   whoever has the lowest cost has the highest return.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.780]   This is not complicated.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.380]   And our industry is just finally trying to catch up with it.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.180]   And they don't know how to.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.980]   And the problem is very simple.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.540]   They are in business to make money for themselves
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.900]   or to make money for the financial conglomerates
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.780]   that own the management companies.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.220]   And for those of you who've read my book with great care,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.260]   if these aren't the numbers that are in the book, forgive me.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.760]   But of the 50 largest mutual fund management companies,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.380]   around 36, I believe, are owned by great big financial
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.460]   conglomerates, unlike Canada right down the line, Deutsche
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.900]   Bank, and so on.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.860]   And those companies have bought mutual fund firms
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.860]   to earn a return on their capital,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.260]   their corporate capital of, say, Deutsche Bank.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.540]   And the interest of the shareholders in that fund
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.540]   is to earn a return on their capital.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.060]   And that's a conflict of interest right there.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.180]   When you're in business to make money for yourself,
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.860]   and the people that you're investing for
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.980]   think you're in business to make money for them.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.540]   And so they have a great difficulty
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.640]   in competing.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.620]   Another six or seven firms in this industry
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.540]   are publicly held.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.460]   There's their own stockholders around.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.420]   And so I think that leaves about six firms that
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.220]   are privately held, six big firms, which, of course,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:20.540]   would be Fidelity, Capital Group, California American
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.260]   Funds, and Dodge and Cox.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.620]   There aren't a lot of them.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.380]   And then Vanguard, which is sort of privately
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.340]   held by its own shareholders, if you want to look at it that way.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.900]   So we have a tremendous advantage,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.980]   because this business not only has cost everything,
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.500]   but cost can be measured with precision.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.780]   I mean, if somebody else's--
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.940]   I don't know-- Lincoln Continental is more valuable
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.060]   than somebody else's Mercedes, Benz, or Jaguar,
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.460]   all that benefit is in the mind, in style.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.940]   Maybe a little bit in construction,
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.460]   but whatever it is.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.620]   Diamonds, they may be a girl's best friend,
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.100]   but it's very hard to measure precise value.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.140]   But in this business, you can do it.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.060]   You can do the math.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.420]   You can see the math.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.980]   You can see just where it comes out.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.060]   You do have to estimate things like turnover costs.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.580]   We always ignore sales commission,
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.620]   which is still a very big part, sales load, a big part of it.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.580]   And Vanguard has, because of our structure and the kind of funds
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.900]   we choose to run, we have a very low portfolio turnover.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.820]   The cost of that is essentially zero.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.500]   We have no sales loads.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.900]   So when you compare our, say, 18, 20 basis point overall fee,
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.300]   sometimes as low as five basis points.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.500]   With others who are, on average in this industry,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.940]   used to call it 100 basis points for a month,
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.140]   just have this huge advantage, but they can't compete.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.420]   The example I use is, if I can just rattle on
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.660]   for one more minute here, is that--
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.420]   so we're up in Fidelico, and there's Ned Johnson.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.980]   And he says, Vanguard is eating our lunch.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.900]   Do something about it.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.360]   Get everybody in the room and say, what are we going to do?
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.060]   Vanguard is eating our lunch.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.920]   I'm a little humorated, aren't I?
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.680]   And so they all come back a week later and say, we got it.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.240]   We can get the expense ratio down
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.440]   by eliminating your profits.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.400]   I'm not sure that's going to make the guy happy.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.520]   Cutting out the marketing budget.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.240]   No more green lines running across your television screen.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.840]   Becoming much more efficient, taking big bonuses away
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.880]   from managers who don't perform.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.400]   And I think if we do all these things--
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   no marketing, no profits, much more efficient
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.440]   on the investment side and on the administrative side,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.880]   negotiate with the custodians, the whole works--
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:55.080]   we can get down to 50 basis points.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.760]   I won't try to emulate Mr. Johnson's accent here.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.400]   He says, 50 basis points?
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.880]   Boy, we'll be 250% higher than Vanguard.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.720]   Why would we do that?
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.560]   So what is his option?
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.120]   He cannot do that.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.640]   He will not do that.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.920]   People don't like to cut their own throats.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.880]   Right.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.280]   So he's going to keep milking that cash cow, which will
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.680]   probably last 20 or 30 years.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.960]   And that is the most, without any measure at all,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.840]   the most intelligent business decision
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.360]   he could possibly make.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.400]   He's doing the right thing from his personal standpoint,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.480]   the standpoint of that firm.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.840]   So if he was doing it as a fiduciary and not a businessman,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.640]   he would do just the opposite.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.200]   And it's a problem Vanguard has.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.840]   If we've gotten such scale now, $2 trillion.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.040]   Oh my god, OMG.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.880]   Is no one can get to our scale.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.840]   So is someone operating exactly the way
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.800]   we do, which is really impossible,
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.680]   because no one's going to be pretty close to 95% index.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.880]   I'll talk about that later.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.040]   So you've got to pay the money manager something.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.240]   But if you just paid him on performance,
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.000]   paid the firm on performance, that
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.600]   would be a good thing for the clients,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.360]   but a bad thing for the manager.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.480]   But you could probably get to, let me say,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.400]   if you get to 40 basis points.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.480]   So what?
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.680]   As a wise man named Abraham Lincoln once said,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.280]   the world will know if you're a longer member.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.480]   Yeah, I mean, it's interesting you brought up
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.800]   Met Johnson to a wonderful, long accent, probably.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.640]   Is that Met Johnson will do what is infidelity's
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.200]   long-term best interest.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.640]   And he may be able to play it out for decades ahead,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.480]   determine his heirs and heiresses.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.920]   But that's still a better-case scenario
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.440]   than what you've also written about,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.880]   which is what happens to publicly-traded companies,
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.440]   where they are managing next quarter's profits, which
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.480]   is a recipe for disaster.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.040]   There's also a moral angle to something I think is worth--
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.880]   you're probably not going to learn more on this.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.560]   People become second-rate teachers and marines
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.040]   and joint diplomatic corps not for the money.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.680]   They do it for moral reasons.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.280]   They think the world will serve a useful purpose.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.120]   And I think that the people at Vanguard
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.240]   go to work in the morning and realize that they are serving
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.880]   a socially useful purpose.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.560]   You saw it in that tradition, of course.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.200]   You saw it as a useful social enterprise.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.040]   And I think you certainly inculcated that corporate
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.200]   culture, just that everybody who works at Vanguard
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.760]   can be working for somewhere else for a lot more money.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.400]   That could be you.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.440]   Say it isn't so.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.560]   You didn't have one helicopter, but you
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.680]   own two helicopters, as I think someone pointed out.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:14.520]   And I think that's the issue, is why are we doing this?
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.440]   And I think the people who work at the big Wall Street
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.360]   firms are in it for the bucks.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.440]   And the people who work at Vanguard
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.160]   are in it because they want to be able to look at themselves
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.400]   in the mirror.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.880]   And I think there's some activities
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.080]   that are socially useful.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.480]   I can provide inexpensive investment products,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.360]   safe investment products, as one of them.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.680]   But making widgets is not.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.080]   I mean, you're not going to get non-profit art companies.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.720]   You need the municipal band to make those.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   Yeah, well, alternatives.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.080]   David Swenson's had a rough five years of it.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.840]   Not bad.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.800]   He's not great.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.440]   Yeah, not bad, just not great.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.520]   Do you think that he--
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.240]   why do you think that has happened?
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.200]   Do you think the ground's just gotten too covered?
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.240]   Do you think that he has a different approach?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.960]   I mean, obviously, he's very ill right now.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.660]   But do you think it's possible to sustain
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.520]   that sort of performance?
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.160]   Well, I never believed he could sustain
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.600]   that kind of performance.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.960]   And I said that to David, who is a great, great human being.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.280]   I mean, he is a straight arrow.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.800]   I mean, there's nobody any better as a human being
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.280]   in the combined money matter.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.160]   He's just a wonderful guy, even though he went to Yale.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.960]   He went to Yale.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.520]   I guess he didn't go there.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.440]   And so I have great respect for him.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.200]   But I said, how can he go on like this in the future?
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.640]   And he said, Jack, you'd be amazed
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.600]   how many stupid investors there are out there.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.960]   And I think there are probably fewer than you expected, Bill.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.440]   Fewer than you expected.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.120]   But there is-- the advantages these university endowments
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.760]   funds have is no conflicts of interest,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.880]   infinite time horizons, no worry about a massive redemptions,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.120]   and no daily reporting, weekly reporting, monthly reporting,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.400]   quarterly reporting.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.200]   God, they haven't even got out their report.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.240]   They're just getting it out now, in October,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.920]   for their fiscal years, which always end on June 30th,
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.200]   academic year.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.600]   And they're just getting it out now.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.520]   And it doesn't look so good for last year.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.880]   I think it's probably going to be about a 0% return.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.000]   College endowment funds and a combined--
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.680]   it's so hard to deal with.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.640]   My poor aging brain has a great deal of trouble
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.920]   going from college fiscal years to calendar years.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.360]   So when I tell you what the return on a bond stock
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.000]   portfolio, I say, well, I can find a balanced index fund.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.880]   It was in the year ended June 30th.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.560]   I frankly had no idea what that 0% compared with.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.360]   Well, it turns out to be about 6%.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.280]   It's the average for a 60/40 index endowment fund last year.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.020]   Roughly that.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.280]   So the colleges aren't going to come up to that.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:07.200]   And the disadvantages, I'm giving you the advantage.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.400]   And they have terrific research guys.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.680]   And they're all over the world.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.960]   They're innovative.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.040]   They understand some of these complex instruments
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.360]   that the rest of us really don't have a fighting chance.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.620]   Speaking only for myself, don't have a fighting chance
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.340]   of understanding.
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.480]   So they're good.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.040]   But what gets in their way now, they've
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.800]   been doing that for quite a few years,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.240]   basically the Swenson model.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240]   They do it at Princeton.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.680]   Princeton is right up there with Yale.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.920]   I kind of wonder why this is so.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   But very similar returns year after year
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.760]   in the last 10 or 15 years.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.000]   I think Yale is about, I don't know, 20 basis points ahead.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.360]   Let me say 12% a year compared to 12.2,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.440]   something like that now.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.200]   And so they're terrific long-term records.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.240]   But what happens in the market is other people copy you.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.160]   And the market gets more efficient.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.600]   There's a lot more price discovery
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.440]   and high-frequency trading.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.920]   There's a lot to do with that, making
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.400]   the markets more efficient.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.520]   And when there's nobody playing your game,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.280]   as it was when A.W. Jones started the first hedge fund
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.920]   in, I think, 1950 or '60, he had a good idea.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.320]   When everybody does it, all hedge fund managers
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.640]   cannot, will not, and are not above average.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.840]   They're all average.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.200]   And then you take that 20%, 2%, 20% of the gains,
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.160]   and 2% you're talking probably 4% or 5% a year.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.600]   Nobody can overcome that in the long run.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.400]   So it's costs are a big negative.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   Efficiency, the relative efficiency of the markets
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.820]   is a big negative.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.480]   People are just getting wise to the fact
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.360]   that these private equity things and hedge funds
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.080]   are great compensation devices for managers.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.120]   And private equity, I won't mention
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.760]   that I have a certain firm whose president is running
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.220]   for president of the United States.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.500]   You better watch it.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.780]   I mean, Nelson Mandela's holstering up his daughter.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.340]   But they rip people off.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.060]   They borrow all this money, over-leverage the thing,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.900]   and they pay it to themselves.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.340]   And it's pretty seamy stuff.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.300]   And I tell everybody to avoid it unless you're
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.900]   sure you can pick the right hedge fund manager, whatever
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.780]   it is.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.420]   So when everybody's looking for, let's say,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.900]   acres of diamonds in their own backyard,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.420]   there's only one diamond there.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.460]   And so the price of it goes up and up
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.020]   as people discover that.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.500]   So it's competition.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.860]   These guys, the general run of people
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.140]   that are running these hedge funds and these quants
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.060]   is brilliant.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.820]   I mean, they are fantastic, some of the smartest people
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.260]   I've ever met in my life.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.460]   And if I was to draw the scale here,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.820]   I would put my intelligence at the baseboard level over there.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.780]   And there it's right at that top ceiling level.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.060]   There's a big gap there.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.100]   But when everybody is doing it, they can't all win.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.980]   This is not complicated.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.060]   And this is not Lake Woba going either.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.340]   There's always so much alpha out there.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.140]   My operating principle is something
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.980]   that's called Raikenthaler's rule, which
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.220]   is named after John Raikenthaler who works at Morningstar.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.980]   Slip of the lip.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.300]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.900]   He wishes, I guess.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.300]   And Raikenthaler's rule for 20 years
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.580]   has been if the bozos know about it, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:46.280]   And I see the bozos now investing in the Yale model.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.860]   We see people coming to us at our firm saying,
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.500]   gosh, we just got shown this by this big investment company
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.900]   or that big investment company.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.980]   And it's the Yale model.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.860]   It's one half stocks and bonds, conventional,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.060]   and one half alternatives.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.060]   And what's alternatives?
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.580]   Well, it's hedge funds and private real estate
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.240]   and--
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.740]   Timber.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.220]   --commodity.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.980]   I love timber.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.100]   I worked for 30 years in a place that
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.340]   produced nothing but timber.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.980]   And what's happening in that area, in rural Oregon,
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.260]   is these old families who've been in the business who
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.220]   certainly don't have to value their cash flow, who
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.700]   sent their sons to work, are now selling out
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.100]   to people in Greenwich, Connecticut,
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.180]   who have smooth hands.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.660]   Where do you think the information asymmetry is there?
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.940]   If you don't know your way around a 50-inch chainsaw
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.060]   and a choker cable, you probably shouldn't
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:52.140]   be working in the forest or investing in forest products.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.860]   And so the Yale model is the conventional wisdom now.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.500]   There's a wonderful section in David Swensen's book
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.660]   where he says if you're invested in the conventional wisdom,
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.300]   you will have your head handed to you.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.220]   Well, he's the conventional wisdom now.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.340]   And I have to believe he's a smart enough man
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.580]   that he's doing something good right now.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.340]   Well, let me put a little icing on that cake
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.740]   by saying, before I love this phrase,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.220]   all new ideas go through these three phases--
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.740]   first, the innovator; second, the imitator; third,
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.460]   the idiot.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.180]   So I warn investors not to be the idiots.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.100]   Another great innovator was John Templeton.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.380]   John Templeton, of course, invested in foreign stocks,
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.700]   particularly Japanese stocks.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.580]   Back in the late '40s, when you couldn't even
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.940]   take good stocks out of the country,
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:49.180]   he was a brilliant, incisive man.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.460]   And when he saw people piling into Japanese stocks starting
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:00.340]   to do so in the late '70s, he sold out to the US market.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.060]   And so the most important word, the title of David Swensen's
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.780]   book, Pioneering Portfolio Management--
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.180]   it's not portfolio management.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.780]   Pioneering is the most important word.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.860]   If you're not a pioneer, and you're not first,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.100]   you're probably in the wrong game.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.900]   And that's something a lot of people don't realize.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.940]   The other thing that I think we all know--
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.820]   I mean, if these guys can't get it right,
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.340]   if all the college endowments--
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.140]   I see Rick Furry sitting down at the back.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.580]   He wrote a marvelous article for Forbes
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.860]   about this very subject.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.980]   If they're not getting it right, what odds
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.700]   does the average client of J.P. Morgan Stanley
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.780]   have who's being put into all these private investments?
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.700]   Not very good, I would suggest.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.700]   The crisis-- we're now four years.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   I remember you talking about the Lehman Index at this conference
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.940]   in September of 2000--
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.100]   I think it was in San Diego.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.740]   And just about when you used the word "Lehman Index,"
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.780]   you just about shrieked the word "Lehman."
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.140]   We now have four years' perspective on this, Jack.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.780]   And we've seen how things have gone down.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.240]   Do you think that we got out of that
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.140]   as well as we could have out of it?
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.300]   And the segue, the follow-up to that question
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.260]   is, if you had been Hank Paulson,
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:28.420]   if you had had this position, in September 16, 2008,
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.060]   knowing what we did now, would you
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.620]   have done things differently than what you would have done?
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.660]   Well, let me say, answering the first part of the question,
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.020]   that when you're confronted with a possible financial catastrophe,
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.980]   which is what we're confronted with,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.140]   that system is so overlinked, so overleveraged,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.620]   so misaligned in terms of its incentive,
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.620]   that we just got totally out of whack.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.140]   And it should have been easy to see.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:02.340]   I, unfortunately, did not see as much of it as I should.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.700]   If I had spent a week on the West Coast
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.980]   with a countrywide mortgage salesman,
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.940]   I would have come back and said, out.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.440]   Because you could see the way those things were building up.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.820]   I don't call it mortgage companies, Washington Mutuals,
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.820]   and so on.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.300]   Never have.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.260]   But I had no idea how much out of hand
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.140]   their lending had gotten.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:32.060]   But it's so, I guess, really obvious
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.180]   that when you've got a bunch of salesmen trying to give you
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.620]   a $250,000 mortgage for a $150,000 house,
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.300]   and you've got $100,000 left over to yourself.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.300]   And that's what happens, or what did happen in some cases.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.700]   And in some cases, the people are making $30,000 a year.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.340]   Some story about a great picker that was making $16,000 a year,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.060]   and he bought a $200,000 house.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.500]   That's got to end badly, right?
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:06.340]   And so then you break the link between borrower and seller.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.060]   And that's what happened in the mortgage business.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.760]   The banks would take those mortgages,
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.820]   make their fees to mortgage banks,
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.980]   sell them to banks who didn't care.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.640]   They probably didn't even look at them,
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.300]   because they were going to sell them
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.860]   to some kind of a new underwriting of mortgage-backed
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.980]   security, securitization.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.300]   So the risk holders were completely two levels
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.620]   removed from the risk-takers and the homeowners
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.460]   back there who have been borrowing the money.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.780]   And that just-- it's only a question of when.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.880]   And maybe I was just not alert enough,
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.180]   and I really feel pretty stupid about it personally,
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.340]   because I didn't think it would amount to that much.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.620]   But if I'd known how much was going on,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.220]   you would've been alarmed immediately,
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.940]   just seeing what happens on the ground.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.540]   And a lot of us are a little more elevated
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.260]   than we should be from the real-world existence.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.580]   And you don't get in the ground.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.900]   I don't nearly enough.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.340]   And that's not my business anyway,
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.100]   but it's such a big thing that somebody shouldn't
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.500]   be looking at it somewhere.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   I think Bill Gross might have been looking at it
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.080]   and had some people doing exactly the same thing.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.060]   See what's actually happening.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.340]   I mean, it's really important.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.580]   Don't take anybody else's word for anything.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.660]   So the crisis was going to come, and it was going to be terrible.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.700]   And I think-- what would I have done if I were Hank Paulson?
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.140]   I think I just would have tried to do a more comprehensive job.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.860]   I thought he was-- I said to somebody,
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.260]   I thought he was a little bit punch-drunk,
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.660]   because there was a punch here, and then a few days later,
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.340]   a punch there, and then another punch.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.980]   And I'm not sure that the greatest
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.660]   credentials for a Treasury Secretary
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.860]   is to be an investment banker.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:52.100]   He's a very good guy, very smart guy, and a very strong guy.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.260]   And without the strength, not much is going to happen.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.540]   So I commend him for all that, but I still
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.620]   think we could have done a better job.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.780]   We finally get the so-called TARP,
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.180]   which was to buy bad assets.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.260]   And TARP never did buy any bad assets.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:07.900]   It was so funny.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.300]   We called it, I think, TARP, which
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.860]   is something blah, blah about getting the bad assets out
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.540]   of the banks, buying them back from them.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.340]   And that hasn't happened.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.140]   What happened was a whole lot of other very different things
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.460]   that TARP money was used for.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.380]   And probably had to be used again.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.300]   I think I would have done more.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.340]   I'm more of a Keynesian than ever.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.900]   And not perfectly, because none of those things
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.020]   work perfectly.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.500]   But I would have done, if I was the king, two or three steps,
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.020]   and say at least two or three trillion steps from a throne.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.300]   Done more stimulation.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.820]   More stimulation in the infrastructure side,
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.420]   where we put people back to work.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.340]   And we may yet have to do that, or try and do it.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.420]   Because the greatest price an economy pays for all of this,
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.340]   ultimately, is the lack of full utilization
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.220]   of its productive power.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.540]   People are out of work.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:08.500]   So I think Ben Bernanke was very good.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.780]   I'm not sure what Hank would have amounted to without him.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.220]   Ben Bernanke aside, Ben Bernanke--
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.380]   actually, he was a Princeton professor.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.020]   He's extremely smart.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.260]   We all are.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.700]   I'm kidding.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.740]   So I think he's doing what he can.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.140]   But he's trying to do the impossible.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.540]   And that is, he's trying to solve this problem
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.220]   with monetary policy, with a money supply.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.140]   Buying securities with QE2, which I always
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.700]   thought was an ocean liner.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.020]   I forget what the other one, the newest one, is called.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.180]   Twist, Operation Twist.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.940]   Getting out of the short-term securities,
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.180]   but that ends with buying long-term securities.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.180]   And monetary policy--
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.940]   I mean, sorry, fiscal policy.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.580]   Monetary policy can only do so much.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.060]   And that's one of the big things behind the blow-up in Europe.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.180]   The idea of monetary policy is, basically,
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.860]   European-wide, because it's based on the market.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.460]   But the idea of fiscal policy is each government's
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.820]   responsibility.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.460]   And you separate those two.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.540]   And we sure have to separate it here,
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.740]   just because of the nature of our system.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.420]   The government's in charge of both, finally.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:27.100]   But the legislative side is just so stymied,
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.420]   unable to do almost anything.
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.420]   I'll give you an example to show you how dumb it's gotten.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.500]   But I hope that's not too political.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:40.020]   But we're trying to have monetary policy carry
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.180]   the burden.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:46.220]   And yet, monetary policy unequivocally cannot do it all.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.020]   So we've got to do some fiscal stuff.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.700]   God alone knows what's going to come out of this so-called
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.940]   fiscal cliff.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   It's not going to go on the way it is, for sure,
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.380]   because the EU just can't be sustained.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.660]   But it is horrifying to me.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.940]   This is not a politically slanted conversation.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.300]   But this deadlock between the parties
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.100]   means no material legislation can get done in Washington, DC.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.540]   And the only thing, the only piece of legislation
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.740]   the two sides have been able to agree on
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.220]   is probably the worst piece of securities legislation ever
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.260]   designed by the amount of demand.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.180]   And that is the so-called Jobs Act.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.340]   Put jobs in it if you want to get it passed.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.400]   And it's supposed to increase jobs
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.500]   by giving small businesses access to public capital.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.100]   So all the constraints on very small companies
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.460]   going public and prospectuses, all that kind of thing,
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.020]   all those are taken down, limited.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.740]   And it's much easier to raise capital out there.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.900]   But there are a lot of swindlers out there.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.500]   And they are going to come and swindle an awful lot of people
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.740]   from going to control it.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.820]   So we get the Jobs Act.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.260]   Both parties think it's wonderful.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.260]   And it's going to have to be repealed one day because it
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.220]   may be, as far as I know, it hasn't created one job.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.620]   But it's just a symbol of something
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.820]   that really lies at the root of many of the problems
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.300]   we're dealing with in this country.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:09.140]   And that is a political system that is in chaos, unable
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.300]   to move.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.220]   And oftentimes, it's a good idea for the Congress to do nothing.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.640]   You could say one of the great blessings is Congress can't
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.140]   act.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.020]   And there is something to that.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.860]   But none under these circumstances.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.500]   So we'll have to see what comes out of the election
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.300]   and see if sides can somehow reason together and produce
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.180]   what's best for the country instead of what's
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.940]   best for their own individual interests.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.100]   I know that's idealistic.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.100]   And I hope it's not too political for Mallory
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.220]   to approach that subject.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.700]   - My favorite economist of all time
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.100]   is Heinlein-Minsky, who wrote about the instability inherent
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.220]   in our financial system.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.420]   And it touches on exactly what Jack was talking about,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.900]   which is that if your primary instrument is monetary policy,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.740]   then what you do is you get into this cycle
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.260]   where you stimulate Wall Street.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.780]   But you don't stimulate Main Street,
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.420]   which is what Ben Bernanke is doing.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.460]   There's been a lot of stimulation of Wall Street.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.860]   Stocks have been on its air.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.900]   All the city assets have been on its air.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.580]   But it hasn't done a great deal.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.960]   It's done something, but not a great deal for the economy.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.660]   If you want to do that, you have to do it
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.020]   on the fiscal side.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.940]   And so you wind up with a--
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.060]   it was more of a map, but you wind up
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.500]   with this very unstable fiscal system, where you just
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.820]   get financial boom and bust.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.540]   And that does-- of all the things that frighten me,
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.860]   that frightens me the most is this chronic instability
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.560]   we have on the financial system.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.020]   We started out with four banks that were too big for bail.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.260]   Now we've got three that are bigger.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.800]   And I think it's a very frightening situation.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.620]   It's why I've always believed from the portfolio side
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.540]   that you want to separate out your risky and riskless assets
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.660]   and stay away from things that are in the middle,
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.980]   like corporate bonds and bond bonds and the most
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.180]   large bids like that, unless you're getting paid
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.260]   to avoid these little risk premiums.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.740]   It's an interesting example of congressional failure,
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.700]   I think, in that we've got the Dodd-Frank Act.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.940]   They've got all these, I think, 194 regulations that
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.380]   were going on down there.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.620]   All of them did what they could have done with one stroke
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.740]   of the pen by saying, bring back Glass-Steagall Act,
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.740]   and we'll run that out.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.180]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.300]   It's about the so-called capitalism of 2005.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.660]   And all we ever say-- I mean, it seems so simple to me.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.780]   You can be in the deposit-taking business,
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.820]   or you can be in the investment-banking business,
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.980]   but you can't be in both.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.540]   We'll call it the mobile law.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.780]   Another question that's important--
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.540]   and I'll offer what we were talking about before--
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.020]   but I think it's important to this group, which
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.460]   is, what do you see as the long-term function
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.420]   of this organization of the nine parties?
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.780]   What would you like to be seen as doing 10, 20 years from now?
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.740]   Well, first of all, I think it's unbelievable how it has emerged.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.980]   And I think it's quite remarkable what wonderful
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.020]   people you guys all are, trying to help others.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.640]   It's good human beings, the backbone of America.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.580]   You forget that in too many places.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.260]   And people are doing all the nation's hard work.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.860]   And we're trying to be intelligent investors
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.500]   in a market that is just the opposite of intelligent.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.420]   So I feel very good about the message.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.160]   It cannot be the wrong message.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.540]   Find another mutual fund manager in America that says,
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.020]   if you do what I tell you, you can't go wrong.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.900]   There's no one who can say that.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.720]   I think Peter Lynch-- he was great in 1992.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.460]   He left Magellan Fund, and it's dropped.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.900]   I'm going to mention this later on, from $105 billion
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.780]   to around $9 billion.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.020]   That's a lot of disappointment for investors.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.100]   Very mediocre.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.260]   Actually, worse than mediocre.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.040]   So to the extent people are looking,
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.660]   people are looking all over the country for unbiased financial
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.940]   advice, investment advice, particularly.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.260]   And you find it in the actual owners.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.060]   There's nothing any better than the owner of a product, car,
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:20.300]   service, say, I've done this, and it works.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.820]   And so I see this thing spreading,
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.360]   like an infectious disease, if you will.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.940]   And pretty soon, everybody's going to be affected with it.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.100]   So I see it getting bigger and bigger.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.860]   And I don't know the logistics of putting together your site.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   I see some of the stuff.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.660]   And Mike Nolan, my assistant, sees some
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.860]   and gives it to me.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.100]   I imagine we have some full-time person at Vanguard
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.820]   who sees it.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.460]   And I believe that the management tries
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.720]   to respond when they see something significant.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.780]   We're full on stage with that kind of thing.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.380]   And I still get letters from shareholders asking
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.460]   me to correct these things.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.800]   I can't do that.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.500]   But I answer them and send them to someone at Vanguard who will,
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.140]   or at least is supposed to.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:14.180]   And so I think it's an idea, an independent body
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:21.660]   of self-educated investors who have learned the right thing
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.820]   in an industry that's going the wrong way.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.620]   So next year, we should hire Madison Square Garden.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.780]   Well, that leads to just one other very fast question
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.300]   to one or two people in the audience.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.540]   Susan is-- I don't know if Alex is around.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.500]   What's happening to website traffic?
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.300]   It's-- I haven't--
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.020]   I haven't ever really done the numbers.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.340]   But, I mean, there's lulls in activity.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.620]   And then I can't answer that overall.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.980]   But I think it's increasing.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.860]   The increase is also in the wiki side.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.580]   Because I think-- but not only from traffic,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.580]   but I'm getting a lot of comments
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:03.180]   here from people who don't have-- aren't forum members.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.700]   And they're saying, thank you.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.180]   So it's not just the web traffic.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.660]   It's the people who are reading the forum and not--
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.940]   I mean, if you look at the stats of the views of the--
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.420]   the views of the topic and how many people post,
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.980]   you might have 10 posts, but 100 views.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.180]   That means I'm helping 100 people,
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.940]   not the 10 who post in there.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.480]   So a lot of the education I try to give
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.180]   is for those people, not just answering the question
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.340]   directly.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.260]   Because what-- did you all hear that answer?
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.340]   Can you repeat that, please?
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:32.860]   OK.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.620]   Basically, what Susan said-- that's Lady Geek--
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.740]   what Susan said was that she's not
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.180]   sure about website traffic.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.940]   A lot of people are lurking, basically, and not posting.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.100]   And then the wiki is also getting a lot of traffic.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.980]   But Jack's comment, I think, is well-taken,
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.260]   which is that maybe the most useful thing we
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.140]   do is the website.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:58.060]   There's a lot of good that goes on on that website.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.500]   It's very high-level, I'm very proud of it.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.980]   And I think we are helping a lot of people.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.100]   And maybe, just maybe in this era,
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.780]   that is really where the action's going to be.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.340]   I don't know.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.940]   I think it's something that's worth looking at.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.740]   Finally, one more question on that.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.740]   Let me just add one little thing to that, if I may.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.300]   I was asked to write the introduction to Fogelhead Guide
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.860]   to Investing.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.940]   And I came up with a quote for him, Alexis de Tocqueville,
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.460]   Democracy in America.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.420]   And he talked about--
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.500]   I have the quote from the book--
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.820]   about the tendency of Americans in the year 1818 or something,
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.860]   a long time ago, the tendency of Americans
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.740]   to gather together to work on issues and to fix them.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.660]   And this is, obviously, if de Tocqueville were around today,
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:52.460]   he would say, man, did I hit that one right out of the park.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.820]   Of course, Robert Putnam has written a counterpoint to that.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.420]   He says that we're not doing as much.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.900]   But this may be the answer to that.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.020]   He's willing to admit that.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.640]   He said, it's an interesting question.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.100]   Robert Putnam's the guy who wrote
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.740]   the book, of course, on the loss of social capital
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.940]   in the United States.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.180]   Finally, one last question, and then I'll get out of your way.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.140]   Jack, I've never been able to convince you to think about--
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.020]   or other people, I have been trying to do it,
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.100]   but now other people--
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.180]   not to lose capital, because it doesn't produce a dividend.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.340]   It's just an asset.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.700]   It's not productive.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.460]   So we can't convince you about that as a standalone asset.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.000]   We can't probably convince you even
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.340]   in terms of portfolio ability.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.180]   What about insurance?
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.900]   OK, we're looking at an environment in which we don't
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.500]   know what is going to be happening to the inflation
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   supply of money, the inflation rate of the money supply,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.980]   and the velocity of money.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.580]   If someone came to you and said, look,
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.100]   I just want to own a few gold coins as insurance.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.060]   I'm going to buy them.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.760]   And I hope they're going to use them.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.700]   I'd say, be my guest.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.980]   We live in a totally uncertain world.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.460]   And if you believe in the likelihood
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.260]   that gold would be a good performing asset
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.580]   in a bad performing world, I wouldn't
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.620]   hesitate to add it to your portfolio as a diversifier.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.420]   Now, 5% probably is not a bad working number to me,
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.700]   in my opinion, and recognizing that it's strictly
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.420]   a supply and demand equation.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.660]   When you buy, you get no return on your money.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.280]   You buy it with the hope you can sell it, if you ever do,
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.480]   for a larger amount of money.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.680]   And you pay for it.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.940]   And so it's just another commodity
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.980]   with this peculiar, almost universal use
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.600]   since the beginning of time.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.440]   And so I wouldn't try and talk anybody out of it.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.600]   I don't have to do it in my personal accounts at all.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.880]   But I would think about it in a long-term account,
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.040]   just because we don't know what's coming along.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.640]   And there is the possibility of, in all ways,
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.500]   the possibility of kind of a black swan event.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.420]   And that would be a helpful diversifier.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.040]   And unfortunately, one of the things, Bill, you know this,
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.020]   is that whenever somebody comes up with a diversifier,
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.780]   someone with a hot performing asset,
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.300]   gold in this case, and says a great diversifier,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.940]   it should be at an all-time high.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.220]   No one called gold a great diversifier 15 years ago.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.620]   Forbes called it a great diversifier, I don't know,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.220]   maybe in 1960.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.940]   And then they forgot about it because it didn't perform well.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.700]   So either it is a great diversifier, or it isn't.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.860]   But there's a huge tendency of our financial markets
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:43.660]   to rely on, or financial promoters, to rely on--
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.700]   they know you want to just kind of secretly watch
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.500]   that price of gold, and it goes up, and you want it.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.180]   So they try and intellectually justify it
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.700]   by saying it's a diversifier.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.020]   So I'd say do gold.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.380]   Do it in very small accounts, and do it all.
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.300]   And with great caution.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.020]   This is a risk-use time, most difficult time to invest,
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:00.980]   I know.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.460]   And not so much the risk, but the terrible returns--
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.180]   I'll talk about this a little bit later--
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.660]   the terrible returns on bonds.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.460]   The customary-- and inevitably, the customary diversifier
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.980]   for an equity portfolio.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.500]   Yeah, you know, there's the famous Eagle song
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.700]   for Rast Resort with a great line in it called,
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.620]   "Someplace Paradise Kissed Goodbye."
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.220]   And I think that's the basic story of all diversifying
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.180]   and asking questions.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.860]   Well, with that, I will thank you, Jack,
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.780]   and get out of your way.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.820]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.180]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:46.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
