[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140]   I don't know if you know this, but some people call you a fascist.
[00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.140]   Yeah, they do.
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.600]   So I figure it's all right to call them a communist.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.820]   Yeah, they call me a lot worse than I call them.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.540]   A lot of people listening to this, myself included, that doesn't think that Kamala is
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.540]   a communist.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.940]   I believe you have to fight fire with fire.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.380]   Politics is a dirty game.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.020]   It is a dirty game.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.020]   It's certainly true.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.100]   How do you win at that game?
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:33.740]   They suffer from massive Trump derangement syndrome, TDS, and I don't know if it's curable
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.360]   from their standpoint.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   I think we'd probably have a better world if everybody in Congress took some mushrooms,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   perhaps.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440]   First of all, medical marijuana has been amazing.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.320]   I've had friends, and I've had others, and doctors telling me that it's been absolutely
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   amazing.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.520]   The list of clients that went to the island has not been made public.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.400]   Yeah, it's very interesting, isn't it?
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.680]   The following is a conversation with Donald Trump on this The Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680]   They're getting smaller and smaller.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680]   They're getting smaller.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.680]   Right?
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.000]   I mean, people do respect you more when you have a big camera for some of these.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   No, it's cool.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.080]   And about 20 guys that you pay a fortune to, right?
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080]   All right.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080]   Okay.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.160]   You said that you love winning, and you have won a lot in life, in real estate, in business,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.040]   in TV, in politics.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.680]   So let me start with a mindset, a psychology question.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.440]   What drives you more, the love of winning or the hate of losing?
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   Maybe equally.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   Maybe both.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.640]   I don't like losing, and I do like winning.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.060]   I've never thought of it as to which is more of a driving force.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.040]   You've been close with a lot of the greats in sport.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.080]   You think about Tiger Woods, Muhammad Ali.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.640]   You have people like Michael Jordan, who I think hate losing more than anybody.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.600]   So what do you learn from those guys?
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.840]   Well, they do have something different.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.240]   The great champions have something very different, like the sports champions.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   And you have champions in other fields, but you see it more readily in sports.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.720]   You see it over a weekend, or you see it during a game.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.680]   And you see that certain people stand out, and they keep standing out.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   But it's there for you.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.960]   It doesn't take a lifetime to find out that somebody was a winner or a loser.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   And so the sports thing is very interesting.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   But I play golf with different people, and there's a different mindset among champions.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.420]   There's really a very different mindset.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.880]   There's a different thought process.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.960]   Talent-wise, sometimes you can't tell the difference in talent, but at the end of a
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.360]   weekend they seem to win.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.600]   And it's very interesting.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.300]   Like as an example, Tiger or Jack Nicklaus, he was a phenomenal winner.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.680]   And he does have a different way about him, and Tiger has a different way about him, and
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   Michael Jordan.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.280]   And there's never one...
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.200]   You would think that there'd be one way.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.760]   Arnold Palmer was the nicest guy you'd ever meet.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.200]   And then you have some champions that aren't really nice, they're just focused on doing
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.640]   their job.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   So you have...
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.120]   There's not one type of person.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.240]   But the one thing I would say that everybody seems to have in common is they're very driven.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.960]   They're driven like beyond.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.480]   They don't seem to give up easily.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.960]   They don't give up.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.000]   They don't give up, but they do seem to be...
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.640]   They have a passion that's maybe more than people that don't do as well.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.440]   You've said that politics is a dirty game in the past.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440]   It is a dirty game.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.240]   That's certainly true.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.040]   So if it is a game, how do you win at that game?
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.840]   Well, you win at that game by getting the word out, and by using sense.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.860]   You have to have a feeling where it's going.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.640]   You also have to have a feeling of what's right.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.520]   You can't necessarily just go what's popular.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.280]   You have to do what's good for a country if you're talking about countries.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.040]   But you have to get the word out.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.800]   And you have to just continuously...
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.080]   Like for instance, you have a great show, you have a great podcast.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.040]   It's very well watched.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.760]   And I'm sitting here and I do this, a lot of people see it.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.440]   And I do other things, and a lot of people see that.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.880]   And I go traditional also.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.820]   You have traditional television, which is getting a little bit older, and maybe less
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.280]   significant, could be less significant, I don't know.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.600]   But it's changing a lot.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.920]   The whole plane of platform is changing a lot.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.440]   It's changed a lot in the last two, three years.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.560]   But from a political standpoint, you have to find out what people are doing, what they're
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.280]   watching and you have to get on.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.120]   I just see that these platforms are starting to dominate.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.520]   They're getting very big numbers.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:19.360]   I did Spaces with Elon and they got numbers like nobody's ever heard before.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.680]   You wouldn't do that on like radio.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.160]   You wouldn't do that, those numbers, no matter how good a show.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.600]   You wouldn't do those numbers on radio.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.640]   You wouldn't do them on television.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.240]   You've been successful in business, you've been successful in politics.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.440]   What do you think is the difference between gaining success between the two different
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   disparate worlds?
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.460]   Yeah, and they're different, very different.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.080]   I have a lot of people that are in business that are successful and they'd like to go
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.880]   over to politics and then you realize they can't speak.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.100]   They choke.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.200]   You know, it's hard to make a speech in front of that.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.080]   Let's say you're talking about a big audience, but I get very big audiences and for many
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.160]   people it's virtually impossible to get up and speak for an hour and a half and have
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.320]   nobody leave.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.200]   It's not an easy thing to do and it's an ability, but I have many people that are very,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:24.440]   very successful in business, would love to do what I did and yet they can't pull the
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.880]   trigger.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.960]   In many cases, I don't think it would work, almost for everybody it's not going to work.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.200]   It's a very tough thing to do, it's a big transition.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.840]   Now if you talked about people in the business and politics going into business, likewise
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.120]   that wouldn't generally work out so well either.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.800]   It's different talents, it's different skills.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.880]   I have somebody who wants to go into politics so bad, but he's got a little problem.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640]   He's got stage fright.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.280]   Now he's a total killer, but if he gets up into a stage in front of people, he doesn't
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.200]   do well, to put it mildly actually.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.240]   I mean, he does badly.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.920]   So you have to be able to make hard decisions like you do in business, but also be able
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.280]   to captivate an audience.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.920]   Look, if you're a politician, you have to be able to speak in front of large crowds.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.360]   There are a lot of people who can't do that.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.160]   I've seen it.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.520]   They can't even think about doing it and they don't.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.120]   There are many people in business right now, I could name them, but I don't want to embarrass
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   anybody.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.960]   They've been talking about running for president for 15 years and they're very big in business,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.960]   they're well known actually, but it takes guts to run.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.640]   Like for president, I can tell you, it takes guts to run.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.600]   It's also a very dangerous profession, if you want to know the truth, but dangerous
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.800]   in a different sense too.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.440]   But it takes a lot of courage to run for president.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.120]   It's not easy, but you have, and you know the same people as I do, there are a lot of
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.960]   people that would like to run for president that are very, very successful in business,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.240]   but they don't have the guts to do it, and they have to give up a lot.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.120]   One of the great things about people from the business world is they're often great
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.920]   deal makers, and you're a great deal maker, and you've talked about the war in Ukraine
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.440]   and that you would be able to find a deal that both Putin and Zelensky would accept.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.920]   What do you think that deal looks like?
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.720]   I think the deal, and I wouldn't talk about it too much because I think I can make a deal
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.080]   if I win as president-elect, I'll have a deal made, guaranteed.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.520]   That's a war that shouldn't have happened.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   It's terrible.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.760]   Look, Biden is the worst president in the history of our country, and she's probably
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   worse than him.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.500]   That's something that should have never happened, but it did happen, and now it's a much tougher
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.280]   deal to make than it would have been before it started.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.200]   Millions of people, I think the number's going to be a lot higher when you see this all at
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.480]   some point iron out.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.400]   I think the numbers are going to be, the death numbers are going to be a lot higher than
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.900]   people think.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.240]   When you take a look at the destruction and the buildings coming down all over the place
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.800]   in Ukraine, I think those numbers are going to be a lot higher.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.000]   They lie about the numbers.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.720]   They try and keep them low.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.760]   They knocked down a building that's two blocks long.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.640]   These are big buildings, and they say one person was mildly injured.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.480]   No, no, a lot of people were killed, and there are people in those buildings, and they have
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   no chance.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.920]   Once they start coming down, there's no chance.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.600]   That's a war that absolutely has to get done, and then you have Israel, and then you have
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.120]   a lot of other places that are talking war.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.820]   The world is a rough place right now, and a lot of it's because of the fact that America
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.560]   has no leadership, and I believe that she'll be probably worse than Biden.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   I watched the interview the other night.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.680]   I mean, it was just a softball interview.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.960]   So you would like to see her do more interviews, challenged more?
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.240]   I can't believe the whole thing is happening.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.280]   We had a man in there that should have never been in there.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.480]   They kept him in a basement.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   They used COVID.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.880]   They cheated, but they used COVID to cheat, and they cheated without COVID, too.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.800]   But you had somebody in there, and now we have a woman that is not ... I mean, she couldn't
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.160]   do an interview.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.880]   This was a really soft interview.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   This is an interview where they're giving her multiple choice questions, multiple guests.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.240]   I call it multiple guests, and I don't think she did well.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.840]   I think she did very poorly.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.680]   How do you think you'll do in the debate coming up?
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.960]   It's in a few days.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.200]   So I've done a lot of debating, only as a politician.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   I never debated.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.360]   My first debate was the Rosie O'Donnell debate, the famous Rosie O'Donnell debate, the answer.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   But I've done well with debates.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.720]   I mean, I became president.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.120]   Then the second time, I got millions more votes than I got the first time.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.180]   I was told if I got 63 million, which is what I got the first time, you would win.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.680]   You can't not win.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:14.040]   I got millions of more votes than that, and lost by a whisker.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.000]   Look what happened to the world with all of the wars and all of the problems.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.400]   Look what happened with inflation, because inflation is just eating up our country, eating
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   it up.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.680]   So it's too bad.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.200]   But there are a lot of things that could happen.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.520]   We have to get those wars settled.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.800]   We have to get ... I'll tell you, you have to get Ukraine done.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.360]   That could end up in a third world war.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.060]   So could the Middle East.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.600]   So could the Middle East.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.920]   So maybe let's talk about what it takes to negotiate with somebody like Putin or Zelensky.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.320]   Do you think Putin would be willing to give up any of the regions they already captured?
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.120]   I don't know.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.280]   I can tell you that all of this would have never happened, and it would have been very
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   easy, because you don't have ... That question wouldn't be asked.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.560]   That's a tougher question.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.800]   Once that starts happening, because he has taken over a lot of territory, now I guess
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.920]   they're insurgents now too, right?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:16.560]   So it's a little bit interesting that that's happening, and that it can happen.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.040]   It's interesting that Putin has allowed that to happen.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.780]   Look, that's one that should have never started.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.640]   We have to get it stopped.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.520]   Ukraine is being demolished.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.760]   They're destroying a great culture that's largely destroyed.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.200]   What do you think works better in those kinds of negotiations?
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.840]   Leverage of, let's say, friendship?
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.480]   The carrot or the stick?
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.200]   Friendship or sort of the threat of using the economic and military power?
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.240]   So it depends on who the person is.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.440]   Everyone's different.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.960]   Negotiation's interesting, because it depends on who the person is.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.940]   And then you have to guess or know through certain knowledge, which is more important,
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.920]   the carrot or the stick.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.400]   With some people it's the stick, and with some people it's the carrot.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:15.200]   I think the stick probably is generally more successful, in that we're talking about war.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.680]   But the kind of destruction that we're witnessing now that nobody's ever seen, it's a terrible
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   thing.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.560]   And we're witnessing it all over, we're witnessing it in all parts of the world.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.680]   And a lot of things are going to get started.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.180]   Look what's going on with China.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.180]   Look at Japan.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.320]   They're starting to rearm now.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.680]   They're starting to rearm, because China's getting, you know, taking over certain islands.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.080]   And there's a lot of danger in the war right now in the world.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.880]   There's a lot of, and there's a great possibility of World War III.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:58.000]   And we better get this thing done fast, because five months with people like her, and him,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   he's checked out.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   He just goes to the beach and thinks he looks good in a bathing suit, which he doesn't.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.320]   He's sort of checked out.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.400]   Hey, look, you know, you can't blame him.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.640]   If that was a coup, they took it over.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.520]   They took over the presidential deal.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.440]   The whole presidential thing was taken over in a coup.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.840]   She had 14 million votes.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.400]   She had no votes, not one.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.020]   And nobody thought it was going to be her.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.320]   Nobody wanted it to be her.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:31.860]   She was a joke until six weeks ago when they said we're going to have to, politically,
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.560]   they felt they had to pick her.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.800]   And if they didn't pick her, they thought there'd be a problem.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.000]   I don't know if that's right or not.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.200]   I actually don't think it's right, but, you know, they thought it was right.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   And now, immediately, the press comes to their aid.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:55.720]   If we can go back to China on negotiation, how do we avoid war with China in the 21st
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   century?
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   Well, there are ways.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.800]   Now, here's the problem.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.960]   If I tell you how, and I'd love to do it, but if I give you a plan, like I have a very
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:13.860]   exacting plan how to stop Ukraine and Russia, and I have a certain idea, maybe not a plan,
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.400]   but an idea for China, because we do, you know, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.600]   They'll be in a lot of trouble, too.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.720]   But we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.120]   But I can't give you those plans, because if I give you those plans, I'm not going to
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   be able to use them.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   They'll be very unsuccessful.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.760]   You know, part of it's surprise, right?
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.800]   But they won't be able to help us much.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.760]   So you have a plan of what to say to Putin when you take office?
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.360]   No, I had a very good relationship with him, and I had a good relationship with Zelensky,
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   too.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.760]   But I had a very good relationship with Putin.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.540]   Tough topic, but important.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.900]   You said lost by a whisker.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.540]   I'm an independent.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:00.580]   I have a lot of friends who are independent, many of whom like your policies, like the
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:07.060]   fact that you're a deal maker, like the fact that you can end wars.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:15.980]   But they are troubled by what happened in the 2020 election and statements about widespread
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.720]   fraud and this kind of stuff, fake election scheme.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.860]   What can you say to those independent voters to help them decide who to vote for?
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.860]   Right.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.860]   I think the fraud was on the other side.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:35.380]   I think the election was a fraud, and many people felt it was that, and they wanted answers.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.260]   And when you can't challenge an election, you have to be able to challenge it.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.060]   Otherwise, it's going to get worse, not better.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.620]   And there are lots of ways to solve this problem.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.420]   Go to paper ballots, and do it the easy way.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.660]   I mean, the paper ballots, and you have voter ID, and you have same-day voting, and you
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.740]   have proof of citizenship, which is very important, because we have people voting that are not
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   citizens.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.620]   They just came in, and they're loading up the payrolls.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.620]   They're loading up everything.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.380]   They're putting students in schools that don't speak a word of English, and they're taking
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.180]   the seats of people that are citizens of our country.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:22.620]   So look, we have the worst border in the history of the world.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.180]   We have coming into our country right now millions and millions of people at levels
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.300]   that nobody's ever seen.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.340]   I don't believe any country's ever seen it.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.380]   And they would use sticks and stones not to make it happen, not to let it happen.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.380]   We don't do anything.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.740]   And we have a person who was the Border Czar, who now said she wasn't really the Border
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.740]   Czar, but she was.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.860]   She was the Border Czar, but she was in charge of the border.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.300]   And we have her, and she's saying very strongly, "Oh, I did such a good job."
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.580]   She was horrible, horrible.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.220]   The harm she's done.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.860]   But we have people coming in from other countries all over the world, not just South America.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.400]   And they're coming in from prisons and jails.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.580]   They're coming in from mental institutions and insane asylums.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.620]   And they're street criminals.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.640]   Right off the street, they take them.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.500]   And they're being given to our country, drug dealers, human traffickers.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   We're destroying our country.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.000]   This is a sin what's been allowed to take place over the last four years.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.260]   We're destroying our country.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.380]   And we'll see how that all works out.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.000]   But it's not even believable.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.940]   And now you see, you saw in Aurora, Colorado, a group of very tough young thugs from Venezuela
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.980]   taking over big areas, including buildings.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.980]   They're taking over buildings.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.900]   They have their big rifles, but they're taking over buildings.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.660]   We're not going to let this happen.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.260]   We're not going to let them destroy our country.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.180]   And you know, in those countries, crime is way down.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.900]   They're taking them out of their prisons, which is good because it's good for them.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.240]   I do the same thing.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.540]   By the way, if I ran one of those countries, any country in the world, I would make sure
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.140]   that America has every one of our prisoners.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.340]   Every one of our criminals would be here.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.540]   I can't believe they're going so slowly, but some aren't.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.020]   But they all are doing it.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.540]   And we can't let that happen.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:27.460]   They're emptying out their prisons and their mental institutions into the United States
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.460]   of America.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.100]   We can't let that happen.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.780]   So a lot of people believe that there was some shady stuff that went on with the election,
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:41.460]   whether it's media bias or big tech, but still the claim of widespread fraud is the thing
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.060]   that bothers people.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.500]   Well, I don't focus on the past.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.500]   I focus on the future.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:53.420]   I mean, I talk about how bad the economy is, how bad inflation is, how bad things like,
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.820]   which is important, Afghanistan was, in my opinion, the most embarrassing thing that's
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.800]   ever happened to our country.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.440]   And because of that, I think Putin went in.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.100]   When he said how stupid we were, Putin went in.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.620]   But it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.860]   I really believe that.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.300]   But, you know, we left 13 dead soldiers.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.540]   Think of it, 13 dead soldiers.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:27.400]   Many soldiers horrifically hurt with arms and legs and everything else gone.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.140]   We left hostages behind.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.220]   We left Americans behind.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:37.300]   We left military equipment, the likes of which nobody's ever left behind before, billions
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.580]   and billions of dollars of equipment.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.580]   They're now selling the equipment.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.980]   They're one of the largest arms dealers in the world.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.100]   And very sad, very sad.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.700]   And you know, we were there for a long time.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.860]   I was going to get out.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.380]   We were getting ready to get out there.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.540]   We got interrupted by the election.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.540]   But we would have been out with dignity and strength.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.140]   We were having very little problem with the Taliban when I was there because they knew
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.900]   it was going to be tough.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.460]   I dealt with Abdul.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.140]   Abdul was the leader.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.180]   And we got along fine.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.180]   He understood.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.100]   But, you know, they were shooting, they were killing a lot of our people before I came
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.100]   down.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.780]   And when I got there, I said, I spoke to him, I said, "You can't do it.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.980]   Don't do it anymore."
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:30.380]   We went 18 months before this happened, this horrible day happened.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.060]   We went 18 months and nobody was shot at or killed.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.060]   What do you think that was, the carrot or the stick in that case in Afghanistan?
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   The stick.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.060]   Definitely the stick.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.980]   The threat of military force.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   That was the stick.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.980]   It doesn't have to be, but that was the stick.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.340]   Well, let me just linger on the election a little bit more.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.700]   For this election, it might be a close one.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.740]   What can we do to avoid the insanity and division of the previous election, whether you win
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.740]   or lose?
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.700]   Well, I hope it's not a close one.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.340]   I mean, you know, I don't know how people can vote for somebody that has destroyed our
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.340]   country.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:11.500]   The division, the bad economy, but to me, in a way, the worst is what they've allowed
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.140]   to happen at our border, where they've allowed millions of people to come in here from places
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.660]   that you don't want to know about.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.220]   And I can't believe that there's going to be a close election.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.900]   You know, we're leading in the polls, but, and it looks close, but I think in the end,
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.380]   it's not going to be a close election.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.140]   What do you think is the right way to solve the immigration crisis?
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.540]   Is mass deportation one of the solutions you would think about?
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.260]   Well, you've got to get the criminals out of here fast, right?
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.180]   You know, the people from mental institutions, you got to get them back into their mental
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.180]   institution.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.380]   No country can afford this, you know, it's just too much money.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.740]   You look at what's happening in New York and Chicago and LA and lots of places, and you
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.140]   take a look at what's happening.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.740]   There's no country can afford this, we can't afford it.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.820]   And we've got to get the bad ones out immediately, and the rest have to be worked on.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.380]   You know, it's happened before, Dwight Eisenhower was sort of a moderate president, moderate
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.700]   type person, but he hated when he saw people pouring into the country, and they were.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.700]   Nothing like now.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.220]   You know, I probably got elected in 2016 because of the border.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.940]   And I told people what was happening, and they understood it.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.180]   And I won the election, and I won the election, I think, because of the border.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:35.420]   Our border is 25 times worse right now than it was in 2016.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.620]   I had it fixed, too.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:42.860]   I had it, the last week of my, the famous chart that I put up was exactly that.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.860]   You know the chart?
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.500]   When I looked to the right, I said, "There's the chart, bing."
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.700]   That was not a pleasant experience.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.340]   But the chart that I put up said, and that was done by Border Patrol, that was the lowest
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.140]   number that we've ever had come into our country in recorded history.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.820]   And we have to get it back to that again.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   We will.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.900]   Let me ask you about Project 2025.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.580]   So you've publicly said that you don't have any direct connection to Project 2025.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.580]   Nothing.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.580]   I know nothing about it.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.420]   And they know that, too.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   Democrats know that.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.740]   And I purposely haven't read it, because I want to say to you, I don't, I have no idea
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.820]   what it's all about.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   It's easier than saying, "I read it," and you know, all of the things.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.940]   So, I purposely haven't read it.
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:32.740]   And I've heard about it, I've heard about things that are in there that I don't like.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.680]   And there's some things in there that everybody would like.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.300]   But there are things that I don't like at all.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.820]   And I think it's unfortunate that they put it out.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.980]   But it doesn't mean anything, because it has nothing to do with me.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:53.100]   Project 2025 has, it has absolutely nothing to do with me.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:00.740]   You posted recently about marijuana, and that you're okay with it being legalized, but it
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.740]   has to be done safely.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.380]   Can you explain your policy there?
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.980]   Well, I just put out a paper.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.940]   And first of all, medical marijuana has been amazing.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.380]   It's been, I've had friends, and I've had others, and doctors telling me that it's been
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.860]   absolutely amazing, the medical marijuana.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:27.500]   And we put out a statement that we can live with the marijuana.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.500]   It's got to be a certain age, got to be a certain age to buy it.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:37.140]   It's got to be done in a very concerted, lawful way.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.260]   And the way they're doing it in Florida, I think, is going to be actually good.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.140]   It's going to be very good.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.700]   But it's got to be done in a good way.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.660]   It's got to be done in a clean way.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.700]   You go into some of these places, like in New York, it's all, it smells all marijuana.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:55.780]   You can't, the way, you've got to have a system where there's control.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.940]   And I think the way they've done it in Florida is very good.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.460]   Do you know anything about psychedelics?
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:08.100]   So I'm not a drug guy, but I recently did ayahuasca, and there's a lot of people that
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:16.420]   speak to sort of the health benefits and the spiritual benefits of these different psychedelics.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.900]   I think we would probably have a better world if everybody in Congress took some mushrooms,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.900]   perhaps.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:28.020]   Now, I know you don't, you stay away from all of that stuff.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   I know also veterans use it for dealing with PTSD and all that kind of stuff.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:37.660]   So it's great, and it's interesting that you're thinking about being more accepting of some
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:44.580]   of these drugs, which don't just have a recreational purpose, but a medical purpose, a treatment
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.580]   purpose.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.580]   We put out a statement today.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:51.100]   We're going to put out another one probably next week, be more specific, although I think
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.440]   it's pretty specific.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.660]   And we'll see how that all goes.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:02.420]   That's a referendum coming up in some states, but it's coming up, and we'll see how it does.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.820]   I will say it's been very hard to beat it.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.860]   You take a look at the numbers, it's been very hard to beat it.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.620]   So I think it'll generally pass, but you want to do it in a safe way.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.820]   Speaking of marijuana, let me ask you about my good friend, Joe Rogan, because you had
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.820]   a bit of tension with him.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:26.060]   So when he said nice things about RFK Jr., I think, you've said some not so nice things
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.860]   about Joe, and I think that was a bit unfair.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:37.860]   And as a fan of Joe, I would love to see you do his podcast, because he is legit the greatest
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.620]   conversationalist in the world.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.540]   So what's the story behind the tension?
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:49.860]   I don't think there was any tension, and I've always liked him, but I don't know him.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:55.060]   I only see him when I walk into the arena with Dana, and I shake his hand.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:00.700]   I see him there, and I think he's good at what he does, but I don't know about doing
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.700]   his podcast.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:08.220]   I mean, I guess I'd do it, but I haven't been asked, and I'm not asking them.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.620]   I'm not asking anybody.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.780]   It sounds like a challenging negotiation situation.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.780]   No, it's not.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:19.460]   It's not really a negotiation, and he's sort of a liberal guy, I guess, from what I understand,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.620]   but he likes Kennedy.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.940]   This was before I found this out, before Kennedy came in with us.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.940]   He's going to be great.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.940]   He's doing...
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.220]   Bobby's going to be great, but I like that he likes Kennedy.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.220]   I do too.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:36.940]   He's a different kind of a guy, but he's got some great things going, and I think he's
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.220]   going to be beyond politics.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.540]   I think he could be quite influential in taking care of some situations that you probably
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.860]   would agree should be taken care of.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.500]   The Joe Rogan post is an example.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:54.740]   I'd love to get your psychology about behind the tweets and the posts on truth.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:59.980]   Are you sometimes being intentionally provocative, or are you just speaking your mind, and are
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.900]   there times where you regret some of the truths you've posted?
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.500]   Yeah, I do, but not that often, honestly.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.180]   I do a lot of reposting.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.780]   The ones you get in trouble with are the reposts, because you find down deep, they're into some
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.700]   group that you're not supposed to be reposting.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.620]   You don't even know if those groups are good, bad, or indifferent, but the reposts are the
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.620]   ones that really get you in trouble.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:31.100]   When you do your own words, it's sort of easier, but the reposts go very quickly, and if you're
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:38.860]   going to check every single little symbol, and I don't know, it's worked out pretty well
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.540]   for me, I tell you.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.700]   Truth is very powerful, truth.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.580]   It's my platform, and it's been very powerful, very, very powerful.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.580]   Goes everywhere.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.140]   I call it my typewriter.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.140]   That's actually my typewriter.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.700]   What are you doing usually when you're composing a truth?
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.740]   Are you chilling back on a couch?
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   Sometimes beds.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.740]   Okay.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.740]   A lot of different things.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.020]   Like late at night, and just-
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.940]   I'd like to do something late at night.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:16.580]   I'm not a huge sleeper, but whenever I do them past three o'clock, they criticize you
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.580]   the next day.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.820]   Trump was up, truth thing.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.060]   Trump was truth thing at three o'clock in the morning, and there should be no problem
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.060]   with that.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.260]   Then when you think about time zones, how do they know that you're in a time zone, like
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.340]   an eastern zone?
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:44.140]   Every time I do it after two or three o'clock, it's like, "Why is he doing that?"
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:51.140]   Truth has become a very successful platform, and I like doing it.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.140]   It goes everywhere.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.460]   As soon as I do it, it goes everywhere.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.420]   The country seems more divided than ever.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.700]   What can you do to help alleviate some of that division?
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.460]   You can get rid of these two people.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.460]   They're terrible.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.820]   They're terrible.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.700]   You don't want to have them running this country.
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.700]   They're not equipped to run it.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:17.260]   Joe just ... Joe is a disaster, and Kamala, I think she'll end up being worse than him.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.260]   We'll see.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:23.140]   I think a lot's now ... The convention's over with, and I see I'm leading in just about
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.980]   all the polls now.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.380]   They had their little honeymoon period, as they call it.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.820]   We'll see how that all goes.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.820]   Who knows?
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:37.580]   From my personal opinion, I think you are at your best when you're talking about a positive
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.420]   vision of the future versus criticizing the other side.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.420]   I think you have to criticize, though.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.900]   I think they're nasty.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:53.420]   They came up with a story that I looked down and I called soldiers that died in World War
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.300]   I, suckers and losers, okay.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.940]   Now, number one, who would say that?
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.860]   Number two, who would say it to military people?
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:01.860]   Nobody.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.860]   It was a made up story.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.940]   It was just a made up story.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.420]   They like to repeat it over again.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.940]   They know it was made up.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:13.980]   I have 26 witnesses that nothing was said.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.640]   They don't want to hear about that.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.020]   Like she lied on McDonald's.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.500]   She said that she worked at McDonald's.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.380]   It's not a big lie, but it's a big lie.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.020]   They just went and they checked.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.180]   Unless she can show something, they don't talk about, the press isn't going to follow
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.460]   up with it, but I'll keep hammering it.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.540]   She never worked at McDonald's.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:42.180]   It was just a cool thing to say, "Hey, I worked at McDonald's."
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:47.660]   One of the worst was two days ago, I went to Arlington at the request of people that
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.620]   lost their children.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.260]   There'll always be children to those people.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   You understand that.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.900]   That's not a politically incorrect thing to say.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.620]   The mother comes up, "I lost my child."
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.140]   But the child is a soldier.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.580]   Lost a child because of Biden and because of Kamala.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.620]   Just as though they had the gun in their hand because it was so badly handled.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.060]   It should have been done at Bagram, which is the big airbase.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:21.100]   It shouldn't have been done at a small little airport right in the middle of town where
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.980]   people stormed it.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.420]   It was a true disaster.
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:35.460]   They asked me if I'd come and celebrate with them three years, three years, they died three
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   years ago.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.460]   I said, "I'm going to try."
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.500]   I got to know them because I brought them here, actually.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:48.300]   One night, they almost all came here and they said, "I wonder if Trump will actually come
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.300]   and see us."
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   I heard they were here.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:57.020]   And we stayed for like four hours listening to music up on a deck right upstairs, beautiful.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.180]   And they were great people.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.380]   So they called me over the last couple of weeks and they said, "We're going to have
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.300]   a reunion, a three-year reunion.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.500]   Would you be able to come?"
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.340]   It was very hard for me to do it logistically, but I said, "I'll get it done."
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.060]   And I got there and we had a beautiful time.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   I didn't run away.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.700]   I didn't just walk in, shake hands, and walk out like people do.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.180]   And I wasn't looking at my watch like Joe Biden does.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.340]   And it was amazing.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.460]   So I did it for them.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.420]   I didn't do it for me.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.420]   I don't need the publicity.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.460]   I mean, I get more publicity probably than anybody.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.300]   You would know that better than me, but I think maybe more than anybody.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.700]   Maybe more than anybody that's ever lived.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.660]   I don't know, but I don't think anyone could have any more.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.140]   Every time you turn on television, there's like nine different stories all on different
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.160]   topics in the world about Trump.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.180]   As an example, you interview a lot of people, good people, successful people.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.660]   Let's see how you do with this interview versus them, okay?
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.480]   I can tell you right now, you're going to get the highest numbers you've ever had by
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:16.460]   sometimes a factor of 10, but when a gold star family asks me to come in and spend time
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:22.320]   with them, and then they said, "Sir," we did a ceremony and then we went down to the graves,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:29.280]   which was quite a distance away, they said, "Sir, would you come to the grave?"
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.100]   And then they said when we were there, it's very sad actually, because these people shouldn't
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   have died.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100]   They shouldn't have died.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.720]   They died because of Biden and because of Kamala.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   They died because it's just like if they pulled the trigger, okay?
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.040]   Now, I don't know if that's controversial to say, but I don't think it is.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.400]   Afghanistan was the most incompetently run operation I think I've ever seen, military
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.160]   or otherwise, they were incompetent.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.280]   But the families asked me if I'd go.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.460]   I did go.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.800]   Then the family said, "Could we have a picture at the tombstone of my son?"
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   And we did.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.160]   Son or daughter, there was a daughter too.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.280]   And I took numerous pictures with the families.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.520]   I don't know of anybody else that was in the pictures, but they were mostly families, I
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   guess.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   That was it.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   And then I left.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   I spent a lot of time with them.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:25.640]   Then I left and I get home that night and I get a call that the Biden administration
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:31.920]   with Kamala is accusing me of using Arlington for publicity.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.520]   I was in news, just the opposite, just the opposite.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.960]   And actually, did you see, it just came out, the families actually put out a very strong
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.520]   statement defending me.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.960]   They said, "We asked him to be there."
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.000]   Well, politicians and the media can play those games, and you're right.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.600]   Your name gets a lot of use.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:56.000]   You're probably legit the most famous person in the world.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.160]   But on the previous thing, in the spirit of unity, you used to be a Democrat.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:08.800]   Setting the politicians aside, what do you respect most about people who lean left, who
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:14.200]   are Democrats themselves, or of that persuasion, progressives, liberals, and so on?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.600]   Well, look, I respect the fact that everybody's in there.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.320]   And to a certain extent, life is what you do while you're waiting to die, so you might
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.240]   as well do a good job.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.520]   I think in terms of what's happening now, I think we have a chance to save the country.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.880]   This country's going down.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.200]   And I called it with Venezuela.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.040]   I called it with a lot of different countries.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.920]   And this country's going down.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:50.000]   If we don't win this election, the election coming up on November 5th is the most important
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.080]   election this country's ever had, because if we don't win it, I don't know that there'll
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.560]   be another election, and it's going to be a communist country, or close.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:07.160]   And there's a lot of people listening to this, myself included, that doesn't think that Kamala
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.800]   is a communist.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.520]   Well, she's a Marxist.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   Her father's a Marxist.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   That's right.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   And she's advocating-
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   It's a little unusual.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.600]   She's advocating for some policies that are towards the direction of democratic socialism,
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   let's say.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.560]   But there's a lot of people that kind of know the way government works, and they say, "Well,
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.680]   none of those policies are going to actually come to reality.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.160]   It's just being used during the campaign to, groceries are too expensive.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   We need them cheaper.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.840]   Let's talk about price controls," and that's never going to come to reality.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   It could come to reality.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.400]   Look, I mean, she came out with price control.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.520]   It's been tried like 121 different times at different places over the years, and it's
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.880]   never worked once.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   It leads to communism.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   It leads to socialism.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:39:00.520]   It leads to having no food on the shelves, and it leads to tremendous inflation.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   It's just-
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.600]   It's a bad idea.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.320]   I remember we used terms like communism for her, and I don't know if you know this, but
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.360]   some people call you a fascist.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   Yeah, they do.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.160]   So, I figure it's all right to call them a communist, yeah.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.200]   They call me a lot worse than I call them.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   They do indeed.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.360]   It's just sometimes-
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   It's interesting, though.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.720]   They'll call me something that's terrible, and then I'll hit them back.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.600]   And they'll say, "Isn't it terrible what Trump said?"
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.360]   I said, "Wait a minute, they just called me ..." So, I believe you have to fight fire with
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   fire.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.440]   I believe they're very evil people.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.240]   These are evil people.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:37.480]   We have an enemy from the outside, and we have an enemy from within.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.720]   And in my opinion, the enemy from within are radical left lunatics, and I think you have
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.280]   to fight back.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.240]   Whenever there's a lot of fighting fire with fire, it's too easy to forget that there's
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:40:00.360]   a middle of America that's moderate and kind of sees the good in both sides, and just likes
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.720]   one side more than the other in terms of policies.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.600]   Like I said, there's a lot of people that like your policies, like your skill in being
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:15.120]   able to negotiate and end wars, and they don't see the impending destruction of America.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.920]   We had no wars when I was president.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   That's a big thing.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.360]   Not since 78 years has that happened, but we had no wars when I was president.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.840]   We defeated ISIS, but that was a war that was started that we weren't anywhere near
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.280]   defeating.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:35.680]   But think of it, I had no wars, and Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, said
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.320]   the world has to have Trump back because everybody was afraid of Trump.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.000]   Now, that's what he said, so I'm not using that term, but I think they respected me.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.960]   But he said China was afraid, Russia was afraid, everybody was afraid.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.520]   And I don't care what word they use.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.780]   Probably that's even a better word, if you want to know the truth, but let's use the
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.780]   word respect.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.240]   If they had respect for me, they had respect for the country.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:05.160]   I mean, I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the Russian pipeline.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.160]   Nobody else could have done that.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   I ended it.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   It was done.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.200]   Then Biden comes in and he gave it, he approved it.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.760]   So we're defending Germany and these other countries for peanuts compared to what it's
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:22.360]   worth, and they're paying the person we're defending them against billions and billions
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.240]   of dollars for energy.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.560]   I said, "How does that work?"
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.680]   And we had it out with them and it worked out good, and they paid hundreds of billions
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   of dollars.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.260]   Or you wouldn't even have a NATO right now.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.280]   You wouldn't have NATO if it wasn't for me.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:41.180]   As the leader of the United States, you were the most powerful man in the world.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.360]   As you mentioned, not only the most famous, but the most powerful.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:50.160]   And if you become leader again, you will have unprecedented power.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.200]   Just on your own personal psychology, what does that power do to you?
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.240]   Is there any threat of it corrupting how you see the world?
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.560]   No, I don't think so.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.600]   Look, I've been there for four years.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.240]   I could have done a big number on Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:08.800]   I thought it looked terrible to take the president's wife and put her in prison.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.440]   She's so lucky.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.040]   I didn't do anything.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.840]   She's so lucky.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:20.960]   Hillary is a lucky woman because I had a lot of people pushing me to, they wanted to see
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   something.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.560]   But I could have done something very bad.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.840]   I thought it looked so bad.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   Think of it.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.480]   You have the president of the United States and you also had Secretary of State, right?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   She was.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.600]   But you're going to put the president's wife in prison?
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.320]   And yet when I got out there, you know, they have all these hoaxes.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:43.000]   They're all hoaxes, but they have all these dishonest hoaxes, just like they did in the
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   past with Russia, Russia, Russia, that was a hoax.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.080]   The 51 different, you know, agencies or agents, that was a hoax.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.320]   The whole thing was a hoax.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.760]   The whole, there was so many hoaxes and scams.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.200]   But I didn't want to put her in jail.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   And I didn't.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   And I explained it to people.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.640]   You know, they say, "Lock her up, lock her up."
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   It doesn't.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   We won.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.440]   I said, "We don't want to put her in jail.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.800]   We want to bring the country together.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.340]   I want to bring the country together."
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.200]   You don't bring the country together by putting her in jail.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.600]   But then when I got out, you know, they went to work on me.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   It's amazing.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:33.620]   And they suffer from massive Trump derangement syndrome, TDS.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.960]   And I don't know if it's curable from their standpoint.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.720]   A lot of people are very interested in footage of UFOs.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.220]   The Pentagon has released a few videos.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.660]   And there's been anecdotal reports from fighter pilots.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:55.820]   So a lot of people want to know, will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage,
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.180]   which a lot of people claim is available?
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.180]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.180]   I'll do that.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180]   I would do that.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.780]   I'd love to do that.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.880]   I have to do that.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.540]   But they also are pushing me on Kennedy.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.860]   And I did release a lot.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.440]   But I had people come to me and beg me not to do it.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.660]   But I'll be doing that very early on.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.760]   No, but I would do that.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.180]   There's a moment where you had some hesitation about Epstein, releasing some of the documents
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.180]   on Epstein.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.660]   Why the hesitation?
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660]   I don't think...
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.100]   I mean, I'm not involved.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:31.840]   I never went to his island, fortunately.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.380]   But a lot of people did.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:42.620]   Why do you think so many smart, powerful people allowed him to get so close?
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.620]   He was a good salesman.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.660]   He was a hale and hearty type of guy.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.300]   He had some nice assets that he'd throw around, like islands.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:57.260]   But a lot of big people went to that island.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.940]   But fortunately, I was not one of them.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:05.220]   It's just very strange for a lot of people that the list of clients that went to the
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.460]   island has not been made public.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.860]   It's very interesting, isn't it?
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.680]   Probably will be, by the way.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.460]   So if you were able to, you would be...
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.300]   Yeah, I'd certainly take a look at it.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.820]   Now, Kennedy's interesting because it's so many years ago.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:27.180]   They do that for danger, too, because it endangers certain people, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:32.660]   So Kennedy is very different from the Epstein thing.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.420]   But yeah, I'd be inclined to do the Epstein.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.020]   I'd have no problem with it.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.660]   That's great to hear.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.780]   What gives you strength when you're getting attacked?
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.460]   You're one of the most attacked people in the world.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.300]   I think you can't care that much.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:51.380]   I know people that care so much about everything, like what people are saying.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.820]   You can't care too much because you end up choking.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.300]   One of the tragic things about life is that it ends.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.860]   How often do you think about your death?
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.420]   Are you afraid of it?
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:10.900]   I have a friend who's very, very successful, and he's in his 80s, mid-80s.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.100]   And he asked me that exact same question.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.100]   I turned it around.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.820]   I said, "Well, what about you?"
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.460]   He said, "I think about it every minute of every day."
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.420]   And then a week later, he called me to tell me something, and he starts off the conversation
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.460]   by going, "Tick, tock, tick, tock."
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:38.700]   This is a dark person, in a sense, but it is what it is.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.260]   If you're religious, you have, I think, a better feeling toward it.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:47.020]   You're supposed to go to heaven, ideally not hell, but you're supposed to go to heaven
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.660]   if you're good.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.020]   I think our country is missing a lot of religion.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:54.580]   I think it really was a much better place with religion.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.820]   It was almost a guide, to a certain extent, it was a guide.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.620]   You want to be good to people.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.060]   Without religion, there's no real, there are no guardrails.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.100]   I'd love to see us get back to religion, more religion in this country.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.620]   Well, Mr. President, thank you for putting yourself out there, and thank you for talking
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.620]   today.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.100]   Look, I love the country.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:19.060]   I want to see the country be great, and we have a real chance of doing it, but it's our
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.860]   last chance, and I appreciate it very much.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   Thank you.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   Thank you.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.940]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Donald Trump.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:32.060]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:37.100]   And now, as I've started doing here at the end of some episodes, let me make a few comments
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.180]   and answer a few questions.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:46.460]   If you would like to submit questions, including in audio and video form, go to lexfriedman.com/ama,
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:52.180]   or get in touch with me for whatever other reason at lexfriedman.com/contact.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:57.420]   I usually do this in a T-shirt, but I figured for this episode, I'll keep my suit and tie
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   on.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:02.100]   So first, this might be a good moment to look back a bit.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:08.500]   I've been doing this podcast for over six years, and I first and foremost have to say
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   thank you.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:14.260]   I'm truly grateful for the support and the love I've gotten along the way.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:19.220]   It's been, I would say, the most unlikely journey, and on most days, I barely feel like
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.620]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.500]   But I wanted to talk a bit about how I approach these conversations.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.980]   Now, each conversation is its own unique puzzle, so I can't speak generally to how I approach
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980]   these.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:35.660]   But here, it may be useful to describe how I approach conversations with world leaders,
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:40.100]   of which I hope to have many more and do a better job every time.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.100]   I read a lot of history, and I admire the historian perspective.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:49.940]   As an example, I admire William Shire, the author of many books on Hitler, including
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.220]   The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:49:00.940]   He was there and lived through it and covered it objectively to the degree that one could.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:06.020]   Academic historians, by the way, criticize him for being a poor historian because he
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.700]   editorialized a little too much.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:15.820]   I think those same folks criticize Dan Carlin and his Hardcore History podcast.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.060]   I respect their criticism, but I fundamentally disagree.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:25.300]   So in these conversations with world leaders, I try to put on my historian hat.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:31.260]   I think in the realm of truth and public discourse, there's a spectrum between the ephemeral and
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   the eternal.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:37.940]   The outrage mob and clickbait journalists are often focused on the ephemeral, the current
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:42.460]   thing, the current viral shitstormer of mockery and derision.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:47.380]   But when the battle of the day is done, most of it will be forgotten.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:53.140]   A few true ideas will remain, and those the historian hopes to capture.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.540]   Now this is much easier said than done.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.700]   It's not just about having the right ideals and the integrity to stick by them.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:08.180]   It's not even just about having the actual skill of talking, which I still think I suck
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.700]   at, but let's say it's a work in progress.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.220]   You also have to make the scheduling work and set up the entirety of the environment
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.060]   in a way that is conducive to such a conversation.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.000]   This is hard, really hard with political and business leaders.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.780]   They are usually super busy and in some cases super nervous because, well, they've been
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.980]   screwed over so many times with clickbait gotcha journalism.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:39.320]   So to convince them and their team to talk for two, three, four, five hours is hard.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.620]   And I do think a good conversation requires that kind of duration.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.700]   And I've been thinking a lot about why.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.660]   I don't think it's just about needing the actual time of three hours to cover all the
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.580]   content.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:58.700]   I think the longer form with a hypothetical skilled conversationalist relaxes things and
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.740]   allows people to go on tangents and to banter about the details.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.940]   Because I think it's in the details that the beautiful complexity of the person is brought
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.380]   to light.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:15.020]   Anyway, I look forward to talking to more world leaders and doing a better job every
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.020]   time.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:20.540]   As I said, I would love to do interviews with Kamala Harris and some other political figures
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:27.500]   on the left and right, including Tim Walz, AOC, Bernie, Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.560]   And on the right, JD Vance, Vivek, George W and so on.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:37.220]   And on the topic of politics, let me say as an immigrant, I love this country, the United
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.620]   States of America.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.820]   I do believe it is the greatest nation on earth.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:47.080]   And I'm grateful for the people on the left and the right who step into the arena of politics
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:52.500]   to fight for this country that I do believe they all love as well.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.020]   I have reached out to Kamala Harris, but not many of the others.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.760]   I probably should do a better job of that.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   But I've been doing most of this myself.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.340]   All the reach out, scheduling, research, prep, recording, and so on.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:08.620]   And on top of that, I very much have been suffering from imposter syndrome, with a voice
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.340]   in my head constantly pointing out when I'm doing a shitty job.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:19.820]   Plus a few folks graciously remind me on the internet, the very same sentiment of this
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.100]   aforementioned voice.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.960]   All of this while I have the option of just hiding away at MIT, programming robots and
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.600]   doing some cool AI research with a few grad students, or maybe joining an AI company,
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.360]   or maybe starting my own.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.300]   All of these options make me truly happy.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.300]   But like I said, on most days, I barely know what I'm doing, so who knows what the future
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:41.300]   holds.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:47.000]   Most importantly, I'm forever grateful for all of you, for your patience and your support
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.860]   throughout this rollercoaster of a life I've been on.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.460]   I love you all.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.500]   Okay, now let me go on to some of the questions that people had.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:02.100]   I was asked by a few people to comment on Pavel Durov's arrest and on X being banned
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.100]   in Brazil.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:07.260]   Let me first briefly comment on the Durov arrest.
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.940]   So basic facts.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:14.300]   Pavel Durov is CEO of Telegram, which is a messenger app that has end-to-end encryption
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.300]   mode.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.980]   It's not on by default, and most people don't use the end-to-end encryption, but some do.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:27.260]   Pavel was arrested in France on a long list of charges related to quote-unquote criminal
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:34.300]   activity carried out on the Telegram platform and for quote-unquote providing unlicensed
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.220]   cryptology services.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:41.500]   I think Telegram is indeed used for criminal activity by a small minority of its users,
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:46.780]   for example, by terrorist groups to communicate, and I think we all agree that terrorism is
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:47.780]   bad.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.500]   But here's the problem.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:54.360]   As the old saying goes, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.940]   And there are many cases in which the world unilaterally agrees who the terrorists are.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:05.420]   But there are other cases when governments, especially authoritarian-inclined governments,
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:11.780]   tend to propagandize and just call whoever's in the opposition, whoever opposes them, terrorists.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:17.900]   There is some room for nuance here, but to me, at this time, it seems to obviously be
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:23.560]   a power grab by government wanting to have backdoor access into every platform so they
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.580]   can have censorship power against the opposition.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.680]   I think generally, government should stay out of censoring or even pressuring social
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.260]   media platforms.
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:38.660]   And I think arresting a CEO of a tech company for the things said on the platform he built
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.820]   is just nuts.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:45.100]   It has a chilling effect on him, on people working at Telegram, and on people working
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:50.740]   at every social media company, and also people thinking of launching a new social media company.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.340]   Same is the case of X being banned in Brazil.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:55:00.460]   It's I think a power grab by Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice in Brazil.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:05.020]   He ordered X to block certain accounts that are spreading quote-unquote "misinformation."
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:08.940]   Elon and X denied the request.
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:15.060]   Then de Moraes threatened to arrest X representatives in Brazil, and in response to that, X pulled
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:20.120]   the representatives out of Brazil, obviously, to protect them.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.900]   And now X having no representatives in Brazil apparently violates the law.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.980]   Based on this, de Moraes banned X in Brazil.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:34.900]   Once again, it's an authoritarian figure seeking censorship power over the channels of communication.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.900]   I understand that this is complicated, because there are evil people in the world, and part
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.980]   of the role of government is to protect us from those evil people.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:48.300]   But as Benjamin Franklin said, "Those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.300]   little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.700]   So it's a trade-off.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:59.820]   But I think in many places in the world, many governments have leaned too far away at this
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.980]   time from liberty.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:08.420]   Okay, next up, I got a question on AI, which I emotionally connected with.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.220]   I'll condense it as follows.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:17.380]   "Hello Lex, I'm a programmer, and I have a deep fear of slipping into irrelevance, because
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.940]   I am worried that AI will soon exceed my programming skills."
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:25.700]   Let me first say that I relate to your fear.
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.820]   It's scary to have a thing that gives you a career and gives you meaning to be taken
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   away.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:36.700]   For me, programming is a passion, and if not for this podcast, it would probably, at least
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.460]   in part, be my profession.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:45.300]   So I get an uncomfortable feeling every time Claude, the LLM I use for coding at this time,
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.780]   just writes a lot of excellent, approximately correct code.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:54.900]   I think you can make a good case that it already exceeds the skill of many programmers, at
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:59.300]   least in the same way that the collective intelligence of Stack Overflow exceeds the
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.260]   skill of many programmers, many individual programmers.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.220]   But in many ways, it still does not.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:12.340]   But I think eventually, more and more, the task, the profession of programming will be
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.220]   one of writing natural language prompts.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:21.620]   I think the right thing to do, and what I'm at least doing, is to ride the wave of the
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:27.380]   ever-improving code-generating LLMs and keep transforming myself into a big-picture designer
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:30.540]   versus low-level tinkerer.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:35.780]   What I'm doing and what I recommend you do is continually switch to whatever state-of-the-art
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.460]   tool is for generating code.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:42.740]   So for me currently, I recently switched from VS Code to Cursor, and before that it was
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.340]   Emacs to VS Code switch.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:53.060]   So Cursor is this editor that's based on VS Code that leans heavily on LLMs and integrates
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.660]   the code generation really nicely into the editing process.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:01.640]   So it makes it super easy to continually use the LLMs.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.060]   So what I would advise and what I'm trying to do myself is to learn how to use it and
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:08.340]   to master its code generation capabilities.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:14.020]   I personally try to now allocate a significant amount of time to designing with natural language
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.620]   first versus writing code from scratch.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:25.020]   So using my understanding of programming to edit the code that's generated by the LLM
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:29.860]   versus sort of writing it from scratch, and then using the LLM to generate small parts
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:30.860]   of the code.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.780]   I see it as a skill that I should develop in parallel to my programming skill.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.420]   I think this applies to many other careers too.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:42.740]   Don't compete with AI for your job, learn to use the AI to do that job better.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:52.060]   But yes, it is scary on some deep sort of human level, the threat of being replaced.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.620]   But at least I think we'll be okay.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:59:01.340]   All right, next up, I got a very nice audio message and question from a gentleman who
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.500]   is 27 and feeling a lot of anxiety about the future.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.260]   Just recently, he graduated with a bachelor's degree and he's thinking about going to grad
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.580]   school for biomedical engineering.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.380]   But there is a lot of anxiety.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.580]   He mentioned anxiety many times in the message.
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.320]   It took him an extra while to get his degree.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:23.380]   So he mentioned he would be 32 by the time he's done with his PhD.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.020]   So it's a big investment.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.220]   But he said in his heart, he feels like he's a scientist.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:33.220]   I think that's the most important part of his message, of your message.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:37.940]   By the way, I'll figure out how to best include audio and video messages in future episodes.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.460]   Now onto the question.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:43.820]   So thank you for telling me your story and for submitting the question.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.780]   My own life story is similar to yours.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:52.060]   I went to Drexel University for my bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.620]   And I took a while just as you're doing.
[00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:01.220]   I did a lot of non-standard things that weren't any good for some hypothetical career I'm
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.660]   supposed to have.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:10.060]   I trained and competed in judo and jiu-jitsu for my entire 20s, got a black belt from it.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:14.580]   I wrote a lot, including a lot of really crappy poetry.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:19.940]   I read a large amount of non-technical books, history, philosophy and literature.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.260]   I took courses on literature and philosophy that weren't at all required for my computer
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:29.220]   science and electrical engineering degrees, like a course on James Joyce.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.820]   I played guitar in bars around town.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:38.060]   I took a lot of technical classes, many, for example, on theoretical computer science,
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.180]   that were way more than were needed for the degree.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:47.200]   I did a lot of research and I coded up a bunch of projects that didn't directly contribute
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.140]   to my dissertation.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.800]   It was pure curiosity and the joy of exploring.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:00.900]   So like you, I took the long way home, as they say, and I regret none of it.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.100]   Throughout that, people around me, and even people who love me, wanted me to hurry up
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:12.620]   and to focus, especially because I had very little money and so I had a sense like time
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:18.740]   was running out for me to take the needed steps towards a reasonable career.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:24.760]   Just like you, I was filled with anxiety and I still am filled with anxiety to this day,
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.980]   but I think the right thing to do is not to run away from the anxiety, but to lean into
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:36.180]   it and channel it into pursuing with everything you got, the things you're passionate about.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:41.720]   As you said, very importantly, in your heart, you know you're a scientist, so that's it.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.620]   You know exactly what to do.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.320]   Pursue the desire to be a scientist with everything you got.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.680]   Get to a good grad school, find a good advisor, and do epic shit with them.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.320]   And it may turn out in the end that your life will have unexpected chapters, but as long
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.000]   as you're chasing dreams and goals with absolute, unwavering dedication, good stuff will come
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.320]   with it.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.800]   And also, try your best to be a good person.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.240]   This might be a good place to read the words "if" by Roger Kipling that I often return
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:21.200]   to when I feel lost and am looking for guidance on how to be a better man.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.140]   If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.080]   If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.220]   too.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:36.400]   If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about don't deal in lies, or
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:43.240]   being hated don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.080]   If you can dream and not make dreams your master.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.940]   If you can think and not make thoughts your aim.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:54.920]   If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:01.360]   If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:07.000]   or watch the things you gave your life to broken, and stoop and build them up with worn
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.900]   out tools.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:15.520]   If you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss,
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:22.540]   and lose and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe a word about your loss.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:28.160]   If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they're
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:35.260]   gone, and so hold on when there's nothing in you except the will which says to them,
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.920]   hold on.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.880]   If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings nor lose the common
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.960]   touch.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.600]   If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.420]   If all men count with you, but none too much.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:57.760]   If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:05.520]   is the earth and everything that's in it, and which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.320]   Thank you for listening, and see you next time.
