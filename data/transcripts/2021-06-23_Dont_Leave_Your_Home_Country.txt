[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.540]   My name is Josh Rasheeds, I'm your host.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.380]   Today on the show, I'm gonna talk to you
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.580]   about why you probably shouldn't leave your home country,
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.840]   why you should probably stay put where you are.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.920]   In the most recent Friday Q&A episode,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.020]   I dedicated the last 20 minutes of that podcast
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.220]   to simply sharing with you in a rather casual way
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.820]   some things that I really appreciate
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.520]   about the United States of America, where I currently am.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.320]   Haven't been back in a while, but here I am right now
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.260]   in Florida right now, and just,
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.340]   there are a lot of things that I appreciate
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.940]   about the United States of America broadly
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.400]   and Florida specifically.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.980]   And so if you wanna hear some of those things,
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.500]   you can listen to them in the most recent
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.280]   Friday Q&A episode.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.180]   However, I did hear from a number of listeners
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.840]   how they appreciated those thoughts.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.580]   And I realized in thinking about their responses
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.320]   that I probably haven't been as balanced
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980]   as I would like to be when talking
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.260]   about the advisability of leaving.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.300]   Anybody who's listened to Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.100]   for any time has probably heard me talk
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.460]   about how leaving can often solve problems better
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.360]   than almost any other tool.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.380]   And this is true on the micro level and on the macro level.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   When I observe the problems that people get themselves into,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.300]   I often see how if somebody would just train themselves
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   to walk away, either quite literally or figuratively,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.340]   at the first sign of danger or problems,
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.020]   they can avoid the vast majority of long-term problems
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.300]   by simply disciplining themselves to leave
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.380]   at the first sign of trouble.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.780]   And for me, while it was difficult when I was younger,
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.340]   because I had some of the youthful macho zeal to say,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.420]   "No, I'm gonna solve my problems,"
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.520]   I have since realized that there have been many times
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.340]   in my life where I have been fortunate
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.020]   that I didn't let that youthful macho zeal
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.200]   get out of control, and I simply have left
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.060]   problem situations and I've avoided situations
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.980]   that were rather difficult.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.320]   If you go through the day-to-day things
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.740]   that affect many of us, and you think about leaving
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.620]   as an option, you will realize very quickly
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.820]   that it can solve so many problems,
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.540]   whether it's the schoolyard bully.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.220]   If you're being bullied in school,
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.220]   one of the things that you can do is simply leave.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.460]   You can leave.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.280]   You can walk away from the pushing and shoving
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.540]   and shouting match.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.180]   You can not go back to that school.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.100]   You can quit the school, move to another school.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.200]   You can homeschool.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   You can just simply leave.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.060]   If you're in a, all of a sudden,
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.580]   there's an unfriendly altercation,
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780]   your local restaurant or bar or a concert
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.620]   or something like that, you can always turn around
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.700]   and walk away, and if you discipline yourself
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.380]   to simply turn around and walk away,
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.860]   you can avoid the more painful results
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.580]   that can often come from violence.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.220]   Perhaps you're going to, I don't know,
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.180]   a protest of some kind, and all of a sudden,
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.900]   things start to get unruly.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.100]   Well, if you just simply leave,
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.780]   you can avoid the majority of problems.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.700]   I was just rereading recently the book
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.540]   by Wes Denham and, I forget his co-author's name,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.300]   called Arrest Proof Yourself, to date,
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   one of the top five most popular episodes
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.660]   of Radical Personal Finance ever made,
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.660]   and as I was rereading it, I was just struck again
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.780]   by how good this advice is.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.440]   For example, the author in that book
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.860]   called How to Arrest Proof Yourself
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.860]   talks about altercations, domestic violence altercations,
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.020]   and quite literally, he talks about how there are some people
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.300]   who often get involved in domestic violence complaints
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.920]   and some people who don't, but his advice very clearly
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.300]   is if you're involved in a situation,
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.860]   your loved one is yelling at you, there's raised voices,
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.780]   you must immediately assume that the police
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.460]   have been called, and you must immediately leave.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.260]   You must terminate contact and you must walk out the door.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.740]   Don't get in the car, it's easier to find.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.900]   Walk away, go somewhere else, and solve it from a distance.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.020]   And while sometimes you recognize,
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.880]   hey, people yell at each other,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.540]   when you think about people who get in trouble, right,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.660]   with the police being called over some kind
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.460]   of allegations of violence, if they had simply followed
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.960]   that advice to leave, things would have been better, right?
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.620]   For example, if I wanna stay faithful to my wife,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.700]   what do I do?
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.900]   Well, I need to train myself that if I'm ever
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.460]   in a situation where I even have an inkling
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.900]   that something might be going in a direction
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.240]   that wouldn't result in my being faithful to my wife,
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.140]   I need to train myself to leave,
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.340]   to get up and just simply leave.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.380]   If you're involved in a company
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.380]   where something is going wrong, right,
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.940]   you're concerned, is there honesty here?
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.660]   Maybe I'm being mistreated in some way.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.940]   Maybe there's something here where, you know,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.180]   this probably isn't gonna work out for the long term.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.140]   Whatever it is, oftentimes you can simply leave.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.380]   And by the way, this protects you
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.420]   in the worst of situations, right?
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.820]   Maybe you're going to be taken advantage of
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.300]   or mistreated in some way.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.180]   Well, the best thing to do is avoid the mistreatment
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.460]   in the first place, right?
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.300]   Don't sit around and say,
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.440]   well, at least I can file a lawsuit.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.380]   No, get out of there and leave.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.220]   But even in the best of situations, right,
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.760]   sometimes people will be at a job
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.920]   and they just are looking around
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.380]   and, you know, nothing's wrong with it.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.920]   Nobody's committing any kind of criminal acts.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.840]   No one is being abused in some way,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.160]   but there's just, there's not a lot of positive things
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.780]   that can be said about the job.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.140]   Well, one of the best things you can do is simply leave
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.440]   'cause all of the time that you spend
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.960]   in that mediocre situation
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.640]   is time that you can't be then investing
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.520]   into a really positive situation.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   And so I always try to include the option
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.880]   and the possibility of leaving as a choice
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   that should be recognized and considered seriously
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.760]   as a way of solving problems.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.120]   And if you're accustomed to thinking that way,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.680]   you probably say, well, duh, Josh, well, we know that.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.120]   Like, that's obvious, right?
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.200]   But amazingly, you will find so many people
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.360]   that don't think about that.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   And often it's those who are in the most difficult
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.800]   of circumstances because there are all kinds of reasons
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.720]   why they can't leave or why they think they can't leave.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.640]   Meanwhile, you watch your children being around people
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.600]   who are not a good influence on them.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.240]   You watch your family being surrounded by circumstances
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.000]   that are terrible for you.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.360]   And you think, well, I can't leave because, because, because.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.480]   Well, the answer is yes, you can.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.920]   And of course, I've expanded this significantly
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.440]   to the county level, to the state level,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.320]   and to the country level.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.640]   If you don't like the way that you're being treated
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.360]   in the town that you live in,
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.440]   you should consider leaving and moving to a different town.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.040]   If you don't like the way that your state is treating you,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.400]   you should consider leaving and moving to a different state.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.320]   Why sit there in a place that's mistreating you
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   and be abused when you have the choice to lawfully,
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.440]   peacefully, voluntarily pick up and go somewhere else?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.200]   And you say, well, I'm gonna make it better.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.760]   I'm gonna fight, I'm gonna make it better, right?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.520]   Whether that's fighting physically
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.200]   or fighting in a court of law.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah, maybe, right?
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.960]   There are some people who do it.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.840]   But for every one person who paves the way
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.200]   with the legal victory, there are dozens of people
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.360]   who just simply had their lives slowly destroyed
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.960]   by the circumstances that they're in.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.280]   And so if you can do that, great.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.400]   But why do it if that's not for you, right?
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.600]   You should be very thoughtful about what you actually do
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.920]   and the battles that you actually engage in.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.480]   You need to be really careful.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.160]   And people often don't think about leaving.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.840]   So I have talked about leaving
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.000]   and finding things that are better.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.120]   And this is one of those things that you can continually do.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.120]   Again, better job, better town, better house, better country.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.480]   There are lots and lots of countries around the world
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.120]   that you can choose from.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.720]   And for certain people, there will be things
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.480]   that are better in another place.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.240]   On Friday, I talked about a simple example.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.840]   Let's say that you need 24-hour nursing care.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.920]   Well, if you live in a place with high cost of nursing care,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.200]   you might spend $150,000 a year
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.160]   to have that 24-hour nursing care
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.360]   and get a very poor quality product.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.880]   Well, if you leave and you go to another country
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.200]   where you can hire qualified nurses for less,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.920]   you may be able to get a better quality of care
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.360]   for yourself at $60,000 per year
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.120]   instead of $160,000 per year.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.360]   That can make a massive difference
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.160]   in your personal standard of living.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.760]   I could go on for 20 minutes with good examples,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   but I'm going to stop and I'm gonna pivot.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.360]   Because while leaving is something that can,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.920]   in many circumstances, measurably improve your life,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.160]   without question, leaving has costs.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.360]   Anytime you leave and go from one place to another place,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.160]   from one situation to another situation,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   you will face challenges.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.320]   Yes, the child who's being bullied in school
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.560]   might be able to end the current round of bullying
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.520]   by leaving one place and going somewhere else.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.760]   But they'll have to learn a whole new school,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.200]   a whole new social system, a whole new set of rules,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.480]   a whole new group of friends.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   It's not free.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.320]   And the same thing applies
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.880]   when changing your country of residence.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.000]   To do so can often be quite expensive.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.960]   Now, I've tried to acknowledge this,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.160]   and I've tried to talk about it in this way.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.840]   It's one thing to actually choose to leave,
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.200]   and it's another thing to simply be prepared to leave.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.680]   I frequently find myself consulting with people,
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.400]   and in my courses that I teach on some of these subjects,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.280]   I frequently find myself saying,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.000]   if you will simply prepare yourself to leave,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.640]   then you'll be most of the way there.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.560]   And you don't actually have to leave
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.360]   unless you're sure that you want to.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.920]   In the most recent Friday episode,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.880]   I shared that three years ago,
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.880]   I did not have the personal infrastructure in place
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.200]   where I was prepared to leave.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.920]   I didn't have another country I could move to.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   I didn't have another country I could go and work in.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.200]   I didn't have my money squared away
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   to where I could get at it in another country.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   I didn't have the infrastructure.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.520]   I didn't have the paperwork.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   I didn't have the experience.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.040]   And so I was stuck, quite literally,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.480]   in the United States.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.560]   Now, there are worse places in the world to be stuck,
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.880]   but I don't like to be stuck anywhere.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.240]   And I was stuck, quite literally, in the United States.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.400]   And it took several years of hard work
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.680]   to put in place an appropriate infrastructure
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.280]   to where as now I can choose from a handful of places
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.040]   all around the world where I can go and I can live,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.520]   I can work, I can do business,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.600]   I can support my family, I can live.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.120]   And so now, three years later,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.520]   I now look at the United States with a different attitude,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.280]   knowing I can leave.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.320]   And so now I can appreciate more easily
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   the things that are good about the United States,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.560]   the things that are good about Florida.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.280]   And I think people often experience this
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.840]   on a smaller scale, right?
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   You might grow up, a friend of mine grew up
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.440]   in small town Indiana and lives in Miami, Florida now.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.680]   And he is very much looking forward to going back
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.120]   to his small town in Indiana for the 4th of July.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.640]   And when he was younger,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   all he wanted to do was get out of there.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.760]   And now he really appreciates it for what it is.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.640]   Because he's not stuck in that small town in Indiana,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.560]   he can appreciate the small town for what it is
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.000]   and what it offers.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.960]   And so I often approach this and say,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.400]   if you'll put in place the infrastructure
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.200]   so that you know you can leave at any point in time,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.000]   and if you'll even make it so that you have good options
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.760]   elsewhere, if it's leaving countries, right?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.600]   I'll talk to someone, I'll say,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.720]   listen, do you have a home in another country?
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.840]   Do you have the paperwork necessary
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.480]   to live in another country?
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.680]   Do you have a residence permit or a citizenship?
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.040]   Do you have a driver's license?
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.640]   Do you have a local bank account?
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.200]   Do you have a home that you could go to that you know,
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.680]   a place that you're familiar with and you're accustomed to
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.280]   and you can get around, you know how to live there.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.080]   If you have those things and you maintain those things,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.280]   then you may or may not actually have to do it,
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.320]   but it'll give you that sense of peace,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.360]   that sense of security.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.560]   But should you actually go and leave?
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.320]   And I think in the majority of cases,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.160]   the answer is probably not.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.640]   Probably not.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.000]   Because leaving and actually going somewhere
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and committing to it can set you back significantly in life.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   And the older that you get, the bigger the cost is.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.640]   The cost for, you know, a young man or woman, a teenager,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.600]   someone in his or her early 20s,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.840]   the cost for that person to leave and go somewhere new
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.400]   is probably modest.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   Especially if they don't have a developed family network
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.480]   or friend network or something that they can tap into,
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.840]   it's probably modest.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.760]   But for someone who's 30 years old, 40 years old,
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.520]   50 years old, the cost of leaving and going to another place
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.360]   can be really, really substantial.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.640]   Let's talk about those costs.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.840]   I think that by far the biggest cost
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.320]   is likely to be the human cost.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.440]   And there are different components to it.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.520]   The obvious human cost that I think most people
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.800]   are tuned into would simply be the cost on your social life,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.520]   your family, your friends.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.200]   Our family and our friends are the things
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.060]   that make our local living what it is.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:31.840]   None of us live where we live
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.620]   just because of a certain geographical feature.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.160]   You can have great weather in many cities
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.000]   all around the world.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.120]   You can have great surf in many places all around the world.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.400]   You can have great skiing in many places
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.500]   all around the world.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.640]   Those factors alone are not enough of a reason
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.120]   to pick up and go somewhere new.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.360]   At least, if not for everyone,
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.300]   I think the vast majority of people.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.440]   I've never actually met someone who lives in a ski town
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.680]   who skis every day.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.960]   Even the most ardent of skiers
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   has a life outside of skiing.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.080]   The same can be applied to almost any activity.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.600]   And so, while I think you should consider those things,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.960]   realistically, you can do those things in many places
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.700]   or you can fit them into your life in many ways.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:31.000]   There are many other factors, right?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.840]   Certain freedoms to do certain things.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.960]   I wanna, I don't know, shoot my rifle off my back porch.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.600]   Okay, well, how much are you actually gonna do that?
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.000]   There are things that are very important to people, right?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.560]   I wanna be able to homeschool my children
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.080]   with minimal interference.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.720]   That's a very fair thing.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.040]   And each of us will have our own set of criteria.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   I want to live with progressive neighbors
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.760]   that match my political identification.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.720]   Great.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.280]   I want a certain kind of nightlife available to me
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.480]   at walking distance from my apartment front door.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.600]   Fine.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.420]   But at the end of the day,
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.200]   it's the people that are going to most significantly
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.160]   affect how you live.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.040]   And there can be different sides to this.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.960]   So, on the one hand, you could say,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   I wanna be close to my mom and dad.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.360]   And if you wanna be close to your mom and dad,
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.400]   you'll find that that makes a big difference
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.280]   in your lifestyle.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.360]   For some other people,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.960]   I need to get a little farther away from mom and dad.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.800]   Fair enough.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.960]   Siblings, friends, the people that we like to be with
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   make a big, big difference in our life.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.120]   Now, here's what's difficult.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.040]   I don't think anybody would say
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   that you have to be near these specific people
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.500]   in order for you to have a fulfilling social life.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.540]   You can build a fulfilling social life afresh
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.680]   in another place.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.920]   But there's something about those long-term relationships
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.060]   that lead to a real sense of fulfillment
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.760]   and satisfaction in life.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.960]   When you have those friends
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.080]   that you can truly, genuinely be yourself around,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.840]   when you can truly, genuinely feel comfortable,
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.680]   when you have those family relationships
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.840]   that tie your family together,
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.080]   potentially over the generations,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.140]   that can be extremely valuable.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.480]   It's not only valuable to you,
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.880]   it's also potentially valuable to your children.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.240]   Having your children have the context
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.560]   of a broad social network
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.040]   can make a tremendous difference in their life
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.740]   and in their sense of stability and sense of security.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.860]   With my own experience growing up,
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.520]   I always thought that it would be really fun to be homeless.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.360]   I don't know why.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.040]   Some people have, some people play golf.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.880]   I think about what it would be like to be homeless,
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.120]   and I read books and stories about homeless people,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120]   quite literally, and I tell you,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.040]   here's how I'd be a hobo, right?
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.280]   Here's how I live.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.840]   And I think that's interesting.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.200]   The problem is that, obviously,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.960]   there's a big difference between the interest of it
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.640]   and the actual doing of it.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.280]   While it's fun to think about sleeping on the street,
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   the actual experience of sleeping on the street
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.800]   is not so interesting.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.440]   But my entire life, I knew that this is just
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.160]   kind of a far-fetched mental game,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.040]   because I could never imagine
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.260]   not having a place to sleep tonight.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.120]   I could never imagine what it would be like
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.440]   to be someone who didn't know literally dozens of people
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.400]   where you could feel totally comfortable and safe
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.480]   showing up unannounced, knocking on their door,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.360]   and saying, "I'm hungry and I'm cold,"
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.520]   or, "I'm hungry and I'm hot,
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.760]   "and I don't have a place to sleep tonight.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.920]   "Can I stay here?"
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:59.960]   That's powerful in terms of a psychological profile
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.740]   that you can give to a child.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.800]   Now, unfortunately, there are many people in the world
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   who don't experience that kind of thing.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.760]   But if you have that, and then you just have this knowing,
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.040]   this knowledge that you never had to go out and acquire,
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.320]   this just sense of knowing that,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   well, my uncle so-and-so lives here,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.880]   aunt so-and-so lives there,
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.960]   my dad's friend blah, blah, blah lives over there,
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.360]   so-and-so that I knew from high school lives there,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.340]   my friend here, that broad network
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.540]   is extraordinarily powerful.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.860]   And this is my second category, is this network.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.940]   So the first category of people is friends,
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.760]   families, friends, but the network that you have in a place
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.020]   is usually what makes the biggest difference
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.320]   in your ability to navigate through it.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.400]   You're arrested by the police, you're in prison.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.100]   Who can you call who's going to start
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.060]   the appropriate processes working to get you out?
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.760]   If you can make a call to one person,
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.960]   that person says, oh, I need to call so-and-so
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.160]   as an attorney, I know so-and-so is a judge,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.360]   they'll give me advice on who I need to call.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.240]   We don't have any money, but I know so-and-so has money,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.680]   and that person will lend me money,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.760]   so if necessary, I can pay a bail charge
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.320]   and we can get Joshua out of prison.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   That kind of network is a big deal.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.880]   Who could you call to be able to get work?
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.660]   My entire lifetime, I've never worried
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.220]   about not having a job, because if I needed money,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.100]   I can pull out my phone and I can call quite literally
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.900]   hundreds of people who would know my name,
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.780]   would take my call, and would make phone calls for me
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.740]   if they didn't have something themselves.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.980]   They would say, well, Joshua, I don't have work
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.700]   for you right now, but let me call a few of my friends
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.600]   and see if we can get you work.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.340]   Again, that's a powerful benefit of having stability,
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.540]   of having a network in a place.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.980]   This goes even deeper if you're in cultures
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.580]   where the network is how you get things done.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.820]   Now, the United States is kind of a mixture
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.100]   of this type of society.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.020]   The United States is very much a world
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.520]   in which the network makes the difference for you.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   The good old boys' network is pivotal to long-term success.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.840]   You have to know how to tap into the appropriate network.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.320]   Who is the person with authority?
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.600]   Who is the person with power?
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.360]   Who is the person with connections?
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.800]   If you don't know that, you're gonna be out of luck.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.920]   But there's also a sense in which you don't need
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.240]   that stuff to survive, because the United States
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   is a very, it's a merit-focused society, a meritocracy,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.560]   and because there's this concept
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.600]   that we should all be equal before the law,
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.580]   you don't need it to survive.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.200]   If you need to go and get a driver's license,
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.740]   you just go to the driver's license DMV and get it done.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.540]   If you need a certain function done,
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.800]   if you wanna open a company,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.660]   you just go to the website and open the company.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.300]   You don't have to know somebody in government
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.540]   to get things done at that level.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.700]   That's very different in some other places.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.460]   And so if you leave the place where you have the network
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   and you go to a place where you don't,
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.580]   you can often find yourself incredibly stymied,
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.380]   just blocked.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.520]   I wanna open my company, but I need this permission,
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.580]   and I've submitted the application four times
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.340]   to the government office, and nothing gets done.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.260]   And then all of a sudden, you connect with the right person,
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.060]   and they say, oh, well, hold on a second, let me call,
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.380]   and they call so-and-so, and so-and-so
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.100]   makes the proper introduction, and all of a sudden,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.460]   your paper gets moved to the front of the line,
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.500]   and boom, you're done, stamped out the door,
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.560]   move on with life.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.180]   So you wanna be very careful before you give that up.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.780]   So think carefully about the people.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   I think this is the single biggest cost to leaving a place.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.520]   And this is a cost that grows over time.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.060]   Again, if you talk to an average, you know,
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.100]   successful 50-year-old man or woman,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.120]   and you ask them to really think about their life,
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.300]   to give up a place where you know people,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.640]   where you have a network of contacts,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.460]   that's a powerful cost.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.900]   It's on the big picture, right?
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.820]   Who do I call to bail me out of jail?
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.300]   And it's down to the little things of,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.180]   oh, yeah, I have a trusted mechanic,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.980]   or I know who I can call if I need a trusted plumber.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.000]   The knowing who to call is a big, big deal.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.840]   And I've enjoyed learning this all afresh
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.780]   in my travels over the last couple of years,
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.340]   being in some new places.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.740]   I've learned how utterly closed
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.380]   and unfriendly a society can be
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.280]   until you make the right connection.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   Now, you can make the right connection.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.040]   I've done it.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.560]   I've done it, and I can do it again.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.520]   I might do it again, who knows?
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.480]   But until you make that right connection,
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.840]   you're kind of lost.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.160]   And then you start to figure out,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.280]   ah, this is the person that's connected.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.720]   Hey, will you please help me?
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   You know, here's what I need, reach so-and-so,
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.760]   and then the network opens up for you.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.720]   But to give that up is a big, big deal.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.840]   Humans and the network, biggest cost.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.200]   I think the second biggest cost
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   to leaving is a sense of simply knowing how things work,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.120]   having a sense of just basic knowledge
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.640]   about how things are done, where I'm from.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.720]   On almost every level, in almost every society,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   there is a culture of the way things are done.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.000]   In some places, you have a very direct culture.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.400]   For example, I have a friend of mine
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.000]   that I was just talking to on the phone,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   was from a different culture,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.800]   different country, different culture.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   And every time this guy and I talk,
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.680]   he's like, "Joshua, how are you today?"
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.800]   And I'm from kind of a business,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.000]   I don't really ask people how they are much,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.680]   although 'cause I'm from the United States,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.040]   where when we ask people how they are,
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.880]   we don't actually care how they are,
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.040]   we just expect them to say fine and get to business.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.320]   And so then having spent so much of my life on the phone,
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.880]   I just learned to skip all that stuff.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.920]   And so I say, "Howdy, you know, bump and go to business."
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.960]   And there's this like awkward thing where I realize
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.280]   I'm not fulfilling the cultural norm here.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.960]   You know, I'm approaching this with the US American
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.200]   get to business mindset.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.360]   I don't wanna ask how you are,
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.000]   if you'll tell me if there's a problem,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.080]   and I care how you are,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.440]   but I don't wanna engage in these pleasantries.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.800]   And he's coming from a culture
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   where the pleasantries are important.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.360]   And so there's a little clash.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.080]   Well, take that and multiply it times 1,000.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.200]   And almost everything from how you greet somebody
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.720]   to not how you greet someone.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.920]   And I mean, quite literally, right?
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.200]   What do you say to the baker at the shop
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.040]   where you get your bread?
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.160]   Do you even get your bread from a shop
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.840]   or do you get it from a plastic bag on the shelf?
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.760]   How many times do you kiss someone on the cheek
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.360]   or not kiss them on the cheek?
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.720]   Do you, how hard do you press their hand
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.000]   when you have a handshake?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.880]   These little things are just the tip of the iceberg
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.920]   in terms of understanding how things are done,
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.600]   understanding how you interact,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.840]   understanding, well, what level of obsequiousness
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.720]   do I need to display to this government agent
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.840]   in order for me to get my document stamped
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.560]   so I can go and do my thing?
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.960]   Am I being ripped off by this guy or not?
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.240]   Is this guy mistreating me?
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.600]   Like all of this stuff, it just builds.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.320]   And it can be very, very inefficient
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.960]   if you don't know how it's done.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.200]   And so you wanna make sure that you have an understanding
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.240]   of those things.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.600]   And this is where, if you're young and you're adapt,
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.720]   or young and or adaptable in your mindset,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.040]   it's not that difficult to go to a new place
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.200]   and work your way through it.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.960]   It's kind of a sense of adventure.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.800]   But this will be very frustrating to you
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.640]   if you're old and successful and established,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.560]   and all of a sudden you find that
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.840]   I'm going right back to the beginning, right?
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.040]   I just don't know how things work here.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.000]   And that can be quite frustrating to you, so be aware of it.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.480]   Don't expect to easily go from where you know
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.880]   how everything's done, you know how it works,
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.480]   even if you don't like it, at least you know how it works,
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.400]   to a place where you don't and expect that to be easy.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.000]   Third major cost.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.760]   The time.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:29.920]   It's very, in my experience, difficult and time-consuming
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.800]   for you to learn these lessons.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   And there is a major, major element of time needed
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.160]   in order for you to get things set up.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.800]   Now, time is not the perfect category
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.920]   'cause it's time and permission.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.520]   For example, if you are from the state of Pennsylvania
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.480]   and you decide to move to Indiana,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.460]   you can accomplish that very, very quickly.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.920]   Everybody from Pennsylvania
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.000]   knows how to make things work in Indiana.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.760]   You know that if I'm gonna move my stuff,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.720]   I either need to fit it into my vehicle
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.520]   or I need to go and hire a U-Haul
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.920]   or a big yellow Ryder truck, or maybe a budget truck, right?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.000]   There's three brands of big trucks.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.840]   That's what you're gonna do.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.160]   Or you're gonna hire a mover
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.040]   who's gonna be a full-service mover.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   That's it, you know what that is.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.600]   You know that when I move from Pennsylvania to Indiana,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.440]   I'm gonna need to rent an apartment.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.600]   You understand the apartment culture.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.080]   You know what's gonna be asked of you.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   It's gonna be a first, last, first month,
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.800]   last month security deposit.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.040]   There are little regional variations, right?
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.000]   You might find a few regions of the country
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.400]   where appliances are not included.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.240]   That's different,
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.180]   but it's not that big of a hard thing to do.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.400]   Then you know I need to change my driver's license.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.080]   I need to change everything on the utilities.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.440]   And so basically in say two to three days
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.720]   of administrative work, you can have everything done.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.400]   You got your new driver's license in hand.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.160]   You got all the utilities switched over.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.960]   You're familiar with the whole process.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.320]   You've got, you're done, right?
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.920]   Two or three days, you're ready to go.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.840]   You don't have to go and deal with a work permit.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.380]   You know, hey, I'm a US citizen.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.400]   I've got my, you know, my driver's license.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.480]   This proves this.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.680]   I'm ready to go.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.440]   And so in a few days, you're ready to go.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.360]   You can start your business.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.320]   You can get your new job, whatever it is.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.280]   Things work pretty, pretty similar.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.440]   Now I want you to imagine moving to Mexico.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.240]   That's very different.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.680]   What's the name of the DMV in Mexican Spanish?
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.760]   What is, who do I talk to?
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.420]   How do I get the power turned on?
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.680]   Is it a government company or is it a local company?
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.040]   And what identification do I need?
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   And it's very difficult, very difficult.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.640]   Now you can work it out, right, with the right fixer.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.820]   Maybe you have an attorney who tells you, oh, do this.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.600]   You have a friend who does that.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.440]   But if you show up and you don't know anybody,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.360]   that's very, very difficult.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.880]   And then all of a sudden you find yourself
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.560]   waiting in lines all over the place.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.340]   It can take, I mean, can take quite literally months.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.480]   I worked my way through a residency process
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.120]   over the past few years that because of coronavirus
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.000]   wound up taking months, months and months and months.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.200]   And I had all of my T's crossed, all my I's dotted,
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.060]   and it still was months.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.160]   And so by the time I had finished the whole deal, right,
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.480]   got my residency card, got my driver's license,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.780]   just got everything lined up,
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.960]   like by the time I had done the whole thing,
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.720]   I had a huge amount of time invested into it.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.480]   I went back to the government offices countless times.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.160]   In hindsight, I promised myself, I'm not doing that again.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.940]   I will use an attorney from here on out,
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.040]   and I will just simply pay the money
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.480]   'cause it wasn't worth the time.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.240]   That time is a big deal.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.920]   Time is quite literally money.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   And so imagine doing that in a place of,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.740]   in a time of duress, right?
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.640]   Imagine that you fled your country
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.480]   because of some war or something going on,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.800]   and you had to get out.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.280]   And all of a sudden you find yourself
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   in this totally new place trying to set this stuff up.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.080]   That's incredibly stressful.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.120]   So that's why I set it up in advance.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.400]   But you probably shouldn't leave
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.260]   because you'll find the time is massive.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.800]   What about the money?
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.760]   Okay, you are going to spend a lot more money
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   if you move and leave and go elsewhere
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.280]   than you are if you stay put,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.200]   at least in the beginning.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.720]   You're gonna spend a lot more money.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.120]   I don't care how much cheaper the place is.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.800]   Or you can say, but Joshua, listen,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.360]   if I move from Pennsylvania to Mexico,
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.000]   I'm gonna cut my rent by 50% or more.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.720]   That's true.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.520]   But you're gonna spend more money on everything
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.320]   until you figure out how to go, how to go and do it.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.080]   You're gonna go buy a car.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.280]   Well, you're gonna get the gringo pricing on the car.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.980]   And you're not gonna know,
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.120]   am I getting the real price or not?
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:04.940]   You just don't know.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.920]   You don't have that intuition that you have in other things.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.040]   And can you get a car cheap?
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.400]   Yeah, but you just don't know.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.200]   When you, insurance, well, how do I get quotes on insurance?
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.040]   Who do I talk to?
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.860]   You're not familiar.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.240]   You haven't watched all the things.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.440]   Where do I go to get my kind of groceries that I want?
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.280]   Well, it takes time quite literally
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.400]   to figure out what are the grocery stores?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.840]   Where do I go to get this certain thing?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.640]   Oh, we want new curtains.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.280]   Where do I go to get new curtains for the house?
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.760]   Where do I go to get furniture?
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.140]   Where do I go to hire a painter?
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.360]   Where do I go if I wanna paint myself?
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.960]   And so you spend a lot of money figuring that stuff out.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.400]   Now, in the fullness of time, right,
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.440]   you can learn pretty quickly.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.160]   And after a few months, ah, I see.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.600]   Well, for this one, I go to this store.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.120]   For this, I go to the other store.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.560]   These things are really expensive.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.640]   So we send these things to our friend,
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.080]   and then he brings them in with us when he flies in.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.000]   You can figure it out,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.260]   but it's really expensive in the beginning.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.840]   And what I've had to learn to do
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   is to not worry about being frugal in the beginning, right?
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.040]   You go to a new place,
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.720]   you're gonna spend a lot more money
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.120]   getting everything set up.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.880]   Cab fees, government costs,
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.720]   paying a fixer to help you solve something.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.480]   Just you're gonna pay a lot more money in the beginning.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.400]   Now, if you make good decisions,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.800]   you genuinely can live in a place longer
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.360]   for a significant, for less.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.240]   But it's not longer in the short term.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.840]   Sorry, it's not less in the short term.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.400]   It's gonna be more in the short term.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.840]   And so I think you gotta give yourself some permission
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.800]   to just recognize that that's gonna be the case,
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.640]   and then make sure you have some money saved.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.440]   Now, this is true with almost any move.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.480]   Anybody moving from Pennsylvania to Indiana
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.120]   has experienced how expensive it winds up being
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.200]   because of all the costs that you didn't factor in.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.400]   Moving is expensive.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.680]   It's time consuming,
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.400]   and you gotta figure out where your new stores are
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.840]   in Indiana, just like you do in Mexico.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.340]   But these things are real factors.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.780]   And it is a big, it does make a big difference.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.600]   There are other costs as well.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.120]   Big costs.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.720]   Things like culture shock.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.440]   Now, culture shock is a somewhat ambiguous term.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.000]   I'll tell you how I have experienced culture shock.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.720]   It's not for me a specific sense of being shocked
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.760]   of here's how things are done here.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.480]   I personally am not that surprised by most things.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.600]   Like, okay, here, we don't have sit-on-them toilet seats.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.980]   We have squatting toilets.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.960]   Okay, no big deal.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.800]   Been there, done that.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.200]   That's not hard for me to deal.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.120]   Here, we eat with our hands.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.760]   Okay, fine, all good.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.360]   Here, we put lots of hot sauce and everything is spicy.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.600]   All right, I can deal with that.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.140]   Where how I've experienced a lot of culture shock
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.000]   is just a sense of not fitting in
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.480]   and a knowledge that I'll never fit in.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.060]   Now, that's interesting because I've generally been
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.960]   somewhat of an iconoclast.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.760]   I don't fit in in many circumstances.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.880]   But when you recognize I'm the foreigner
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.880]   and I'll always be the foreigner.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.720]   This is one of the places where, in my opinion,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.680]   the United States shines more than any place
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.240]   that I have been.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.940]   Maybe there are better places.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.660]   The United States is the most welcoming place
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:39.660]   I have ever been to foreigners and to foreign cultures.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:46.320]   You can assimilate into the American culture so quickly
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.440]   and Americans will accept you no matter where you're from.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.600]   And it doesn't mean they'll ignore the fact that,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.560]   ah, you're originally from Pakistan.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.420]   But Americans don't hold it against you.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.440]   There's not a culture, not a country, not an ethnicity,
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.780]   not a color of skin that is not easily accepted
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.800]   in the United States of America.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.260]   And I wish more people noticed that,
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.960]   more people appreciated that,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.180]   that you'll never find someone saying to you,
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.140]   oh, I'm an American citizen.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.680]   And you'll never find someone who's surprised
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.080]   at the color of your skin or how you speak
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.160]   or your accent or anything like that.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.780]   The most accepting, welcoming country I've ever been to.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.280]   My experience, it is not that way
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.080]   in many other regions of the world
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:44.280]   where ethnicity, cultural identity reigns supreme.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.340]   I find, in my experience, for example,
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:53.640]   and I find that Asia is the most racist region
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.520]   of the world I've ever been to.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.880]   But it's kind of a weird, a weird thing.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   Because on the one hand, I'm very rarely mistreated.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.600]   I'm often treated very well, right?
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.000]   You get extra benefits and privileges
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.060]   from being the wealthy white foreigner.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.160]   But you never fit in, right?
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.660]   I will never, no matter how perfect my Chinese,
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.720]   I'll never be accepted as Chinese.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.380]   And this is similar in many countries in the world.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.340]   That's a hard thing to swallow, right?
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.540]   It's hard to always be the outsider.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.980]   It's hard to be the outcast.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.140]   It's hard to be the guy who will never fit in.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.740]   And that's significant.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.800]   Now, boo-hoo, right?
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.020]   Throughout all of humanity's history,
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.800]   people have wandered around, they've moved from here,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.540]   moved to there, and they have not fit in, right?
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.840]   Boo-hoo.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.640]   There's no point in crying about it.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.520]   But it is something that you're gonna face
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.920]   and you're gonna experience.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.600]   And I think that you should be just thoughtful about it.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.360]   I think it's a big deal to make sure
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.900]   that if you do go somewhere, that you go to a place
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.760]   where you feel like, maybe I'll never be perfectly accepted.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.920]   Maybe I'll always be the foreigner.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.860]   But at least I like this.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.480]   I think here, there's a good argument
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.440]   for places that are very foreigner-friendly, right?
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.120]   A Dubai, somewhere that's super international
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.080]   and virtually nobody is from here, but we're all here, right?
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.680]   Or you get into a bigger city, right?
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.280]   An international-level city
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.400]   where you don't get stared at all the time
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.100]   and everything is a little bit more easygoing.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.520]   But those things are costs
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.160]   and they can affect you over time
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.720]   and they're worth considering.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.200]   In my course that I teach on,
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.760]   that includes a lot of internationalization,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.480]   how to survive the coming economic crisis,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:01.340]   I strongly advise against moving outside of your country.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.000]   I think that if you're experiencing
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.960]   an economic crisis in Florida,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.020]   it'll be easier for you to get in your car
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.280]   and drive to Maine or to Texas or to Alaska
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.960]   and try to make it there,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.760]   than it will be for you to get in your car
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.640]   and drive to Mexico City and try to make it there.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.160]   Or get in a boat and go to the Bahamas
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.800]   and try to make it there, right?
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.640]   You probably, especially in a time of crisis,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.340]   you should stay in your home country
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.720]   where you have the appropriate paperwork,
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.980]   the ability to, the right, the legal right to work,
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.540]   the simplicity of proving citizenship
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.960]   and belonging and all that stuff
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.060]   where you speak the language.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.920]   I didn't even talk about language difficulties
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.360]   if you're in a place with multiple,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.160]   that's a different language than your home language.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.560]   I think that you're better off
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.080]   staying in the majority of those circumstances.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.380]   That's not to say you're better off
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.080]   staying in all circumstances.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.720]   And even in that course, I talk through it.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.640]   What are the issues that could affect you, right?
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.700]   You can have genuinely national level issues.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.520]   You could have a national political crisis, right?
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   You could be somebody who is facing persecution.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   In a certain country, it can be political persecution,
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.960]   religious persecution, racial persecution,
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.880]   facing some kind of persecution.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.640]   You could be facing some personal sense of,
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.600]   you know, you're accused of committing some crime.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.440]   And the only way you can get,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.360]   you're accused falsely,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.880]   you're not morally responsible for something,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.800]   but you are in legal trouble, there's warrants out for you.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.720]   Well, the only way you solve that
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.560]   is either by dealing with it head on or by leaving.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.960]   And so that's a really good reason to leave.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.120]   You could be facing some kind of
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   thing that just makes life really difficult, right?
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.800]   Maybe, I have a friend of mine recently got a DUI, right?
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.840]   Okay, well, you got a DUI, you can't drive,
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.280]   license is suspended.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.400]   Well, why are you gonna sit here in the United States
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.560]   where you can't drive,
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.720]   and yet you live in a driving culture
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.360]   and pay thousands and thousands of dollars in Uber fees
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.440]   when you can hop on an airplane and go to London
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.480]   and live in London for a while
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.760]   and enjoy the public transportation system?
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.440]   Why, why not, right?
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.340]   So your national level problem can be solved
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.080]   by you simply moving.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   Or there could be a massive economic crisis.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.680]   There could be an economic crisis in the currency, right?
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.600]   The currency collapse of some kind.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.560]   There could be currency control laws.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.760]   Many things can happen on a national level.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.280]   And for those circumstances,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.040]   I believe that an international relocation
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.920]   is your simplest and best tool to solve that.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.800]   But the international relocation
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.120]   doesn't have to be permanent, right?
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   It can go for a few years, and that'll solve many problems.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:54.120]   And it'll be, and if you do choose it,
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.640]   you can choose it and be quite happy
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.220]   as long as you go in with your eyes open, right?
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.700]   I don't know where I'm gonna live in the future.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.760]   I do know that I could move back to the United States now
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.320]   much more contentedly than I could have a few years ago.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.260]   And I'm very aware of these issues.
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:17.540]   I'm aware of the cost to my personal network.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.000]   I'm aware of the cost to my children.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.480]   I'm aware of, I think a lot, right?
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.360]   Am I doing the right thing?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.640]   Will my children have that same sense of security
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.280]   if I'm traveling a lot or if I'm not in my hometown?
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.560]   Will they have that same sense of security that I had?
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.540]   If not, am I setting them up to be unstable people?
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.160]   Wish there were a handbook that told you all the answers,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.260]   but unfortunately you find as a parent they're not, right?
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.260]   You're trying to judge and just think critically about them.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.360]   So I could move back to the United States
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.160]   or I could quite happily continue to live
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.360]   in other places around the world, I think.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.320]   Time will tell.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:02.400]   But don't let anyone tell you that moving
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.060]   and leaving your country is gonna be all good.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.460]   When I say it like that, then you say,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.980]   of course, I know, Joshua, it wouldn't be all good.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.060]   But I wanna emphasize, don't let anyone tell you
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.820]   it's going to be all good.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.740]   Don't let anyone just focus on the rosy picture
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.620]   on how things are gonna be great.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.460]   There will be some things that you will be able to enjoy
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.060]   about, look how amazing this new place is.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.400]   Look at how this is so much better.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.340]   That is so much better.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.920]   I feel so much better here.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.180]   But there are also gonna be a whole set of things
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.340]   that you're gonna miss.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.660]   So recognize that that'll be the case
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.120]   and then make sure that your reasons
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.340]   are strong enough for going.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.960]   I hope that talking through some of these costs,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.540]   some of these reasons not to go somewhere
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.900]   will help you to think about them.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.900]   And then my closing encouragement is this.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:03.040]   Take advantage of the benefits of wherever you live.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.460]   Doesn't matter where it is.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.020]   Wherever you are now, make sure that if you recognize,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.980]   hey, my network is gonna make a big difference
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.100]   to my future success.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.740]   Am I actively and intentionally cultivating a network?
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.740]   One of the things that I have done
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.660]   over the last couple of years for the very first time
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.380]   was start from scratch, not knowing anybody
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.500]   and saying, can I build a network of friends,
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.340]   connections, relationships?
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.980]   You can do it.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.060]   Can you do it intentionally?
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.780]   Can you recognize that this network that I build
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.380]   of contacts in a new place
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.240]   is gonna make all the difference?
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.740]   Because leaving is still gonna be a powerful tool,
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.260]   especially if you need to get away from something rough.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.460]   Maybe you hung out with the wrong sort of crowd,
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.020]   got in trouble with the wrong people,
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.380]   and you want a fresh start.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.140]   Brother, get in your car and drive.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.980]   Go to a new town, get in with the right sort of crowd,
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   get a fresh start.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.100]   Even if it's something as simple as,
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.520]   you know, you got your fat loser friends,
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.660]   you're gonna be fat and a loser like your friends.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.140]   Then all of a sudden you start hanging out
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.340]   with some buff chads that you meet at the local park.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.820]   Well, you're gonna look a little different
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.780]   if those guys are your buddies.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.160]   You ever notice just groups of friends
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.540]   always look the same?
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.900]   I was at the airport last week
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.460]   and these like 10 guys come in.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.620]   They're all American guys.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.660]   We were flying from Costa Rica to Florida.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.660]   And these 10 guys come in
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.900]   and they'd all been on a buddy trip.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.760]   But they looked like spitting images of each other.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.820]   They're all tall, all muscular to some extent,
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.340]   obviously differences, but none of them were fat.
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.060]   They looked all identical.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.460]   And yet I'm listening to them
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.560]   and they're from all over the country,
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.100]   but this was their buddy group, right?
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.820]   And that's why I'm just thinking about
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.040]   how like you look like your friends.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.640]   You're gonna do the same kinds of things with your friends.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.460]   Sometimes, best way to change your life
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.120]   is change your friends.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.500]   So always recognize this as an option.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.180]   Nothing is gonna come free.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.560]   You can genuinely live better in another place, right?
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.780]   Go where you're treated best,
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.720]   as Andrew Henderson is wont to say.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.560]   But,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.420]   recognize it's not gonna be free.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.080]   So if you're looking for kind of a halfway measure,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.660]   some people don't do well with halfway measures,
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.060]   some people do.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.880]   But if you're looking for a halfway measure,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.980]   go and just start spending time in a place.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.900]   Takes time to figure out where am I gonna live.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.620]   Takes time to get your paperwork sorted out.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.820]   Get your residency visas,
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.940]   get your driver's license squared away.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.080]   Get your utilities in your name, et cetera.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.340]   You don't have to go all at once.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.260]   But then you'll get an accurate idea
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.060]   and you can count the cost more thoroughly.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.900]   Hope that helps.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.100]   If you've got more specific questions,
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.380]   I'd love to talk to you on the next Q&A show.
