[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   - Well, do you believe in the efficient market hypothesis?
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.800]   - I'd like to, but I'm like trying to wrap my head
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.640]   around Enron.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.960]   - I'm not sure how you can, unless you adopt
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.100]   Warren Buffet's point of view, and I'm gonna mangle
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.780]   the quote because, but it said the market in the short term
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.480]   is a voting machine, in the long term,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.400]   it's a weighing machine, right?
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.720]   The other way around.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.520]   Anyway, the idea is that the market may be dairy efficient
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.260]   for a long, very inefficient for a long period of time,
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800]   but it does actually, rationality does actually work
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.960]   in the end, and I think I might believe that.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.360]   But isn't it John Maynard Keynes who said the market
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.080]   can remain irrational for a lot longer
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.680]   than you can remain solvent?
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.600]   And so I think that's true, too.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200]   I think believing that the market is efficient
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.440]   and rational in the short term is just obviously wrong.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.440]   (gibberish)
