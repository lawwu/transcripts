[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   You can use auto slash two ways.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.560]   Number one is you can request a quote.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.040]   We ask you where you're picking up,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.240]   when you're picking up, where you're dropping off.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.560]   And then we ask you which organizations you're a member of,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.380]   which discounts you qualify for.
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.440]   So for example, if you're a AAA member or a Costco member,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.640]   if you're a member of AARP, if you're old like me
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.840]   and you've got AARP membership,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.040]   hey, that can get you a great deal.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.480]   And then what we do is we send you an email
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.440]   within about five minutes.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.360]   We crunch the numbers.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.560]   We let you know where the best deal is.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.200]   You could go and you could go and crunch the numbers yourself.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.480]   You can go and go to 10 different websites
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.160]   and try to beat our rate.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.320]   You can go and compare the AAA rate
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.200]   versus the Costco rate versus the AARP rate
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.760]   and maintain a spreadsheet.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520]   But it's unlikely you're gonna be able
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.360]   to find a lower rate than what we can offer.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.280]   You're welcome to try.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.120]   But the thing is, just because you have the best rate today
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.880]   doesn't mean you're gonna have the best rate tomorrow
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.560]   or next week or even the day before you pick up the car.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.440]   And that's why we offer a tracking function.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.200]   And essentially what happens is after you book your rental,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.120]   you track your reservation with us
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.840]   and we will keep looking for better deals
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.040]   right up until the day that you pick up your car.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280]   Rental rates fluctuate all the time.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880]   We will find you the best deal upfront,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.800]   but oftentimes the customers who do the best with us
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.120]   are the ones who are tracking their reservation with us.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.200]   Some customers get three, four, five,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.880]   sometimes 10 price drops over the course of a few months.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.320]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.520]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240]   and I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.680]   to help you get the best experience in life
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.800]   without the expensive price tag.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.000]   And today is no exception because we're gonna cover
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.600]   one of the top requested topics on the show,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.440]   saving and getting deals on rental cars.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.080]   And to do that, I'm joined by Jonathan Weinberg,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.960]   who is the most knowledgeable person
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.000]   I have ever met on the topic.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.160]   That's probably because over a decade ago,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.560]   he took his knack for gaming the system
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.920]   and started Auto Slash, a company dedicated
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.440]   to finding customers the best possible deals
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.640]   when they rent a car.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.160]   And to date, they've saved customers over $100 million.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.760]   We're gonna cover so much in this conversation,
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.560]   including discount codes for cheaper rentals,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.920]   when you should look off airport to save,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.400]   how signing up for different rental company programs
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.640]   can save you a ton of time at pickup,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.840]   and whether you need to prepay for gas
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.880]   or get that costly insurance policy from the agency.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.040]   And that's not even scratching the surface.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.840]   I seriously have pages of notes and questions
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.480]   because I wanna cover it all so you can save
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.200]   as much as possible on your next rental.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.480]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.360]   Jonathan, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.480]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.360]   - Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.000]   We've gotten a lot of requests to talk about rental cars
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.680]   and specifically a couple of requests
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.080]   to have you on as a guest.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.520]   Someone actually emailed me and said,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   "Could you get Jonathan on?"
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   I heard him on a podcast, it was great.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.680]   I have a lot more questions, bring him on.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.480]   So you were one of the top requested people
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.040]   on one of the top requested topics.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.560]   It is awesome to have you here.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.800]   - I love it, thank you.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.840]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.760]   - So I feel like a lot of people have hotels
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.840]   and flights figured out,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.240]   but they still don't know much about rental cars.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.920]   I feel like the past two years
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.200]   have been a bit crazy for travel.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.920]   What is the state of rental cars today?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800]   I've heard you a year or two ago say
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.400]   we're in this rental car apocalypse,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.880]   but have things changed?
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   Where are we now?
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.080]   - Yeah, we actually coined the term rental car apocalypse.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.800]   We were way out ahead of this thing.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.840]   We were seeing sort of the bleeding edge
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.280]   of the problems in 2021 as spring came along
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.520]   and people started to get vaccinated
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.680]   and the whole rental car industry
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.480]   just basically imploded at that point.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   It was almost impossible to find rentals
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.680]   and things were going for $250 a day.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.440]   People were renting U-Haul trucks
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.120]   because they couldn't find rental cars.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.160]   The good news is that things
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.600]   have gotten significantly better.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.120]   We're definitely not back to quote unquote normal.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.360]   Rates are still much higher than average,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   but the inventory situation has let up a little bit.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.680]   The rental car industry,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.280]   if we just do a little bit of mini history
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   going back to the beginning of COVID,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.040]   when COVID first hit,
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.080]   the rental car companies saw their demand drop
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   about by up to 90%
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.800]   and they basically went into survival mode.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.880]   They had to sell off as many cars as they could
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.440]   as quickly as they could just in order to survive.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.280]   And Hertz still lives today,
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.840]   but they went through a bankruptcy
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.240]   and the existing shareholders were basically wiped out.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.000]   So, and there were a couple of other smaller companies
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.040]   that either went through reorganization or bankruptcy.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.800]   So the industry was reeling from that.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.720]   But for the most part,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.600]   the industry sold off inventory that it had to
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.000]   and it got healthy
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   and demand was sort of right size
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.480]   for what the inventory was at the time.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.320]   But if you fast forward to 2021,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.800]   people started to get vaccinated.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.280]   They were just tired of being at home.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.760]   They wanted to get out
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.440]   and the demand just completely outstripped the supply.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   And the rental car companies just assumed
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.920]   that they'd be able to acquire more vehicles
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.000]   when that demand came back.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.120]   But the problem is that that idea ran headlong
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.160]   into the reality of this semiconductor shortage,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.480]   this chip shortage.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.960]   And for those of you who don't know,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.200]   there are, the average car has anywhere
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   from 1,000 to 2,000 computer chips in it.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.120]   And if you can't get those computer chips,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.400]   you're basically just looking at a giant doorstop
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.560]   with four wheels.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.880]   And that's essentially what was happening
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.120]   with the auto manufacturers.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.760]   These cars were sitting on the lots half completed
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.120]   and they just literally couldn't get them
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.760]   into the dealerships in a completed way.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.120]   And that was affecting the entire auto industry
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.880]   and no one more so than the rental car companies
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.840]   who needed these vehicles to service this demand
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.520]   that was quickly coming back.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.800]   - And so are we still in this state
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   or what are things like now?
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.920]   I remember hearing, you know, states,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.880]   entire states were sold out of rental cars.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.680]   People were nervous that you'd show up and there's no car.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.800]   Is it a little better now or a lot better?
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.320]   - You know, it's a little better,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.920]   but interestingly that the problems
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.560]   have sort of moved and morphed.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.920]   Now there are strangely entire countries
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.080]   that are sold out of rental cars.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.600]   And by that, I mean that almost the entire country of Canada
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.320]   it's almost impossible to find a rental car.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.280]   Places like Calgary and Vancouver and Victoria and Toronto,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.800]   just massive shortage of rental cars right now.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.080]   And we're not quite sure why Canada is being hit so hard,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   but the US, the lower 48 states are in better shape,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.720]   save for the national park areas, Glacier National Park,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.680]   Bozeman, Montana, anywhere around the national park,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   people are really wanna get out in the great outdoors.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.240]   And I think that COVID has sort of shifted
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.560]   demand patterns a little bit less.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.840]   People are traveling overseas,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   more people wanna travel domestically
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.600]   and we're seeing super tight availability
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.840]   around the national parks.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.760]   I'm actually going to Glacier National Park tomorrow.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.040]   And because I couldn't find a rental car
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.200]   around Glacier Airport, I ended up flying up to Calgary
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   and then ended up kind of morphing it
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.000]   into a trip to Banff and Glacier
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.480]   because rental cars were better availability
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.520]   and better pricing up in Canada than they were
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.360]   here in the US.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.040]   But even up in Calgary now,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.760]   it's impossible to find a rental car.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.040]   So I just got lucky when I was looking.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.440]   - So you just said something that's interesting.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.200]   I feel like rental cars historically,
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   maybe prior to the pandemic, were always this thing
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.400]   where it's like, well, I'm gonna book my flight,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.320]   I'll book my hotels,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.360]   and then I'm just gonna go get a rental car.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.400]   And I assume that it was actually a cheaper total package
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.160]   for you to go somewhere else,
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   but you wouldn't have known that
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.840]   if you didn't look at the rental cars in advance.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.320]   Where do rental cars fit in this?
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.280]   Do you think there's something people should be looking at
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   before they even consider their flight or hotel
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.240]   all at the same time?
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.080]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.320]   I mean, rental cars historically have been
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.960]   what I like to say,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.400]   the red-headed stepchild to the travel industry
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.360]   and no ding against redheads out there.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.280]   But people typically would go,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.480]   and as you said, they'd book their flight, their hotel,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.400]   and rental cars, they'd book it when they got around to it.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.000]   Well, you really need to turn that process on its head now.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.920]   You need to look at rental car pricing
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.680]   and even more so availability first
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.760]   before you even book your flight.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.720]   Last year, we had a lot of people who were telling us
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.680]   that they went and they booked flights,
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.440]   and then they realized that they couldn't get a rental car,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.120]   especially in areas like Florida and Phoenix and Las Vegas.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.400]   And they basically canceled the trip
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.920]   because they didn't wanna be landlocked,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.680]   they didn't wanna be stuck at a resort
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.200]   or not able to get around.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.880]   So people essentially just,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.560]   thankfully there was a flight flexibility
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.320]   in terms of cancellations and rebooking.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   So they decided to just move their trip
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.600]   later in the season
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.280]   because they couldn't get a car
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.560]   at the time that they originally wanted to go.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.920]   So people are starting to realize
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.560]   that the old rules don't apply anymore.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.040]   The rental cars used to go for as little as $6, $8 a day,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.880]   no longer.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.480]   You're looking at basically 80 to $100 a day
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   in many areas of the country.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.880]   And if you're looking for like a minivan
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   or a full-size SUV,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.480]   anything that seats more than five people,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.320]   good luck with that
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.080]   because you're gonna be paying through the nose
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.360]   if you can find one at all.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   - Wow.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.920]   And I live in the Bay Area where we have three airports.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.000]   So I'm just thinking, gosh, I don't usually fly here,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.120]   but if I did,
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.720]   it would at least be worth checking all three airports
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.960]   'cause you might pay $50 more to fly to one,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.720]   but you might save 30, $40 a day on a rental car
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.520]   if you need a car in the first place.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.360]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.040]   And we always recommend to people that,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.120]   check multiple options.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.320]   That includes both airport and off airport.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.200]   You can fly into the airport
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   and if you're arriving during normal business hours,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.560]   you can take an Uber or Lyft
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.800]   and head to an off airport location,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.120]   oftentimes save a significant amount of money.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.160]   But the flip side is also true.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.280]   People who will typically look to rent off airport,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.560]   off airport isn't always cheaper
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.720]   and it's always worth checking the airports as well.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.120]   So you wanna kind of cast a wider net
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   and oftentimes that can save you
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.360]   a significant amount of money.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.320]   - Yeah, and one thing I think I realized is off airport,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.400]   sometimes it's not, the opening hours
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.600]   aren't as great as the airport.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.520]   The airport might be open 24/7,
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.120]   but you book off airport and you schedule a 9 p.m. pickup,
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.200]   maybe it's open, but check how late it's open
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.440]   'cause if your flight's delayed and you can't get the car,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.920]   it might be a little bit of a pain.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.200]   - Yeah, general rule of thumb is off airport locations
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.480]   are typically open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.720]   And it's interesting, one thing that changed with COVID
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.120]   and I'm not quite sure why this is,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.840]   but 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. was normal operating hours,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.240]   but a lot of locations were seeing 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.800]   In fact, San Francisco, the city of San Francisco,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.520]   there are no rental car, off airport rental car locations
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.320]   that are open past 5 p.m.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   And that was not the case pre-COVID.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.080]   So for whatever reason, they just decided
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   to kind of scale back their operating hours
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.440]   and we're seeing that in a number of different cities.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.600]   - So I wanna walk through a bit of the process
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.320]   of all the things, you know, you gotta book the car,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.440]   you gotta show up and rent it,
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.200]   maybe you wanna return it late.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   So I'll start with when you're just searching,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.160]   I wanna understand what is it about rental cars
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.680]   and maybe the way the backend inventory works
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.280]   that makes it so hard.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.160]   I know sometimes I'm looking for a car,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.760]   I go to a rental car website,
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.520]   and if you wanna search off airport,
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.440]   you know, I think at Enterprise,
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.520]   you have to search airport or location
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.240]   by location by location.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.760]   I know there's aggregators to search,
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.280]   but before we even get in,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.920]   is there a reason why rental car searching
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   is so much harder than maybe flights or hotels?
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.360]   - We've had people ask us before,
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.640]   can I do kind of like a flexible search
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.840]   and show me the cheapest rental car within an entire state?
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.600]   But it's not so easy because you're typically searching
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.640]   for anywhere up to, you know, 25 vehicles per search.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   The date and time make a difference
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.440]   in terms of when you're picking up, when you're returning.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.800]   There can be a huge amount of results that come back.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.640]   So rental car searching is a fairly intensive process.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.360]   Unlike a flight where, you know,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.720]   there's a limited number of flights per day,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   there's a limited number of, you know, your cabins,
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.880]   your either, you know, business class, premium economy,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.360]   economy with rental cars,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.200]   you've got like 50 different vehicle types.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.960]   Changing the pickup time by even a few minutes
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.400]   can change the price.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.480]   And then you've got, you know,
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.400]   sometimes hundreds of locations in a particular area.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.320]   So typically a rental car search will operate
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.560]   up to 25 miles from a given radius,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   but there isn't any way to do a true flexible date search
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.520]   or flexible location search with rental cars
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.040]   just because the amount of data
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.240]   that's coming back is tremendous.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.480]   And that's one of the things that, you know,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.280]   we deal with at AutoSlash is, you know,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.720]   how to take this gigantic results set
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.160]   and make sense out of it
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.800]   and try to return the most accurate results to folks
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   that are as close a match
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.280]   to what they were looking for as possible.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.960]   Like, for example, you know,
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.440]   should we return a result that is 10 miles away
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.280]   from the location the user requested if it's, you know,
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.040]   20% less or does the user care more about convenience
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.360]   than they care about price?
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.320]   You know, that's the type of questions
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.920]   that we struggle with all the time.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.240]   It's like, how do you surface the most accurate results
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   for those users that is, you know,
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.960]   most likely to meet their needs?
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   - One hack, and I think I heard it from you
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   on another podcast was that if you are trying to rent a car
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   and save money and you look off airport,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.280]   sometimes you can actually,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.840]   you might have to be inconvenienced on the pickup,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.400]   but you might not pay any extra to return it to the airport.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.360]   So you might be able to avoid half the inconvenience.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.400]   - Right, and there's so many different permutations
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.240]   if you think about it,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.120]   because you can rent off airport, return on airport.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.080]   You can rent off airport, return off airport.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.560]   You can rent on, return on, rent on, return off.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.440]   I mean, and you know, there's all sorts of, you know,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.160]   you can play around with different locations.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.360]   So it's a question of, okay,
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.120]   well, how far do I want to take an Uber
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.400]   and how much is it going to save me?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.160]   You know, is it worth taking Uber 25 minutes away?
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.480]   But, you know, if you need, if you're going on a road trip
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.000]   and you're going to have that car for two weeks
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.960]   and you save yourself $800, you know,
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.320]   it's almost like a no brainer,
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.200]   but yet we have customers that say,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.800]   "Hey, I don't want to take an Uber for 25 minutes
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.240]   and I'll pay the extra $800."
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.080]   That's not me.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.040]   I'm a cheap SOB, but you know, hey, it's like, you know,
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.560]   whatever the customer wants.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.240]   - And is there a way to search airport
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.760]   and off airport anywhere?
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.080]   I haven't ever seen that.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.920]   How does that work?
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.480]   Is it just two searches?
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.440]   - Typically two searches.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.800]   That's something that we're actually working on
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.000]   so people can let us know that, you know, airport,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.800]   off airport and airport will work for them.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.440]   We can do a flexible search,
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.400]   but we kind of do that automatically.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.080]   Auto search works a little bit differently
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.920]   from other websites in the sense that
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.160]   if you put in a request to our site
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.680]   and we don't find availability,
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.200]   we will automatically switch that request
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.640]   to where we do find availability.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.320]   So for example, if you're requesting a car off airport
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.720]   and you're looking to pick it up at eight o'clock PM,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.560]   you know, off airport location to close,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.000]   we'll automatically move it to the airport
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.400]   or we'll adjust your time.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.920]   If you're looking to pick up a minivan at the airport,
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.440]   there's no minivans available,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.120]   we'll switch your request off airport.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.720]   If you go to any other car rental website,
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.440]   they basically just say, "Sorry, no results found."
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.280]   We've actually got a team behind the scenes,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.320]   sort of a magician behind the curtain
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.360]   that looks at your request and says,
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.840]   "Hey, why didn't this request return any availability?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.760]   What can we do to get this person into a vehicle?"
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.400]   So that's something where we're kind of mating
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.240]   the human touch along with the technology
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.960]   in order to find customers the best deal,
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.520]   or in some cases, find any deal.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.960]   Because these folks, many of them,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.000]   they're, you know, we're like their 10th stop.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.440]   They've gone to 10 other websites,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.400]   they're looking for availability.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.280]   All 10 websites say, "No availability found."
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.280]   AutoSlash will come back and say,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.640]   "Hey, we adjusted your request slightly.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.400]   We've actually did find availability.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.080]   You may have to pick up a little bit earlier.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   You may have to drop off a little bit later.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.000]   You may have to switch vehicle types,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.480]   but here's the closest match to what we could find
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.240]   to what you originally requested."
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.080]   - That's great.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.200]   And you said people search all over.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.400]   Does it actually matter with rental cars
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.240]   where you end up ultimately booking?
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.120]   Obviously, I know you'd probably prefer
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.320]   everyone book on AutoSlash,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.400]   but are there different rates on different sites,
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.000]   whether it's directly with the agency or on an OTA?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.560]   - It can make a difference.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.280]   We try to have the best rates in the industry,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.800]   prepaid rates versus post-pay rates.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.560]   We're not a big fan of prepaid rates,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.680]   at least not ones that you can't cancel without a penalty.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.040]   We believe that pay later is a much better option
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.520]   because you can cancel and rebook
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.920]   anytime a better deal comes along.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.680]   And that's one of the primary things
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   that we've kind of pioneered a niche for ourselves with that.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.160]   But yes, you can save money in some cases,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.320]   things like Priceline Express deals or Hotwire Hot Deals.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.680]   If you're willing to lock yourself in,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.600]   you can plan a better deal.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.320]   So yeah, it does make a difference where you book
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.160]   and what price you're gonna get.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.400]   Ultimately though, the rental is gonna be confirmed
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   with the car rental company.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.760]   You're gonna get a confirmation number
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.120]   from the car rental company.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.560]   So it doesn't really matter
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.680]   where the initial booking was made.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.480]   You're gonna be able to take advantage of the benefits
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.760]   that are afforded to you by the rental car company,
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.080]   as long as you can like enter your loyalty number.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.320]   And that's something that you can do through auto slash,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.080]   you can skip the counter with National,
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.320]   with Hertz, with Avis, you can earn points,
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.680]   you can get upgrades, that sort of thing.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.720]   The rules are a little bit different with prepaid rentals,
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.600]   but ultimately it does make a difference
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.120]   where you book is the short answer.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.400]   - Yep, and one thing I've noticed
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.560]   when I was booking rental cars
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.840]   is that the various discounts from programs,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.120]   whether it's Amex or your employer or Costco
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.440]   or something like that,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.800]   without those rates, like they can have a huge impact.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.880]   Is it almost fair to say,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   like if you're not booking with any of those
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.720]   and you're eligible,
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.240]   you're probably not gonna get the best rate?
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.080]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.360]   If you're not using a discount code,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.200]   you're leaving money on the table.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   If your employer has a discount code,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.820]   it's certainly one place that I would start.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.560]   The great thing about auto slash though,
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.880]   for those people who don't have an employer discount code
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.480]   or even who do have one,
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.140]   but it may not necessarily be the best deal,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.640]   is that you use auto slash,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.920]   because what we do is we give you a bunch of checkboxes
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.920]   through our wizard, we call it our quote wizard.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.360]   And that's just like a little mini interview
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.480]   that takes you through what your rental needs are.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.040]   And if you're a member of Costco, AAA, AARP,
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.160]   United Airlines Frequent Flyer Program,
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.280]   whatever organizations that are out there
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.080]   that may provide a discount,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.280]   you can just check those boxes
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.520]   and we'll compare all those rates side by side.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.360]   In addition to all the coupons and discount codes
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.960]   that the rental car companies publish on their own websites,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.600]   and some of them that were not well known,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.040]   they publish them on their Twitter feeds,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.240]   or we get them an email,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.280]   or we find them through other customers
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.320]   will let us know sometimes.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   So computers are very good at doing
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.120]   a lot of analysis very quickly.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.840]   So yeah, you could break out your Google sheet or Excel,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.280]   and you can start searching through AAA.com
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.320]   and costcotravel.com and AARP and Expedia and Priceline,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.640]   but you're just gonna end up wasting a lot of time
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.920]   and you're probably not gonna end up
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.440]   finding the lowest rate possible.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.240]   AutoSearch can do that in about 30 seconds
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   and then send you an email.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.360]   So it saves you not only money, but time as well.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.560]   You kind of get your life back
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.880]   and not have to bother with that.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.840]   We've had a lot of customers who've told us,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.120]   "Hey, I used to go and spend a half an hour
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.480]   "at least on each rental trying to find the best deal.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.560]   "And then I realized that I couldn't beat you guys
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.400]   "at the end of the day.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.480]   "So I just stopped trying."
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.240]   I mean, that's what we love to hear
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   when people really realize the utility of the service.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   - Yeah, do you actually need to have
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.960]   all those discounts in advance?
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.880]   Or could I say, "Hey, search the Costco rate
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.020]   "or the AAA rate.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.960]   "And if you happen to save me $300 on a rental
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.360]   "over the course of a week,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.400]   "it's worth it to just go sign up for AAA
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.680]   "or sign up for a Costco membership."
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.560]   - Yeah, AAA is a no brainer.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.000]   I mean, AAA is very inexpensive
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.160]   and sometimes the rate can be cut in half, literally.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.640]   Costco is, I would say, a close number two.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.120]   Costco has some great deals
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.120]   with some of the major rental car companies.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.040]   The interesting thing though,
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.460]   is that Costco works with certain companies
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.040]   and AAA works with other companies.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.960]   So for example, AAA currently works with Dollar Thrifty
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.720]   and Hertz, all part of the Hertz organization.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.240]   Whereas Costco Travel works with Enterprise,
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.440]   Alamo, Avis, and Budget.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.240]   So it may turn out that the AAA discount is great,
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.880]   but Hertz has a much better deal through AAA
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.720]   or another discount.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.980]   So you really wanna cast a wide net and check both,
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.320]   and as well as check other discounts
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.400]   that you may be eligible for,
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.880]   because you just never know
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.540]   where you're gonna find the best deal.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.480]   Especially these days, availability can be pretty tight.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.960]   So if you're looking for a minivan or a full-size SUV,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.680]   it may turn out that only one company
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.200]   that Costco Travel works with has a full-size SUV
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.800]   and the price is exorbitantly high.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.200]   Whereas Hertz, Dollar Thrifty all have full-size SUVs
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.280]   and one of them turns out to be a much better deal.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.440]   So you really wanna do your homework there.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.120]   - I've talked to a lot of people recently
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.400]   who historically have used their employer codes
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.880]   and then maybe they don't work at that company anymore.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   They keep using them.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.480]   Maybe they wanna search online for them
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.080]   and they've been kind of, at least in the recent past,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.320]   getting kind of called out and it's like,
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.960]   "Hey, can you show us that you work here?"
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.060]   And they get in trouble.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.360]   Is that something that's changing
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.100]   or how have you seen people handle those situations
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.840]   or is it even worth the risk?
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.520]   - It's absolutely changing.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.140]   Here in New York City where I live,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.440]   Avis has got this big honking sign
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.920]   right in the front of their rental desk over there
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.120]   that says you will absolutely need to show
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.920]   some form of proof of employment
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.320]   if you're using a corporate discount code.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.960]   I know a few folks who have gotten called out on that
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.160]   and ended up having to pay like five times the rate
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.880]   because they couldn't show proof of employment.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.920]   In fact, Avis and Budget, I believe both,
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.020]   they actually have warning on their website now.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.640]   When you put in a corporate discount code,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.000]   it warns you that you will be required to show proof
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.720]   and they will send you follow-up emails as well.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.480]   Back in the days when rental car rates were $20, $30 a day
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.080]   and the corporate rate was maybe $15 a day,
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.320]   they were just happy for the business.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.020]   But now it's a significant difference.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.320]   Rental car rates can be $125 a day
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.880]   and you've got some corporate discount code
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.480]   that knocks it down to a rock bottom price.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.640]   The rental car companies realize
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.380]   how much they're leaving on the table
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.000]   and they're very sensitive to that
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.680]   and they're telling their staff specifically,
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.160]   hey, enforce these rules,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.680]   make sure that people are not taking advantage of the system.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.000]   So people are getting called out,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.620]   they are running into issues,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.520]   they're either being denied or they're being forced to pay
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.220]   the walk-up rate, which can be fairly significant.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.500]   So is it worth it?
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.280]   Everyone's gotta make their own calculation.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   Obviously, if you're renting at an airport
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.320]   where you can skip the rental car counter,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.900]   there often is less scrutiny, but that's not a guarantee
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.720]   that they're not gonna check the exit booth
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.360]   or something like that.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.840]   Rental car companies do have security departments.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.600]   They have been known to put renters on the do not rent list
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.280]   for fraudulently using codes that they're not eligible for.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.080]   But it's a personal decision at the end of the day, I feel.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.280]   I mean, we never use corporate discount codes.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.680]   We're only using discount codes
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.920]   that are available to the general public.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.660]   But I certainly will acknowledge
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.880]   that you can save a significant amount of money.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.160]   Ideally, you'd use a corporate discount code
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.360]   that you're eligible for,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.920]   but there are lots of folks out there
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.480]   who will just search random websites and plug codes in.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.440]   And there is an element of risk to that.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.700]   - Yep, I haven't taken on that risk since leaving Google,
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.600]   but the Google rate was so good.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.040]   And I even still have my badge.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.480]   And I'm like, ah, maybe it's worth it, but I'm not sure.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.120]   I also know the Google rate included car insurance,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.920]   like it included the coverage.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.320]   And my understanding is that somebody,
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.000]   maybe even Google's picking up that bill,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.040]   and that if you were in an accident, it could be a problem.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.680]   Is that also true?
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.720]   - Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.440]   You know, there are corporate rates
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.520]   that include a collision damage waiver
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.200]   and liability in many cases.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.280]   And everything is, you know, hunky dory
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.320]   until you go along and you get into an accident.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.600]   And then all of a sudden, you know,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.280]   the corporation gets a report and says, you know,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.560]   this former employee or this person who was never an employee
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.240]   made a claim against the, and they're asking the,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   you know, Hertz is asking the company to, you know,
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.200]   kind of like foot a large bill
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.840]   and people start to investigate.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.560]   And that's where you can get up front in some trouble.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.840]   So, you know, if you're gonna use a corporate discount code,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.600]   certainly don't use one that includes insurance
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.240]   because you can't rely on the insurance paying out
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.080]   if you have an accident.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.120]   You're kind of playing with fire there.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.880]   - I wanna get to insurance, but you mentioned earlier
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.200]   that the time you pick up actually matters.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.760]   How does that, what if you find a better rate
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.440]   two hours before you land,
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.240]   but you know, you're not gonna be there?
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.920]   How much does when you book the time matter?
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.960]   - No, time can matter significantly.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.560]   There's a lot of different dynamics to this.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.000]   So I don't wanna get too far in the weeds,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.320]   but I'll bring up a couple of different scenarios.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.600]   There are different rate plans.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.200]   So for example, there are weekend rates
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.960]   where if you pick up after like 3 p.m. on Thursday
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.480]   and drop off before, you know, noon on Monday,
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.800]   you'll be on a weekend rate plan.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.840]   Whereas if you're picking up earlier than that,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.760]   you're on what's called a weekly rate plan
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.240]   or daily rate plan.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.760]   A lot of times when you're on the border
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.360]   between these daily, weekly, monthly rates,
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.480]   the rates can change significantly,
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.080]   sometimes much higher, sometimes much lower.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.200]   So it always pays to play around a little bit.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.240]   We recommend that people try adding a day,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.600]   subtracting a day.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.160]   You know, if you have flexibility,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.280]   it's always worth playing around with the dates a little bit,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.960]   especially if you're not picking up at an airport,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.320]   those, you know, your arrival and departure times
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.240]   are not fixed.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.360]   Even playing with the pickup time by a half an hour.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   We noticed a few years back
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.440]   that certain rental car companies were offering lower rates
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.480]   if you picked up on the half an hour instead of on the hour.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.600]   And that goes back to the rental car companies
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.800]   gaming each other.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.840]   There are automated rate shopping systems out there.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.520]   There's actually a company called Rate Highway
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   that many rental car companies use,
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.680]   or they had their own internal departments to do this.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.960]   And what they do is they're constantly reshopping
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.240]   each other's rates.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.920]   And they will go and they will check to see,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.360]   like Hertz will check to see what Enterprise has
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.960]   for a one week rental picking up at LAX.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.840]   And if Enterprise is priced at like $300 a week,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.560]   Hertz will price it at 290 a week.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.200]   And then Enterprise will recheck Hertz
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.280]   and realize it's 290 and Enterprise will be 285.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.320]   And it's sort of a game of leapfrog.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.240]   And sometimes it's a race to the bottom.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.160]   And we actually will see rates fluctuate
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   quite substantially.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.000]   And I was shocked when I first got into this industry,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.440]   I built like a proof of concept tool
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.880]   to see how well AutoSlash would perform.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.760]   We knew that there was some rate volatility
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.720]   and my business partner said,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.760]   but how much rate volatility actually is there?
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.480]   And I said, I'm not really sure.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.080]   I said, well, why don't we try to build a tool
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.920]   and test that out?
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.720]   And I was shocked the rates were all over the place.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.240]   And I thought the tool was broken.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.280]   So I actually went and repriced everything by hand
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.360]   and plugged it into Excel.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.720]   And I didn't really understand why rates were all over.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.800]   And it took me until a few years later to really understand
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   that the rental car companies
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.640]   are very competitive with each other.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.720]   And there are basically three major rental car companies.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.040]   You've got Hertz, which owns Dollar Thrifty.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.760]   You've got Enterprise, which owns Alamo National.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.320]   And then you've got Avis, which owns Budget and Payless.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.360]   And each of these three companies has various brands
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.280]   that they're positioning at different segments,
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.240]   different price points in the market.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.080]   But that said, they're all competing with one another
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.880]   and sometimes even intra-brand.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.600]   And if you can recheck prices frequently,
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.400]   that's something that you can use to your advantage.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.480]   And with the rental car companies reshopping each other,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.720]   they're trying to get one over on each other.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.040]   They're trying to get a leg up
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.280]   in terms of being able to steer
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.000]   a little bit more business their way.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.920]   And that sometimes means playing around
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.040]   with the pickup times, the drop-off times,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.600]   the vehicle types.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.440]   There's a lot of ways that the rental car companies
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.000]   kind of game things in order to pull in more business.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.560]   And the savvy renter can use that to their advantage
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.600]   in order to try to find a better deal.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.960]   - So let's say you find a rate that's 30 minutes earlier
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.160]   or two hours earlier, and you don't show up on time.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.920]   Is it okay if you show up that day,
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.160]   but it's not the exact time you booked it?
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.360]   - Right, so if you book with the major rental car companies,
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.920]   the big three or the nine brands that comprise the big three,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.120]   you can pretty much show up anytime you want that day.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.000]   So if you have booked a reservation
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   for a 12 o'clock pickup, you can show up at 7 p.m.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.440]   and no one's gonna say boo about it.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.200]   In fact, you can show up for a 12 o'clock reservation
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.520]   at 9 a.m. and they're not gonna say,
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.000]   "Oh, wait, we have to get your car ready for you."
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.280]   There's no getting your car ready.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.320]   You show up and they give you one of 100 cars
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.000]   that are sitting on the lot.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.640]   It's not like when you make the reservation,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.000]   they put this car aside for Chris.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.280]   Chris wants an intermediate car.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.040]   Okay, this Toyota Corolla over here is gonna be for Chris.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.160]   No, it's like you show up and go grab whatever you want.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.920]   I mean, if it's National or Alamo
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.480]   or even Hertz Ultimate Choice,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.680]   they just let you loose in the lot
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.720]   and you grab whatever's there.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.400]   And maybe there's no midsize cars there.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.680]   So they say, "Oh, grab a full size."
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.400]   It's a very loosey-goosey type system,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.760]   which is good for renters
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.480]   because it means there's a lot of flexibility
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.440]   in terms of what you can do.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.840]   But it also means that in some cases,
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.920]   there's overbooking situations that,
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.080]   we can talk about that later.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.080]   But specifically with regard to pickup and drop-off times,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.720]   within 24 hours, you have a lot of flexibility
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.440]   in terms of when you can pick up.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.760]   The discount brands, they're not quite as flexible.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.960]   There may be like a two-hour window or a three-hour window.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.040]   And outside the U.S., it can be different as well.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.600]   But if we're talking about renting in the U.S. or Canada
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.560]   with the major companies,
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.040]   you can show up anytime you want.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.680]   And if you happen to show up earlier than your reservation,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.640]   you can pick up the car.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.720]   You just have to keep in mind
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.680]   that rentals are priced on a 24-hour day.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.400]   So if you're picking up at 3 p.m.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.840]   and dropping off at 3 p.m. three days later,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.960]   and then you arrive five hours early,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.200]   well, you're probably gonna end up paying
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.120]   for an extra day there.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.720]   So that can come into play.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   - Are there any brands that,
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.840]   if you need to drop the car off a couple hours late,
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.920]   are better than others?
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.520]   I know sometimes I've needed a car for like 26 hours,
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.680]   and I'm like, "God, is there a way to avoid
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.520]   "having to pay for two days?"
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.280]   - So the general rule of thumb is that
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.080]   the first hour, you're gonna pay a third of the daily rate.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.760]   The second hour, you're gonna pay
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.400]   two-thirds of the daily rate.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.240]   And by the third hour,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   you're basically paying for an entire extra day.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.640]   There is a little bit of variability
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.120]   between rental car company and location,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.880]   but that's the general rule of thumb
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.680]   in terms of how they price it out.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.200]   - Is there any grace period at all?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   Like, I know Hertz sometimes gives you
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.320]   like 59 minutes free or something.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.000]   - 29 minutes is the grace period for pretty much all.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.160]   So as soon as you hit that 30-minute mark,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.040]   they're adding extra charges.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.560]   So if you can get there within 29 minutes of your,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.240]   and remember, it's not your scheduled return time,
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.880]   it's 29 minutes from the time you picked up.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.040]   So if you're scheduled to pick up at 3 p.m.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.920]   and scheduled to return at 3 p.m.,
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.720]   but you picked up at 2.45 p.m.,
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.800]   well, you just cut 15 minutes off of your grace period.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.560]   So you've gotta make sure that
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.160]   it's related to when you picked up.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.320]   And likewise, if you picked up a half an hour later
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.240]   than your scheduled time,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.480]   well, you've got an extra half an hour buffer there,
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.120]   plus the 29 minute grace period.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.040]   So definitely pay attention to
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.560]   not necessarily what you booked,
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.320]   but what the checkout time is on your rental car contract.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.760]   - And do any of the discount programs,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.720]   whether it's USAA or AAA or anything,
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.880]   include extra grace periods?
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.200]   - So the Amex Platinum CDP,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.920]   Amex Platinum Discount Code with Hertz,
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.480]   includes a four-hour grace period.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.840]   But it's important to remember that
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.400]   that's priced in to the rental when you book it.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.680]   So for example, if you book a three-day and four-hour rental,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.320]   you're only paying for three days.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.000]   It doesn't mean that you can book a three-day
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.880]   and four-hour rental and then show up three days
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.200]   and eight hours later and think that you're,
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.840]   oh, okay, my scheduled return time is,
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.160]   it's not 12 p.m., it's 4 p.m., but you show up at 7.30.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.880]   Well, you've already used the grace period
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.240]   in terms of how they priced it in the original booking.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   So, but that's how it works.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.280]   You can, and that can save you a significant amount of money
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.400]   because oftentimes, if you're kind of ending up
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.360]   in an extra day, or even if you're renting
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.800]   on a weekend rental and it kind of throws you
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.920]   into a weekly rental with that extra four hours,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.440]   by using the Amex Platinum CDP,
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.400]   that can make a huge difference in terms of what the rate is
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.240]   when you're on those borders between different rate types.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.360]   - And will you guys, is that one of the options
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.400]   when I'm searching on AutoSlash?
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.680]   - It is, yep. - Cool.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.720]   And then last one on the rate times,
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.160]   is it ever cheaper to add,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.360]   like let's say I'm renting for six days,
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.800]   is it ever cheaper to add a seventh and make it a week?
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.400]   Or how does the weekly rental rate work?
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.000]   - Absolutely, but it's usually not six to seven.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.640]   It's usually renting from like between four and five days.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.680]   So typically, anything five days or greater
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.640]   is considered a weekly rental in rental car industry,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.680]   but it's slightly more granular than that.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.720]   Anything above, remember we said earlier
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.000]   that if you return three hours late, then it's an extra day.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.080]   So really anything that's four days and three hours
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.440]   or greater is basically means you're renting for five days
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   and that's throws you into a weekly rate.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   So for example, a four day and two hour rental
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.720]   is essentially a daily rental rate,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.480]   but four days and six hours is a weekly rental.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   So that's something where you definitely wanna try
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.080]   to add a little bit of time or add an extra day or so
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.320]   and price it out because it can make a significant difference.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.160]   - That's great.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.920]   We jumped into a bunch of different areas,
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.680]   but you talked about the three major brands.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.880]   I'm curious, two questions.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.760]   One, how do they stack up?
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.840]   Like I know what the difference is between flying on Spirit
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.480]   and flying on virtually any other airline.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.640]   What is the difference?
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.320]   Yeah, I know, it's not something I wanna experience again,
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.480]   but what's the difference
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.440]   between these different rental car brands?
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   Like what makes a four or five star brand
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.560]   versus a two star brand?
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.440]   I know you guys rate them on the site,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.640]   but I don't know if I totally understand
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.600]   what would change my experience.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.560]   - Well, from our perspective,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.680]   National really sets the standard.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.120]   Far and away, National is the best experience,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.480]   both from the perspective of being able
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.720]   to choose your own vehicle in the Emerald Isle,
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.480]   as well as just an overall service perspective.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.420]   I tend to run for National when I can,
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.520]   when it's a good deal.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.760]   I find that National's vehicle selection is the best.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.720]   I find that they have late model cars.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.440]   I find that overall, it's generally a non-event,
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.880]   which is exactly what you want when you're renting a car.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.520]   I would say that Hertz follows closely behind.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.640]   Hertz was not great
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.440]   until they introduced Hertz Ultimate Choice.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.840]   Hertz Ultimate Choice is available
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.340]   at all the major airport locations
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.720]   that basically lets you choose your own vehicle,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.620]   similar to the way that National does it.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.120]   It's not quite as good as National's offering,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.200]   but it is quite convenient
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.120]   and you'll get on your way fairly quickly.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.500]   And I would say Avis comes in a close third,
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.960]   but Avis doesn't have a similar offering
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.320]   in terms of picking your own vehicle.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.240]   So typically they're assigning you a vehicle.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.400]   They have something similar where you can choose it
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.180]   in the app, but it never quite works seamlessly.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.720]   So that's something that I think Avis
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.400]   could definitely put some work into
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.260]   and develop a similar service.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.840]   Rounding out the next tier down,
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.920]   I would say that Alamo and Budget are pretty comparable.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.680]   I'm pretty happy with Alamo.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.080]   Alamo is similar to National.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.800]   They let you choose your own vehicle.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.600]   So for example, if you reserved a standard SUV,
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.880]   they'll send you out to the lot
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.940]   and there'll be a row of 50 standard SUVs
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.800]   and you can go choose from those.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.260]   Got pretty convenient kiosks
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.360]   where you can just go check in.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.760]   You don't have to wait out line.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.740]   That makes it convenient.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.860]   Budget offers what they call fast break service,
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.860]   which will either a separate line
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.240]   or you can go directly to the rental car lot
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.600]   so that'll get you on your way quicker.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.120]   But it's not quite as seamless
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.120]   as the major companies, as far as Hertz and National.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.360]   And then you've got Dollar, Thrifty, Payless.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.960]   These are the more deep discount brands.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.560]   The savings can be significant there.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.380]   Some of them do offer express service
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.340]   to let you get on your way more quickly,
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.040]   but the vehicles tend not to be as low mileage
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.540]   and as recent vintage.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.880]   And the service levels tend to be a little bit longer.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.680]   And waiting on line can also be a significant issue.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.280]   Theoretically, you can take advantage
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.000]   of these loyalty programs.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.320]   Dollar has express service.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.760]   Thrifty has blue chip.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.880]   Budget has fast break,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.960]   but they're not quite as consistent
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.360]   as some of the major companies are
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.560]   in terms of getting you on your way quickly.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.720]   You can wait on line in many cases.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.640]   - So is it safe to say the more premium brand you rent with,
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.960]   the primary benefit is being able to pick your own car
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.320]   and being able to skip the line?
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.480]   Are there other benefits to think about?
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.600]   - Yeah, that's correct.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.080]   Other benefits include earning points
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.600]   or credits for free days.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.360]   National has one of the best programs out there
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   in terms of getting rental car credits
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.640]   and earning free days.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.560]   They also have a program called One-Two Free,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.720]   which means that if you have two completed rentals,
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.520]   you can get a third day for free,
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.480]   which is pretty generous.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.280]   Hertz has devalued their program
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.920]   many times over the years.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.240]   Davis's program, they do offer points,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.960]   but those points are not worth a whole lot.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.280]   In many cases, you can do better
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.880]   by crediting your rentals to frequent flyer programs
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.440]   and hotel programs and that sort of thing.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.880]   So I would say that the upgrades are significant
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.680]   in terms of being able to choose your own vehicle.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.160]   You can reserve a mid-sized car
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.000]   and oftentimes drive away in a full-size or premium car,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.840]   even an SUV.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.600]   But being able to skip the counter from my perspective
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.360]   is number one, because during COVID, you see these lines,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.800]   there can be 20, 30, 50 people waiting on line
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.320]   and it can be two hours to get a car.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.160]   Time is money.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.960]   I don't really wanna be standing around in an airport
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.200]   waiting to get my vehicle.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.080]   And it's really nice to be able to walk
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.160]   into the Atlanta Car Rental Center
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.320]   and see a line of 50 people walk right past them,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.720]   walk to the lot, jump in a car, speed off.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.440]   And before these guys even move one line placement,
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.640]   you're already in the exit booth and on your way.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.680]   So it's nice.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.760]   It's something that we recommend
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.840]   to all of our customers doing.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.160]   It's a no-brainer.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.200]   Your rental car programs are free to sign up for.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.720]   I'm not really sure why anyone would not do it,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.240]   but people can sometimes,
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.760]   they don't think about it ahead of time
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.200]   and then they end up paying for it, fortunately.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.600]   - And what about the loyalty programs
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.240]   with kind of status that you can earn,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.120]   whether it's by renting a lot or through a credit card,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.080]   do the status loyalty programs do much?
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.760]   - The status programs will get you better vehicles.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.800]   In some cases, National's executive program
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.920]   is pretty good.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.480]   You definitely have nicer vehicles
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.440]   in the executive section.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.240]   Hertz has the President's Circle option.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.360]   So for example, if you're a Capital One Venture X
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:49.000]   cardholder, you'll get upgraded to Hertz President's Circle.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.760]   If you're a Visa Infinite cardholder,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.560]   you can get National Emerald Club Executive.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.480]   It does make a difference.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.800]   And as far as these credit cards,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.440]   it may be cards that you already have in your wallet already.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.720]   So it is a no brainer just to upgrade your status
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   or sign up if you're not already a member
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.040]   and get that status.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.800]   And they will also match status membership.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.720]   So you can email them and you can show proof of a status
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.920]   with at least status of one company.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.560]   And they oftentimes will upgrade you
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.880]   and then you can use that status upgrade to a third company.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.720]   So it is pretty easy to do.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.960]   The rental car companies,
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.400]   the status doesn't cost them anything.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.000]   They want you to rent from them.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.800]   They feel like, okay,
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.880]   if we give you Emerald Club Executive status,
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.360]   you're more likely to rent from us
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.760]   because you think you're gonna get a better vehicle.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.960]   And in fact, you are.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.600]   So they would rather have a lot of elite members
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.800]   and get a lot more business
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.320]   than being stingy with the statuses.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.600]   - So when you skip the line,
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.200]   you go out to the lot, you see 30, 40 cars.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.040]   I always struggle.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.880]   I'm looking here, I'm like,
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   I don't know anything about these brands.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.280]   How do you decide which of the nine different
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.360]   mid-size or intermediate or full-size cars to pick from?
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.720]   Is there some rule of thumb?
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.120]   How do you pick a car?
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.680]   - You know, I've got my own personal preferences.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.840]   I mean, if I see a BMW or Mercedes there,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.440]   you know, I'm probably making a beeline for that.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.120]   I enjoy driving SUVs more than I do sedans.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.560]   So, you know, that's definitely something I'm looking for.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.000]   Jeeps are always nice.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.960]   Some people don't like the driving, but I enjoy them.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.280]   Sometimes you see convertibles
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.800]   in ultimate choice and executive area.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.440]   But, you know, if you've got a lot of similar vehicles,
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.000]   a lot of times, you know, you walk out there
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.600]   and it's a sea of Camrys or a sea of Ultimas,
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.480]   and they all kind of look similar.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.040]   A lot of times I'll open up the door,
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.600]   I'll look at the mileage.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   It's not always easy to tell from the outside
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.880]   which ones have, you know, 3,000 miles on it
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.640]   versus 33,000 miles on it.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.040]   So I'll look at that.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.120]   Oftentimes I'll also look at the tires.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.560]   You can tell very quickly how much wear a car has
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.200]   by how much tread is left in the tires.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.040]   And in fact, even in a dark lot,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.320]   I don't even need to look at it.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.360]   I can actually take my hand
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.240]   and I can kind of put my fingers in there
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.440]   and I can see how much tread is left in the tire,
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.320]   especially if I'm driving in an area
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.240]   where it's going to be raining or snowy.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.320]   You definitely want to make sure
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.600]   that you drive out of the lot
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.320]   with something that has a lot of tread on it.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.920]   You don't want to have ball tires
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.320]   and go skidding across the highway.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.520]   So it's definitely something I consider,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.240]   especially in bad weather.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.040]   And then the other thing is just, you know,
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.400]   in terms of amenities,
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.680]   some of these vehicles are better outfitted
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.280]   in terms of their entertainment systems.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   Do they have Bluetooth?
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.040]   Can I pair my phone to it?
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   Do they have an AUX port if I want to plug in,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.960]   you know, my phone or something else?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.560]   So it's a lot of times a matter of personal preference,
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.000]   but I would say go for the low mileage vehicles
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.840]   and go for something that, you know,
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.200]   has the amenities that you'd like to be driving.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.560]   - Yeah, I think sometimes I forget
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.840]   that you can just open the door and look,
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.120]   is there a little Bluetooth sticker?
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.760]   Is there a USB charging port?
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.600]   All those kinds of things.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.560]   So like, that's a great tip.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.040]   What do you think of the kind of
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.720]   non-traditional rental car companies,
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.800]   maybe the Silvercar, the Turo,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.200]   or things that kind of don't usually show up in the search,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.080]   but have a different experience?
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.800]   - Well, you mentioned Silvercar first.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.440]   Silvercar was a good idea.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.840]   I liked them.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.000]   I liked them much more when they were at convenient airports
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.600]   and now they've sort of been banished
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.400]   to Audi dealerships in many cases in far flung areas.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.160]   I don't really see Silvercar as being something
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   that's gonna be relevant in the future.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.320]   I think that they're sort of a backwater at this point.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.360]   You know, they still exist
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.720]   and it's great for dealership rentals
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.000]   if you live close to a dealership,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.280]   but you're not gonna be landing at an airport
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.240]   and then running over to the Silvercar dealership
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.000]   in most cases just because they're not that convenient.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.560]   Turo is a good option.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.880]   You can get a better deal.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.160]   I think that people sometimes, you know,
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.560]   have one experience and they say,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.160]   oh, you know, I rented from Turo and it was great
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.880]   or it was terrible or I got a great deal
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.080]   and I'll never rent from another,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.480]   the major rental car companies again.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.080]   But, you know, the reality is that you need to always check
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.600]   and see what the availability and what the pricing is.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.080]   I mean, on one hand, Turo could be way less
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.280]   than renting from a traditional car rental company.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.280]   In other cases, it could end up being a lot more,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.560]   but you also have some risk with Turo as well.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.360]   And this is, we saw this a lot with COVID,
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.160]   especially in Hawaii where people were renting
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.960]   from Turo hosts, as they call them,
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   and the host was canceling on them
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.160]   either at the last minute,
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.800]   meaning the day that they're flying in or within a week.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.680]   And because the Turo host realized
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.400]   that they could get a lot more money for their car
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.640]   when rental car prices were, you know,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.560]   streaking into the stratosphere,
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.240]   these Turo hosts who had, you know,
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.080]   rented the car for let's say 40 bucks a day
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   had sellers remorse and realized they could rent the car
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.480]   for $90 a day.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.720]   So they would just cancel on the existing renter
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   and say, sorry, car wasn't available.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.840]   And then the renter would be stuck
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.480]   and then there would be nothing available
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.120]   through the traditional rental car companies
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.080]   or prices would be much higher.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.880]   So it's something that you do need to take into account.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.040]   It can be convenient.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.520]   Sometimes the Turo hosts are willing to drop off cars
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.880]   at airports or at different locations.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.680]   Other times you've got to, you know,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.040]   wait around for them and, you know,
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.680]   maybe they're a little late in arriving.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.240]   So, you know, it's not right for everyone,
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.480]   but it can be a good deal in certain cases.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.880]   So it's worth shopping around,
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.440]   but it's definitely a little bit more effort.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   You're not gonna, you know, land at the airport,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.240]   jump on the shuttle bus and be on your way.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.680]   And, you know, in two minutes,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.240]   like you would with some of the more convenient
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.560]   airport rental car companies.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.200]   Another one that we really like
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.520]   that we started to work with recently
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.480]   at Auto Slash is called Kite, K-Y-T-E.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.760]   And Kite's got a pretty awesome model.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.400]   They will drop off the car at your home or business to you.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.720]   They call them Kite surfers.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.400]   They're basically gig workers
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.960]   and they will bring the car from a nearby lot
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.880]   and they'll drop it off.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.960]   I use them here in New York City all the time.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.400]   I schedule a drop off for let's say 10 a.m.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.440]   someone shows up in front of my apartment building
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.920]   with the car.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.640]   I quickly show them my driver's license.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.800]   I sign on my phone and then I just drive off.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.680]   And then I schedule the return for whenever I want.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.640]   Someone will be here to pick up the car again.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.920]   There's no rental office.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.000]   I don't, I never wait on line.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.040]   Super convenient.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.920]   They fill up the tank at market rate.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.040]   They charge you for the actual price of the tolls.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.160]   You really don't have to do anything.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.360]   It's just kind of a no brainer.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.240]   So it's a really convenient service.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.000]   I believe they're in 13 cities right now.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.840]   Primarily operate off airport,
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.440]   but I believe at LAX in San Francisco,
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.880]   they have some options for a nearby lot
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.640]   where you can pick up the car from them
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.800]   where they stage those cars.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.480]   So I think it's a company that is new,
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.840]   but I expect some pretty significant things
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.680]   for them in the future.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.600]   So worth checking out.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.440]   - What do you think about when you're booking,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.960]   and I don't know if this shows up on auto slash,
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.800]   but sometimes it's like,
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.320]   we're not gonna tell you which company this is,
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.600]   but the rate's better.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.760]   - Yeah, so those are called,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.880]   are known as what's called opaque rentals.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.200]   And basically those come with significant penalties
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.760]   in terms of cancellation.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.720]   Actually, they come with the penalty of no cancellation.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.360]   Essentially you pay them and they tell you
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.760]   which rental car company it is after your book,
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.040]   and then you are not allowed to cancel
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.480]   or refund your reservation
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.640]   or change it even under any circumstances.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.600]   So if you're absolutely 100% sure
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.840]   that you're gonna be going on the trip
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.960]   and you're gonna need that rental car,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.480]   it can be a good deal.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.120]   If you're happy with all the choices at the bottom tier,
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.800]   you know, it may be like Fox, Payless, Advantage.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.640]   If you're not happy with one of those three companies,
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.960]   then don't rent from them because in Murphy's law,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.120]   you're probably gonna end up with a company
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.840]   that you don't like.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.360]   I have less of an issue if it's, you know,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.800]   one of the top tier companies,
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.320]   it could be Avis, National or Hertz.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.960]   Or for example, sometimes the tier is Dollar Thrifty
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.200]   or Alamo, you know, all decent companies,
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.280]   you can save a significant amount of money in some cases.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.320]   But then again, you can also check AutoSlash first.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.480]   And it may turn out that just because it's an opaque deal
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.160]   that is better than the rack rate,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.680]   AutoSlash may be able to find you a AAA discount rate
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.960]   or Costco and the price ends up being better.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.560]   So, you know, they have their place.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.160]   We tend to shy away from them,
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.520]   but especially booking last minute where, you know,
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.720]   it's unlikely that you'll be able to find a better deal
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.640]   by repricing it, you know, for another few days.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.120]   It could be worthwhile.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.000]   But the important thing to remember with those rentals
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.480]   is that you cannot skip the counter.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.880]   You have to go to the rental car company.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.640]   So if you show up and there's 50 people online,
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.920]   there's no way to skip.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.240]   You're not gonna earn loyalty points.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.280]   You're not gonna get upgrades.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.680]   You're not gonna be able to choose your own car.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.840]   So it's more of a, you know,
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.800]   of a deep discount leisure type rental.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.320]   And you have to understand
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.840]   what you're getting yourself into if you take that deal.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.360]   - There's one other kind of rental car company
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.720]   that I don't know if I understand.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.320]   And maybe it's unique to LAX,
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.760]   but I was helping our au pair try to book a car in LA.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.160]   And I found all these random rental car companies
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.320]   that had some kind of search on their website,
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.920]   but when you book, it almost seemed like
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.480]   you were just kind of submitting a form online.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.800]   And I wish I knew the names of them,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.360]   but they seem to have rental cars.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.800]   They seem to have competitive prices,
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.640]   but I just kind of felt like I was filling out a web form
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.880]   and I had no conviction that the car would actually show up
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.400]   or that the company even existed.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.440]   Have you seen any of these?
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.280]   Are they real?
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.800]   Are they trustworthy?
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.840]   - Well, you're right to worry.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.640]   I think that typically these are broker websites
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.760]   and what they're doing is they're taking your request
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.600]   and they're farming it out
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.920]   to a bunch of little small mom and pop type
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.240]   rental car companies around the LAX area.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.640]   And then they're sending you quotes.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.560]   Those quotes may be significantly less
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.480]   than what you can get with the major companies,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   but they also come with some significant caveats
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.800]   in terms of you may end up getting a vehicle
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.680]   that's much higher mileage, much older.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.920]   The service levels are not gonna be great.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.520]   You may end up being on the hard sell in terms of insurance.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.160]   They may force you to take insurance
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.000]   even if you already have insurance
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.360]   through, for example, your credit card
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.240]   or your personal auto insurance policy.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.520]   So these are sort of the bottom feeders
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.440]   in the rental car industry.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.320]   It's something that we definitely tell people
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.880]   to shy away from.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.440]   There really isn't, in this day and age,
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.480]   any reason why you can't get an instant price
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.960]   and rent with a company that is reputable.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.280]   I'm not saying that these companies are not reputable,
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.240]   but in some cases, they're all small shops
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.320]   that may have significant issues.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.960]   So you have to be very careful.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.040]   If you look at the Better Business Bureau ratings
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.400]   and the consumer boards,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.520]   you'll find that some of these companies are very uneven
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.360]   and it's hard to know exactly who you're renting from
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.600]   because they change names, they move around.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.080]   One company represents another.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.440]   You think you're renting with company A,
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.280]   but it's actually being serviced by company B.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.920]   So there can be issues with those.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.040]   - Okay, so let's talk about, you get to the airport.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.800]   You know, one thing that I think COVID has left
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.840]   as a fear in my mind,
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.040]   and maybe you'll say the fear is gone,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:38.960]   don't stop worrying about it,
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.880]   is that you show up and there's no car available.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.960]   Is that still a thing
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.880]   where car rental companies oversell their inventory
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.640]   and you show up and there's nothing there?
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.600]   - It is a thing.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.080]   I like to tell people that the vast majority of renters,
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.320]   the number of people who show up
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.440]   and they don't have a car available to them
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.200]   is a fraction of 1%.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.560]   That's a little consolation though
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.560]   when you are the 0.002% of the people that show up
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.160]   and all of a sudden the rental car company
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.120]   has mismanaged their inventory and they run out.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.440]   They do often oversell their inventory.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.120]   The no-show rate in the rental car industry
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.400]   can be upwards of 30%.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.920]   So they're going to oversell to a certain degree
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.560]   to try to get as close to 100% utilization as they can.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.680]   Usually it's not an issue.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.600]   Some companies are better than others with it,
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.960]   but it can happen.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.440]   Sometimes what you end up having to do
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.320]   is wait around until more cars come back.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.680]   We've seen situations where you have 20, 30 people online
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.600]   and no one's getting a car for two hours.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.080]   It does happen.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.120]   It's uncommon.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.160]   People sometimes ask me,
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.920]   well, should I book with multiple companies
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.080]   in order to increase my chance of getting a vehicle?
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.240]   That's a hard one to answer.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.000]   I hesitate because I don't want to exacerbate the problem
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.280]   in the industry and lots of people
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.640]   making multiple reservations
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.040]   that they're not going to show up for
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.000]   is really just compounding the problem.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.840]   But in some cases, if you have to be somewhere,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.360]   if you're traveling to a wedding
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.160]   and you're flying in two hours before the wedding starts
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.800]   and you just can't take any chances,
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   hey, a backup reservation
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.160]   might not be the worst thing in the world.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.320]   So it's one of those things
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.320]   where everyone's got to make a personal decision.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.920]   But I will say that it's not good for the industry
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.960]   if lots of people are booking
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.840]   and no showing all over the place.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:27.960]   - Is there anything you can do
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.360]   to guarantee you'll have a car,
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   call ahead, maybe prepay,
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.760]   have status with the rental car company?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.600]   - So first of all,
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.040]   prepaying doesn't really guarantee you anything.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.560]   It's not like someone who shows up
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.120]   with a pay later reservation,
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.040]   shows up and they have one car left
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.320]   and the rental car agent says,
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.600]   oh no, no, I'm sorry.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.160]   I have a Mr. Chris Hutchins coming in
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.440]   and he's got a prepaid reservation.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.520]   I'm putting this car aside for him.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.800]   It doesn't really work that way.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.680]   Whoever is first at the rental car counter,
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   if they've got vehicles,
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.520]   they're gonna give it to you.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.080]   So if you show up with a prepaid reservation,
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.160]   yeah, I mean, they need to get a car for you
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.000]   one way or another,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.640]   but it doesn't mean you wouldn't necessarily have to wait.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.040]   Status does make a difference
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.840]   and the ability to skip the counter makes a difference.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.440]   So even if you have just base status
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.320]   with the car rental company,
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.080]   if there's 20 people online
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.040]   and they've got three cars in the lot,
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.480]   hey, if you walk past that line
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.440]   and not have to wait for someone to service you,
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.920]   you can grab one of those three cars
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.440]   that are sitting in the executive aisle
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.120]   or ultimate choice or whatever and drive off.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.760]   And those people that are waiting online
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.960]   inside the rental car center,
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.040]   they're still waiting.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.080]   So, and higher status can help.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.120]   It's not a guarantee,
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.160]   but it's something that does make a difference.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.320]   Calling ahead can sometimes help.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.520]   If for no other reason
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.160]   than the rental car company can tell you that,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.280]   hey, we don't expect there'll be any problem.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.520]   We have lots of cars in the lot,
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.360]   or, hey, we're short on cars.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.000]   You may have to wait.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.160]   It would be better if you could show up
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.880]   a little bit earlier, that sort of thing.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.600]   So calling is not a bad idea,
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.920]   especially if you're renting at an off airport location
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.760]   because they typically have smaller fleets.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.840]   So the local staff can advise you what the situation is.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.880]   - And if you did show up and there was no cars,
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.000]   what would you do?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.040]   - The rental car company is obligated
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.480]   to find you a vehicle.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.520]   I mean, a rental car reservation is a binding contract,
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.640]   but that said, they can't make cars show up out of thin air.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.080]   In some cases, you're waiting around
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.160]   for other people to return vehicles.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.280]   In other cases, they may be able to move vehicles
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.200]   from another location,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.880]   or they may be able to send you to a nearby location.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.320]   Technically, the rental car company
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.440]   should pay for cab or Uber fare
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.200]   if you've got to go to a different location,
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.480]   or they should take some money off the rental.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.880]   Consumers, a lot of times the rental car company employees
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.520]   just don't want to deal with the situation.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.960]   They're like, sorry, we ran out of cars,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.400]   and there's nothing we can do.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.880]   I mean, that's true to some degree,
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.760]   but the reality is that the rental car company
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   has to provide you with a vehicle
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.400]   if you have a confirmed reservation,
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   and they really should do everything in their power
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.520]   to try to find you a vehicle.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.080]   The entire area sold out,
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.640]   you just can't get blood from a stone,
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.520]   but if a nearby location five miles away has a vehicle,
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.960]   they should be able to send you over there.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.000]   I mean, it's one of those cases
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.640]   where the squeaky wheel gets the grease,
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.920]   so we definitely recommend pushing the rental car staff
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.200]   and letting them know that, hey, I'm not leaving here.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.440]   I need a vehicle.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.120]   You need to come up with some sort of option,
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.440]   and that also includes if the rental car company
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.520]   doesn't have the vehicle you reserved.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.400]   Let's say you reserved a compact car,
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.120]   and they say, well, we have no compact cars.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:37.640]   All we have is this compact SUV or this minivan or whatever,
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.760]   and there'll be an upgrade charge for that.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.520]   Like, no, there's no upgrade charge.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.040]   Like, if you don't have the vehicle class that I reserved,
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.760]   you need to upgrade me to what you do have at no charge.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.640]   We see this sometimes with different locations,
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.680]   and we tell our customers, no, you should push back.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.400]   The rental car company is obligated to give you a vehicle,
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.640]   and if they can't provide the vehicle
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.040]   that you initially reserved,
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.760]   they should provide you a vehicle at the same cost,
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.560]   even if that is a significant upgrade
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.880]   for what you initially had booked.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.000]   - This happened to a friend of mine one time.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.520]   They got to the rental car counter, and they're like,
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.040]   oh, man, I got a free upgrade to a Suburban
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.080]   from what I thought would be like a Nissan Altima,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.920]   but I was like, well, gas prices are pretty expensive.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.840]   That just became a more expensive rental.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.440]   Do you think you could negotiate a discount
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.800]   in that circumstance, saying this is gonna cost me more
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.440]   because of the cost of fuel?
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.840]   - Absolutely, and in some cases,
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.000]   you can ask the rental car company
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.600]   to throw in a tank of gas,
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.080]   because prepaid fuel is one option
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.680]   that the rental car companies will offer you.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   It's never a good deal,
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   but it's something that you can say,
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.120]   hey, throw in a tank of gas,
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.000]   because this gas guzzler is not what I reserved,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.760]   and it's gonna cost me a lot more,
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.480]   so I'm willing to drive it around if that's all you have,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.000]   but it shouldn't be at my expense.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.760]   It should be at your expense.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.400]   Likewise, there's similar situations
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.360]   where you'll show up at the rental car desk,
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.520]   and they'll say, hey, you rented a compact car.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.960]   We can offer you a full-size car
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.840]   for only another $5 a day,
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.680]   but what they don't tell you
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.600]   is they don't have the compact car that you reserved.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.920]   They only have full-size cars,
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.680]   so if you push back and say,
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.080]   I'm not interested in upgrading,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.680]   or do you even have the compact car
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.120]   that you initially reserved,
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.080]   a lot of times they'll admit,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.320]   hey, we're at a compact car,
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.040]   so why would you pay an upgrade fee
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.280]   when they have to give it to you anyway?
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.240]   So that's another little hack
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.960]   that you should be aware of.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.240]   - And you just mentioned never pay for prepaid fuel.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.520]   I just wanna reiterate that,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.560]   'cause it came off pretty quick,
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.040]   'cause that sounds like it's never a deal,
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.360]   even if you know you're gonna need to drive a lot.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.360]   - Yeah, so the rental car companies
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:36.280]   will try to entice you to purchase prepaid tank of gas,
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.400]   but what you need to realize
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.520]   is that you're purchasing the entire tank of gas.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.040]   So if they say that this particular vehicle
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.320]   has a 18-gallon tank,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   they're charging you for 18 gallons
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.880]   at whatever their prevailing rate is,
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.040]   and they may say, well, we're giving it to you
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.840]   below the average price of the area,
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.240]   but remember that unless you use every drop
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.080]   of that 18 gallons,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.000]   and you drive back into the rental car lot on fumes,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.720]   you're basically leaving money on the table.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.400]   It's rare that you can time it
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.320]   so that you come back exactly empty.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.280]   And in many cases, you can do much better
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.560]   if you use something like GasBuddy,
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.560]   or even if you're a Costco member,
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.040]   you can get discounted gas there.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.840]   So it's something that, it's a convenient option,
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.800]   but it's definitely not the most cost-effective option.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.820]   We recommend that people fill up themselves,
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:25.600]   either on the way back to the rental car location,
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.080]   or if you've got an early morning flight,
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.440]   fill up the car the night before.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.040]   Generally, as long as you're within 10 miles or so
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.360]   at the airport, the car's still gonna register full
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.200]   when you roll into the location.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.480]   - Let's talk about the one other big thing
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.560]   people are always trying to sell you,
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.060]   which seems like insurance.
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.400]   I've always operated on the assumption,
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.000]   just use my credit card that includes
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.840]   primary rental coverage, decline everything.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.200]   Is that generally a good plan?
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.000]   - Yes, primary car rental credit cards,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.120]   primary car rental insurance cards
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.080]   are definitely the number one way
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.020]   to avoid the rental car company's pricey insurance.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.560]   What most people don't realize is that
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.200]   if you own your own car,
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.640]   you're almost certainly covered when renting,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.740]   and that includes for both collision and for liability.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:16.880]   Credit card insurance also will help.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.720]   In many cases, the non-premium cards
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.120]   provide secondary insurance,
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.680]   and that essentially means that the credit card
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:27.240]   will not pay out until your personal insurance
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.440]   pays out first.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.540]   But the premium cards typically include
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.720]   primary car rental insurance,
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.400]   which means you do not have to file a claim
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.160]   with your personal insurance company,
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.640]   and the credit card company insurance will pay out first.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.740]   And the better cards have excellent insurance.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:46.080]   There is really no reason to pay for the pricey insurance
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.880]   offered by the car rental companies.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:52.240]   That said, if you don't own your own vehicle,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.720]   it probably means you don't have liability insurance,
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.000]   and your credit card insurance,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.040]   while it will cover you for damage done to the rental car,
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.820]   it will not cover you for the accident that you had
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.480]   where your rear-ended a $90,000 Mercedes,
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.500]   and that insurance company is coming after you
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.440]   for the damage done to their vehicle,
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.960]   and/or if there were injuries
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.620]   to the other parties in the accident.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.600]   So you are taking a risk
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.160]   if you don't have liability insurance,
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.520]   and unfortunately, credit cards
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:23.000]   do not provide liability insurance.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.880]   It's rare that you find a third-party company
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.720]   that will provide it.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.280]   So that's something that you may have no choice but to take
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.720]   from the car rental company.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.720]   Otherwise, you're adding some risk to your own situation.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.000]   - So if you don't own a car,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.160]   you can still get the liability coverage from the rental car
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.400]   and decline the collision coverage, correct?
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.560]   - That is correct.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.120]   - And is there any policy if you're a frequent renter
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.080]   and you don't own a car?
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.220]   Is there like a non-owner car policy
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.160]   that'll cover you in other cars?
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.600]   - Sounds like you've done your research.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.440]   Yes, there are non-owner policies,
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.320]   and if you are a frequent renter,
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.080]   it's definitely something that's worth looking into.
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.800]   Non-owner policies will cover you
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.660]   for both collision and liability.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.200]   Typically, I would say that if you rent
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.840]   more than about five times a year,
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.920]   a non-owner policy can make a difference,
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.760]   and they will provide you with that coverage,
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.720]   the liability coverage and collision coverage.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.640]   And if your credit card has coverage,
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.320]   it will provide an extra layer on top of that as well.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.160]   - Yeah, I'll flag one thing.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.000]   I was looking at cars.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.680]   This is again for my au pair's trip,
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.580]   and she was going to California and Nevada.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.200]   And in Nevada, I believe all the rental cars
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.760]   come with some base liability coverage,
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.760]   which depending on your financial situation
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.000]   might just not be enough.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   And so I do wanna ask about excess liability.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.920]   Do you ever need more liability coverage
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.200]   than maybe what is included if it's mandated by a state?
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.000]   - It's important to remember that the rental car companies
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.880]   provide whatever the state mandated minimum is.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.920]   And in California, that's essentially zero.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.280]   California is somewhat unique in that regard,
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.440]   but even in other states
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.320]   where let's say it's $25,000 liability,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.840]   not only is it low,
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.920]   but it also doesn't stop the car rental company
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.840]   from coming after you.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.600]   So for example, if let's say you get into an accident
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.460]   and you total someone else's car,
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:13.840]   and then there's a claim against the liability insurance,
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.120]   that's the rental car company's liability insurance.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.080]   The rental car company owns the vehicle that is insured
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.280]   and they are the ones who are the beneficiary of it.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   So if there's nothing stopping Avis from coming after you
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.760]   and saying, "Hey, yeah, our liability policy
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.900]   "covered 25,000 of this $40,000 claim,
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.640]   "but we're gonna come after you for the entire amount
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.920]   "because you weren't the insured, we were the insured."
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.220]   So they could charge you
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.440]   for the entire amount of the claim there,
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.360]   or they could just charge you for the difference
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.520]   between what the insured amount was
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.400]   and what the overage is.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.900]   There's no guarantee,
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:53.120]   and you are not the primary beneficiary of that insurance.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.120]   Unlike if you take the policy from the car rental company,
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.320]   that typically will provide you
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.040]   with up to a million dollars in coverage.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.380]   That's a pretty standard amount.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.220]   - And what about,
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.320]   one thing I heard you talk about in the past
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   that I didn't quite grasp,
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.720]   if you book with points,
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.300]   then you're not actually putting the rental on your card.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.660]   So are you actually still covered
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.920]   even if you're paying the taxes
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.600]   by your credit card's coverage?
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.540]   - You know, there's a lot of debate online about this.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.960]   Well, you know, if you didn't pay
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.120]   for the entire amount of the rental on your card,
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.000]   then technically, you know, are you covered?
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.760]   We've never gotten a definitive answer from this.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.720]   The credit card companies don't typically,
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.000]   you know, wanna create a ruling, a precedent.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.960]   But by and large, what we found is that
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.800]   if you use the card for the deposit
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.140]   and there's some form of fee put on the card,
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.400]   even if it's just the taxes,
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.440]   the credit card company insurance will kick in.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.960]   The other thing that I sometimes recommend is,
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.780]   let's say you rent on points
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:49.380]   and it's like a three-day rental.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.520]   You could just, let's say you have an accident with the car,
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.760]   you could just return a day late
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.360]   and then that's gonna put some charge on the card.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.720]   Or let's say the card is total,
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.120]   what you could do is you could take some options,
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.340]   add satellite radio or add a prepaid, you know,
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.680]   tank of gas or something like that.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.960]   And I said, you know,
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.440]   previously don't take the prepaid fuel,
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.840]   but hey, if that's a way to, you know,
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.040]   on a points booking to add some sort of tangible amount
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:12.880]   onto the credit card
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.080]   so the rental car company can say,
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.520]   "Hey, you did put the rental on your credit card
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.840]   "in terms of a charge."
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.560]   That may be the difference between, you know,
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.100]   getting paid or not.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.740]   It's not something I really think about all that often
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.040]   in terms of, will my credit card cover me
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.600]   if I was on a points booking?
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.720]   But it can, you know, get into the legalese
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.400]   in terms of what's covered and what's not.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.640]   - What about, I know Amex has a rental car coverage,
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.920]   they actually cost money.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.120]   And I keep, I never understand why anyone would use that
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.680]   if assuming they had another card that included coverage.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.280]   Is there ever a use case where that makes sense?
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.400]   - You know, the Amex coverage is called Amex PCRP
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.040]   or Premium Car Rental Protection.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.380]   And the way it works is that you opt into it.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.780]   And anytime you rent,
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.240]   they're gonna charge your card for that amount.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.520]   It can be worthwhile
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.560]   if you have no other coverage available
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.560]   because it is primary insurance
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.140]   and they'll charge you per rental, not per day.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.920]   So it can work out well.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.120]   But that said, I mean,
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.200]   some of the better cards out there like the Chase Sapphire,
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.840]   the Chase Inc, United Mileage Plus Explorer,
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.460]   the ones that offer primary car rental protection,
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.920]   that coverage is as good or better
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.400]   than what Amex offers as a paid fee.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.320]   I personally use the Chase Inc cards when I'm renting.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.560]   I think it's excellent coverage
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.180]   and I've never had an issue with any claim being denied.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:37.180]   So that's something that I feel is easy to recommend
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:40.080]   and I would not recommend the Amex coverage,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.980]   especially 'cause there's an additional fee.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.080]   You're basically,
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.840]   you're getting a premium card to get those benefits.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.920]   Why not take advantage of those benefits?
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.100]   - What about all these extra fees?
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.560]   So I know if I've had an extra driver,
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.040]   there've been times in the past I've had to pay
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.880]   when I was younger than I think 25, I had to pay fees.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.680]   Are there any ways to get rid of those fees,
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.640]   avoid those fees, kind of get the rental down,
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.840]   even things like renting a car seat?
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.140]   - The best way for under 25 renters
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.560]   to avoid that underage fee is to rent with Hertz
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.720]   and be a member of AAA.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.360]   AAA members as young as 20 years old
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.400]   can rent from Hertz with the AAA discount code.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   It's not enough to just be a member of AAA,
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.840]   you have to rent using the AAA discount code
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.760]   and that will waive the underage fee,
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.520]   at least in the U.S. for drivers 20 to 24 years old.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.640]   It's not as easy with the other companies.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.440]   You have to either be on some sort of corporate discount
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.800]   to waive the fee in other cases.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.480]   Hertz far and away, I think they're really targeted
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.080]   that under 25 segment and quite successfully.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.920]   So between the ability to waive the underage fees
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.840]   as well as the discount you get with AAA,
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.520]   it's a no brainer for young drivers to sign up for AAA.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.000]   You also mentioned car seat.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.860]   Another nice thing about AAA discount
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.840]   is that it will give you one free child seat per rental
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.080]   and that can add up to up to $65.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.880]   So if you're renting, if the car seat is, let's say,
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.000]   13.99 a day in a one week rental,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.440]   you can easily pay for the cost of the AAA membership.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.120]   So it's quite a good deal.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.680]   And that doesn't even take into account
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.240]   the fact that if you have a problem with the rental car,
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.400]   you've got roadside service, if you get locked out,
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.320]   if you run out of gas, if you get a flat tire.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.440]   A lot of people will call the rental car company
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.160]   if they have a flat tire and the rental car company
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.000]   is like, "Sure, no problem.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.920]   "We'll send out a tow truck for you."
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.640]   But what they don't realize is that
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.400]   rental car companies offer what they call roadside service
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.720]   as an additional fee.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.080]   And that's akin to a AAA type service.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.040]   And if they send out a tow truck to you,
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.920]   they're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   They're probably gonna charge you for that tow
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.800]   and for the time and probably for the new tire as well.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.400]   Whereas if you've got AAA, hey, you call AAA.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.440]   Let's say, the tire has just got a nail in it or whatever.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.240]   AAA will tow you to the nearest garage.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.620]   They'll plug the hole.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.820]   You return the car, not a big deal, no additional charge.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.560]   Whereas if you go to the rental car company,
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.440]   you can end up paying three, $400
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.000]   by the time the hole's said and done.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.240]   So it's definitely something
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.240]   that you need to take into account.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.400]   - What about extra drivers?
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.240]   I know the one thing that I had,
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.320]   this is probably a two-part thing.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.840]   We were picking up a car in Park City
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.360]   and it was me and my dad.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.000]   And we looked and we were like, "Gosh, the line is so long."
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.880]   But there was no way to even add an extra.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.320]   So first off, there was an extra driver fee
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.000]   that I would have loved to avoid.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.420]   Second off, there was no way that we could figure out
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:37.040]   how to add the extra driver after the fact or in advance.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.960]   So we were gonna have to wait in the line.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.800]   For either of those,
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.480]   is there anything we could have done differently?
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.980]   - So it's a two-part answer here.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.240]   So first off, for avoiding the extra driver fee,
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.440]   if you are a AAA member,
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.280]   you automatically get an extra driver.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.500]   Technically, that driver also has to be a AAA member,
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:59.120]   but the reality is that there's spotting enforcement on that.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.400]   If you are a Costco member
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.080]   and you're renting with the Costco discount code
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.760]   with Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise,
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.240]   there is also an included additional driver.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.560]   If you are renting from various companies,
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.320]   for example, Avis, Budget, Alamo, National, Enterprise,
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.500]   they let spouses drive for free.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.440]   And if you're renting in California,
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.880]   family members can drive for free.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.980]   It's interesting, up until about a year ago,
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.920]   anyone could be an additional driver
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.040]   on a rental in California
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.240]   and the rental car companies were prohibited
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.280]   from charging an additional fee by law,
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.400]   but the rental car companies
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.520]   have been lobbying the state for a while.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.400]   So they kind of neutered that policy a little bit.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.480]   Now, family members can drive for free,
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.860]   but if it's a non-related person,
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.800]   that person will have to pay an additional driver fee
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.080]   unless, of course, it's waived
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.760]   through the additional discounts that I spoke about.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:56.160]   So that's in terms of getting the fee waived.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.760]   We've got a blog post on our site
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.600]   that goes through all the situations,
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.440]   where and when and how.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.600]   Also, when we offer rentals to customers on our site,
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.000]   it'll tell you exactly which offerings
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.480]   include an additional driver,
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.560]   which offerings allow spouses to drive for free.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.460]   So we try to be very transparent
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.880]   in terms of letting our customers know
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.440]   which deal provides which benefits.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.520]   As far as actually adding the additional driver,
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.480]   if you are a loyalty member,
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.200]   meaning if you're using Hertz Ultimate Choice,
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.120]   National Emerald Club,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.320]   if you're picking your own vehicle
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.440]   and driving to the exit booth,
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.840]   there's no need to wait in line.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.920]   The additional driver can be added
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.300]   on the spot at the exit booth.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.720]   So you don't need to wait in line
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.960]   and add the driver beforehand.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.280]   It can be added at the contract.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.680]   You just basically hand your driver's license
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.560]   through the window, as well as the additional driver,
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.200]   and they'll scan it right there at the exit booth.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.600]   So it's pretty easy to do.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.240]   You can even add an additional driver after the fact.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.080]   So for example, let's say you are flying out to Las Vegas
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.320]   and your friend is not arriving until the following day
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.100]   and you will pick up the rental car,
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:03.340]   you could actually go back to the rental car office
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.420]   or any office of the same rental car company,
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.220]   and you can go and add that person
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.120]   to the rental car contract after the fact.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.880]   And that means that if you're picking up at an airport,
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.620]   you could go to an off-airport location
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.740]   where it's not busy,
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.920]   and then the additional driver
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.360]   just has to show the driver's license.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.240]   They will add the extra renter
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.480]   to the contract at that time.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.240]   So there are a lot of different ways
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.760]   that you can slice and dice that.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.320]   - I know nobody wants to wait in line,
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.880]   but I do wanna know, if you are gonna wait in line,
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.320]   is there any trick to score a free upgrade?
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.800]   - There's lots of tricks,
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.520]   but the best trick is being nice.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.720]   It's walking up there with a smile on your face
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.120]   and asking if you can get a complimentary upgrade.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.160]   If you have your heart set on an SUV
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.240]   and you've reserved a compact car,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.560]   smile and ask them if it's possible to,
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.520]   they may have some SUVs available.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.240]   You know, another little known trick
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.960]   is if you're in the lot
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.800]   and you're choosing your own vehicle,
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.600]   maybe there's a row of Camrys
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.600]   and there's really nothing appealing there.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.760]   Those lot attendants have a lot of leeway
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.720]   in terms of what gets assigned to what area.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.080]   So you can speak with a lot of attendants.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.160]   There are people who have been known to provide a little tip
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.380]   or maybe a donut or something like that,
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.000]   or a muffin if it's early in the morning.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.280]   You know, there's definitely ways
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.400]   to kind of get some special treatment there
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.880]   if you're creative about it.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.600]   I needed a minivan.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.320]   I had rented a mid-sized car and I really needed a minivan.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.960]   And I spoke with one of the lot attendants
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.240]   and he hooked me up and it was definitely a good score.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.200]   So, you know, these guys wield a lot of power,
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.240]   but I would say overall, if you're renting at an airport,
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.280]   you really want to be a member of the loyalty program
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.680]   because being able to choose your own vehicle
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.560]   is key and even if that vehicle that you're interested in
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.160]   is not in that area,
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.440]   you can get a little bit of leeway
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.360]   by working the lot a little bit.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   - Finally, you've got your car.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.880]   What do you do if you see these dents, dengs?
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.040]   A lot of times the rental car person's like,
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.560]   "Oh no, it's so small, you don't have to worry about it."
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.800]   Is it important to document
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.040]   every little imperfection in the car?
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.320]   - If you're renting in the US
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.240]   and you're renting from a major company,
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.880]   you do not need to document every tiny little scratch
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.380]   and ding on the car.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.240]   You're gonna have scuffs typically at the back
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.160]   where people were dragging luggage out of the trunk.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.680]   People open up car doors and parking lots
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   and ding the driver's side and the passenger side doors.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.040]   The general rule of thumb is
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.480]   unless the dent is larger than a quarter,
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.800]   the rental car companies aren't gonna bother you about it.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.280]   But that said, it's always good to protect yourself.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.560]   I typically will either take pictures
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.840]   and/or just take a video.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.640]   I put my iPhone into video mode
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.560]   and I literally just walk around the car
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.100]   and I take a video of the entire car.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.560]   I take it from different angles.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.400]   I make sure I catch the roof, the front windshield,
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.960]   and certainly any areas
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.800]   where there might be imperfections there.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.840]   And I try to capture the fact that I'm at the rental lot
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.720]   and I try to capture the employee in the video as well.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.120]   Obviously there's privacy issues,
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.920]   but I'm not trying to call anyone out,
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.560]   but I wanna make sure it's obvious
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.080]   that this is what the car looked like
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080]   when I picked up the car.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.960]   And this way, if you ever return the car
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.720]   and there's ever any question,
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.080]   you've got a video right there and say,
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.760]   "Look, I drove the car out of the lot.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.600]   "This is the video.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.260]   "It's a date, timestamp video
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.840]   "that shows exactly what the car looked like.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.660]   "So how are you gonna accuse me of doing this dent
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.220]   "or the scratch over here?"
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.260]   So that's number one.
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.160]   We also recommend doing the exact same thing
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.500]   at rental return.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.560]   It's not uncommon.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.040]   Well, I shouldn't say it's not uncommon.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.640]   It has been known to happen
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.960]   where the rental car company will mail you days,
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.600]   weeks, even months later and say,
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.060]   "Hey, we found damage on a vehicle
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.740]   "that you previously returned.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.480]   "We're now gonna charge you $1,400 for this big dent.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.520]   "And you know for a fact that you returned the car
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.640]   "and there was no problem with it."
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.860]   Having a documented video or photos
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.200]   that show that you're in the return area
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.040]   may go a long way to be able to dispute
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.160]   those sorts of claims if and when they do come up.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.920]   We also recommend taking a photo.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.960]   We recommend taking your gas receipt
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.320]   and putting it on the dashboard
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.560]   and taking a photo of the dashboard,
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.240]   showing the mileage, the fuel level, and the gas receipt.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.480]   This way, nobody can say you returned the car
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.960]   with less than a full tank of gas.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.240]   No one can say that the mileage was wrong
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.920]   or that you drove an excessive amount of mileage.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.480]   So these are like small things
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.600]   that you can do to protect yourself.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.720]   By and large, most people return and never have any issues,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.400]   but it's important to protect yourself
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.200]   in those situations where it might happen.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.840]   - And you mentioned when you're in the US,
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.880]   how does all of this change internationally?
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.760]   - Well, it's important to remember that internationally,
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.760]   you may be renting from a large firm
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.560]   and that may be a corporate location.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.960]   For example, in a lot of places in Europe,
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.520]   Hertz is basically, Hertz Europe is another company,
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.960]   but it's effectively part of Hertz Global Holdings.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.040]   But then there are other places where
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.800]   you're basically renting for a franchise.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.400]   It's a local company that is subcontracting
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.560]   with the major firm, be it Enterprise or Hertz or Avis,
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.080]   and they're basically putting the brand logo
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.480]   and they're using the reservation system,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.320]   but it's essentially a local company.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.000]   And the policies and the tactics that they use
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.280]   may be quite different.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.680]   I'm always more careful.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.400]   I'm more on my guard outside the US.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   I always take that extra time to take a full video,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.720]   document every little scratch.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.840]   We've definitely heard of situations outside the US
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.280]   where they'll go over the car
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.240]   with a fine tooth comb on return,
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.360]   and they'll try to get you for every little imperfection.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.880]   So it's something that you wanna be extra careful
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.800]   of outside the US.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.400]   But generally, the major companies within the US,
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.240]   they're really not.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.000]   They have better things to do with their time
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.160]   than get you on every little ding and dent,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.760]   but that can be quite different elsewhere.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.680]   - Any other major scams or tricks or tips
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.840]   or hacks for international rentals?
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.320]   - I would say that, make sure you get a receipt.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.120]   You really wanna check the rental car contract
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.680]   before you leave the rental car desk.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.320]   Make sure that it matches with your originally quoted rate.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.440]   And if there are any add-ons,
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.200]   make sure they're being charged correctly.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.680]   And then you wanna get a receipt when you leave.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.280]   And this goes not only for internationally,
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.320]   this goes for the US as well.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.040]   There have been many cases recently documented
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.080]   where the rental car company says,
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.560]   "Oh, just leave the car, we'll send you an email receipt."
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.360]   And then the person leaves and gets on the flight home
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.560]   and realizes three days later,
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.080]   they never got an email receipt.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:36.920]   And then all of a sudden,
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.840]   the fraud prevention department calls and says,
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.720]   "Hey, how come you never returned this car?"
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.000]   And the guy's like, "What are you talking about?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.160]   "I returned the car three days ago.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.320]   "Your agent checked it in."
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.080]   And they're like, "Well, we don't have any record
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.080]   "of you returning it."
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.560]   Well, the problem is that you left the lot
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.760]   without a printed receipt.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.240]   So that can be problematic.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.280]   So we really recommend taking an extra couple of minutes
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.080]   and getting a printed receipt.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.520]   This way you have documented proof
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.240]   that you returned the vehicle.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.440]   Again, going back to that video that I mentioned earlier
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.720]   to make sure you cover any damage claims,
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.680]   that'll also show that you returned the car,
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.960]   the videos and the photos are date, time stamped.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.000]   You really wanna have just a little bit of extra evidence
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.720]   just in case things go sideways.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.800]   And that's actually true if you're running internationally.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.160]   - Okay, last international question.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.320]   I was considering booking a rental car
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.400]   when we went on a trip to Cabo last year,
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.920]   and I was blown away that the rental cars
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.160]   were like a couple dollars a day.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.480]   This was still in the middle of COVID
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.000]   when it seemed like all anyone could talk about
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.640]   was expensive rental cars.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.120]   We ended up not renting a car, but is there some trick there?
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.560]   - Well, the trick is that the rental car companies
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.280]   will give you an abnormally low rate
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.880]   and they'll basically force the insurance on you.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.760]   When renting in Mexico, liability insurance is mandatory
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.280]   and it technically is possible to get liability insurance
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.640]   on your own, but it's very challenging to do so.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.040]   Some companies are better than others
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.640]   and some locations are better than others.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.760]   Avis tends to be better.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.880]   You'll see higher daily rates with Avis,
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.680]   but they will include liability insurance in their rates.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.800]   Whereas with, for example, national,
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   you might see like a $5 a day rate,
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.640]   but you're gonna end up paying $25 a day in liability.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.280]   So usually there's no free lunch.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.400]   If you see an abnormally low base rate,
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.080]   you're probably gonna end up paying for it elsewhere.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.480]   - I think we hit like every question I had on car rentals.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.800]   Hopefully if anyone's listening,
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.040]   that was all the questions you guys have ever written in
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.240]   and we covered it all.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.560]   I wanna talk about two things.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.120]   One, we talked about auto slash throughout
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.960]   this whole process.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.160]   I wanna make sure people really get it
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.720]   because you don't have to actually use it
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.400]   to even book your reservation.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.000]   You can actually just submit the reservation, right?
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.280]   - Right, you can use auto slash two ways.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.400]   Number one is you can request a quote.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.880]   We ask you where you're picking up,
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.080]   when you're picking up, where you're dropping off,
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.400]   and then we ask you which organizations you're a member of,
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.240]   which discounts you qualify for.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.300]   So for example, if you're a AAA member or a Costco member,
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.480]   if you're a member of AARP, if you're old like me
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.680]   and you've got AARP membership,
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.400]   hey, that could get you a great deal.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.320]   And then what we do is we send you an email
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.200]   within about five minutes, we crunch the numbers,
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.560]   we let you know where the best deal is.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.280]   You could go and you could go and crunch the numbers
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.320]   yourself, you can go and go to 10 different websites
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.000]   and try to beat our rate.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.960]   You can go and compare the AAA rate versus the Costco rate
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.620]   versus the AARP rate and maintain a spreadsheet,
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.680]   but it's unlikely you're gonna be able to find
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.200]   a lower rate than what we can offer.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.140]   You're welcome to try.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.940]   But the thing is, just because you have the best rate today
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.740]   doesn't mean you're gonna have the best rate tomorrow
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.380]   or next week or even the day before you pick up the car.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.260]   And that's why we offer a tracking function.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.020]   And essentially what happens is after you book your rental,
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.940]   you track your reservation with us
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.660]   and we will keep looking for better deals
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.900]   right up until the day that you pick up your car.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.100]   Rental rates fluctuate all the time.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.740]   We will find you the best deal upfront,
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.620]   but oftentimes the customers who do the best with us
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.980]   are the ones who are tracking their reservation with us.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.040]   Some customers get three, four, five,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.300]   sometimes 10 price drops over the course of a few months,
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.760]   and that can get the price down by upwards of 40%.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.640]   And the great thing is you don't even have to book
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.840]   with AutoSlash to start with.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.240]   You can book anywhere you want.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.960]   If you're a big kayak fan,
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.480]   if you wanna book with Costco Travel,
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.400]   if you wanna book directly with National, go for it.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.960]   Book your reservation wherever you want.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.360]   Come to our website, click on Track My Rental,
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.600]   and it's a free service.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.440]   We'll keep checking for better deals
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.320]   and we'll let you know if we can find a lower rate.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.820]   So it's one of those things where it's a no-brainer.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.540]   You have nothing to lose and everything to save.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.220]   - And how do you guys make money?
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.180]   - We make a small commission on each rental.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:38.500]   It doesn't cost the renter anything,
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.700]   but we work with various partners in the industry
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.580]   and we're making a small commission on the rental
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:47.140]   for the ability to go and find those great deals for you.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:50.660]   - And how often do customers save money on price drops?
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.620]   Is this like one in a hundred people the price comes down
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.220]   or closer to almost everyone?
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.840]   - Two out of three people will save money
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.300]   on a rental via price drops
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.360]   if you're booking more than a week out.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.720]   So the savings can be significant.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.400]   Typically, we will save people up to 30%
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.800]   off their initial booking.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.920]   You will likely save another 20%
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.960]   if you're tracking the price with us.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.160]   - And is there any stat you guys track
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.400]   of all the total dollars you've saved people?
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.040]   - We've saved people over $100 million.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.320]   We've been in business for about 12 years now
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.420]   and the savings exceed $100 million at this point.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.260]   - That's amazing.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.740]   Okay, so we talked all about rental cars,
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:32.020]   but I gotta ask, what about other things?
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.340]   Hotels, airfare, any tricks there?
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.060]   - It's interesting you mentioned hotels.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.460]   We've got a new site called Hotel Slash.
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.540]   Hotel Slash is intended to get people great deals
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.420]   on hotels, just like cars.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.380]   It works a little bit different in the hotel industry
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.100]   than car rentals.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:50.820]   We're not applying coupons, discount codes.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.500]   We're working with various partners in the industry
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.200]   to get the best possible deals for folks.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.560]   But we're also offering,
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.960]   similarly to Auto Slash, a tracking function.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.280]   And that works whether you're booked with us initially
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.540]   or if you booked elsewhere,
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:06.160]   if you wanna go book with Booking.com or Expedia,
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.840]   you can come and track your hotel reservation with us
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.120]   and we'll let you know if we find a better deal.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.860]   It's a great way to save money.
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.480]   There is price volatility on the hotel side
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.580]   as well as the car rental side.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:20.840]   So we help get a great wholesale rate up front
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.680]   and then we track the price of that rental.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.820]   And if we find a better deal,
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.520]   we'll let you know so you can rebook.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.640]   So it's a great way to save additional money.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.800]   - I've always told a lot of people
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.160]   that if you're booking hotels,
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.360]   there's usually a decent advantage
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.320]   of trying to book directly
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.920]   because you wanna earn points,
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.040]   you wanna earn stuff like that.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.480]   Is that the case with you guys?
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.000]   Can you still put in a loyalty number
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.280]   and earn points on your reservation?
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.480]   - So we don't offer the ability to put in a loyalty number,
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.320]   but oftentimes when you arrive at the hotel,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.680]   you can ask to have them put the loyalty number
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.600]   on the reservation.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.720]   It's not guaranteed.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.500]   Some hotels will be willing to do it.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.200]   Some hotels won't,
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.940]   but it's certainly something that you can try.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:02.200]   As far as getting upgrades and that sort of thing,
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.240]   you can get an upgrade
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.320]   if you're using your loyalty membership.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.240]   But then again, if we're able to save you 30%
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.800]   off the cost of the hotel reservation,
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.000]   you know, it may be worth the savings there.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.240]   So we always recommend trying it both ways.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.120]   And if you wanna book directly with the hotel,
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:16.960]   nothing stops you.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.520]   You can always track it with us
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.360]   and we'll let you know if we find a better deal.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.080]   If we find you a discount that's, you know,
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.720]   maybe 30 bucks off your existing reservation,
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.000]   maybe you decide it's not worth it,
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.240]   you wanna earn points.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.640]   If we find your rate that's $350 lower
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.200]   than your current reservation,
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.400]   a lot of folks will be tempted by those savings.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.560]   So, you know, we don't wanna tell folks
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.800]   what's right for them.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.120]   We just wanna present the savings
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.560]   that everyone can make their own informed decision.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.160]   - I just went to the website for AutoSlash
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.000]   and I realized, okay,
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.320]   that's why I never heard of HotelSlash.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.960]   It's not promoted on the AutoSlash site.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:50.120]   So I went to a HotelSlash and you need a code.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.960]   Is that something that you could provide
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.600]   or how do people get to check this out?
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.560]   - So we're at the end of our beta stage right now.
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.920]   We're gonna be rolling out HotelSlash publicly pretty soon.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.600]   It is gonna be a membership-based service,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.520]   but we're offering an early access code
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.080]   for all the listeners for your blog.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.840]   So you can put in an early access code of all the hacks.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.720]   No spaces, A-L-L-T-H-E-H-A-C-K-S,
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.920]   just one long string.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.120]   And that will get you a lifetime access to HotelSlash.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.400]   You will never have to pay a membership fee.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   You can request a code
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.920]   and it'll automatically sign you up.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.040]   And it's a great way to save money on hotels.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:27.880]   We're signing up.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.760]   Even if you're not looking to stay right now,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.240]   you may be looking to reserve a hotel in the future.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.640]   So signing up now will get you
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.240]   that free access grandfathered in forever.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.080]   - That's amazing.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.240]   Okay, I'll put the link to that.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   And a lot of the stuff we talked in the show notes,
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.560]   some of the blog posts you mentioned,
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.840]   I'll try to find it all so people have that all there.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.200]   Any other favorite travel tricks,
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.600]   hacks that you're known for that friends always,
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.960]   you can share with your friends and family
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.880]   that we should share before we take off?
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.080]   - I can talk about two things.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.360]   One on the flight side.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.760]   So I think with flights, it's interesting.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.240]   COVID has changed airline ticket bookings
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.360]   in the sense that you have a lot more flexibility
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.160]   with ticket changes and cancellations.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.440]   And that provides an opportunity to do something similar
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.160]   to what AutoSlash does in terms of price tracking.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.720]   Google flights is a great tool
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.880]   for tracking your flight pricing.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.720]   If the price of your flight drops,
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.360]   you can often rebook it and get a credit.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.920]   JetBlue, Southwest, United, you can take those funds
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.880]   and put them into a travel bank type of situation
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.200]   where you can use them for future flights.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.760]   If it's within 24 hours and the price drops,
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.920]   you can just cancel it for free and rebook
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.680]   if it's a flight reservation in the US.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.480]   Google flights lets you track flight prices
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.520]   on a specific day.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.240]   You can even go down to a specific flight
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.240]   and a specific airline.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.800]   So it's a pretty easy way.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.680]   Once you book your flight,
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.320]   just go to Google flights and track that.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.120]   You know, it's an opportunity to potentially save there.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.360]   So that's one little flight hack that I like.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.680]   And then on the car rental side,
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.240]   one thing we've been noticing recently
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.720]   is that the car rental companies
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:07.600]   are requiring minimum rental lengths.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.160]   It may be that you go and try to reserve a reservation
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.280]   and you put in a three-day rental request
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.360]   and no availability comes back.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.520]   And that's because
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.680]   with the limited inventory available right now,
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.200]   the car rental companies in many cases
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.920]   don't want to rent cars for shorter periods of time.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.280]   So there may be, for example,
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.920]   a five-day minimum required in order to rent.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.200]   But if you go to a site like carrentals.com or Expedia,
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.240]   you would never know that.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.760]   You would just go put in your request.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.640]   They would say, "Sorry, nothing's found."
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.280]   And you're kind of left to wonder why, you know,
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.360]   there are no cars in Atlanta for, you know,
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.520]   over the coming weekend.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.800]   AutoSlush is a little bit different.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.240]   What we do is we will take your request.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.120]   If we find no inventory, we will try various tactics
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.600]   in order to try to make availability appear.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.360]   And one of the things that we had to start doing
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.160]   during COVID is we realized that if we extend the rental
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.160]   by anywhere from a few hours to a few days,
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.840]   that we can make availability appear almost out of thin air.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.040]   So if you come in and request a quote from AutoSlush
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.680]   for a three-day rental in,
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.360]   let's say, the Atlanta airport over the weekend,
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.200]   we'll come back to you and say,
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.320]   "Hey, we couldn't find any availability for three days,
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.960]   but we found availability for a five-day rental.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.800]   So we extended your return time by two days.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.960]   Oh, but great news.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.800]   You can still return it at your originally intended time.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.520]   And the likelihood is that the car rental company
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.280]   will refund you for the unused days."
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.360]   So it's a great way of gaming the system.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.760]   If you can't find availability, you can do this yourself.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.240]   You don't need to use AutoSlush.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.320]   Go and just try to add a few days onto the rental
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.400]   until you see the inventory start showing up.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.720]   And then again, like I said,
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.720]   just return it when you originally planned to.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.440]   And nine times out of 10, you're gonna get back money
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.440]   for the unused portion of the rentals.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.240]   It's a great hack to use.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.120]   - That brings up one last question.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.160]   Let's say you make a reservation.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.600]   You've got this great rate,
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.560]   and you need to come in a day early or leave a day late.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.320]   Is that something, can you change rental car reservations
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.040]   without having to go back and rebook them
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.960]   and take advantage of the rate you booked?
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.320]   Or how does that work?
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.000]   - You cannot change a reservation
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.840]   without having it repriced to current rental rates.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.360]   In some cases, that may be the same.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   It may be better.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.720]   It may be much worse.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.920]   We recommend coming to AutoSlush and requesting a new quote
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.520]   because we'll rerun all those numbers
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.320]   with all the current discounts.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.680]   That said, if you're initially booked
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.320]   for let's say a 7 p.m. pickup and you're now changed
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.760]   your flight, you're arriving at noon, no problem at all.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.280]   As long as it's the same day,
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.080]   you can go and you can pick up as early as you want.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.640]   If you're trying to pick up the previous day,
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.760]   that's more problematic.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.840]   You're probably gonna have an issue
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.880]   and you probably need to rebook the rental.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.480]   Returning late is no problem at all.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.600]   You can generally just go and return anytime you want.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.520]   Obviously, you should call the rental car company
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.960]   if it's more than 24 hours past the time
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.400]   that you're scheduled to return.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.880]   But the rental car company oftentimes
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.840]   will be willing to extend the rental.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.480]   If it's less than one day that you're extending,
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.480]   you can usually just return and the rental car company
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.720]   will adjust the price automatically.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   - This has been fantastic.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.600]   Thank you so much.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.520]   So many good deals.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.360]   I hope everybody saves money on rental cars,
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.280]   especially over the coming summer
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.960]   where I know they're pretty expensive.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.760]   Thanks so much for being here.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.600]   - It's been a pleasure, Chris.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.440]   Thanks for having me.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.020]   (upbeat music)

[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.680]   And if so, then you can be thankful
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.240]   for your fellow listener, Josh,
