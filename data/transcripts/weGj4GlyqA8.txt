[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   I think about tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.260]   I'm thinking mostly about IRAs, 401Ks, 403Bs,
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.520]   but my favorite is probably the Roth IRA and the HSA.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.760]   And that's because they offer a ton of flexibility,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.980]   really low fees, because you can house them
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.680]   usually at a brokerage account of your choosing,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500]   and some of the best investment options.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.540]   And on the HSA side, you've got the triple tax deduction
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.580]   of being able to put money in tax-free,
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.260]   being able to take it out tax-free,
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.520]   and being able to have it grow tax-free.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.700]   So it's an amazing account.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.060]   And on the Roth IRA side,
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420]   I know many people don't think that they might be eligible
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.460]   because of their income or their workplace retirement plans.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.920]   I'd encourage you to go look
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.140]   into a backdoor Roth IRA contribution.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.900]   It's kind of a workaround that the IRS
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.340]   has finally signed off on, if you will,
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.680]   and it's something I do every year.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   And so take a look at that as a way
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.280]   to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.120]   even if you're not directly eligible.
