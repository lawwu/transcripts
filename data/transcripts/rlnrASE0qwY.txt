[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:15.280]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, podcast number 14.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.960]   Today, we have a special guest, Chris Mamula,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.240]   author of the new book, Choose FI, Your Blueprint
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.360]   to Financial Independence.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:41.000]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.640]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.360]   This podcast, as with all podcasts,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.760]   are brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.280]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.960]   Today, I'm pleased to have Chris Mamula,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.160]   one of the authors of a new book called
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.800]   Choose FI, Your Blueprint to Financial Independence.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.560]   The other co-authors of the book were Brad Barrett and Jonathan
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.960]   Mendoza.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.240]   These young men have written a truly fantastic book
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280]   for not only young people, all of us should learn from them.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280]   I am very pleased to have with us today
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.840]   one of the co-authors of Choose FI, Your Blueprint
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.120]   to Financial Independence, Chris Mamula.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.880]   Welcome, Chris.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.760]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520]   And it's an honor for me to be here with so many people who
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.840]   I read and follow, who I've seen have been your prior guests,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480]   and not to mention Mr. Bogle himself.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.120]   So it's quite an honor.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.680]   Well, you have quite a story yourself.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.600]   And I want to start out by you talking about your background
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.840]   and how you got to writing this book and also your blog,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.600]   Can I Retire Yet?
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.480]   and all the great work that you've
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.080]   put into the FI community.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.120]   So why don't you start out telling us a little bit
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.880]   about yourself.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   Sure, so I graduated with a Master of Physical Therapy
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   in 2001.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.240]   And so I had 20 years of formal education
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.180]   from kindergarten through grade 12
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.560]   and my bachelor's and my master's.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.860]   But in that time, I never had any financial education.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.080]   So like most people, we spend all this time
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.600]   learning to gain the skills to earn money.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200]   But nobody really ever teaches you what to do with it.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.600]   So I was pretty fortunate in that my parents instilled in me
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.800]   just a kind of a disdain for debt, I guess you would say.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.560]   And so from day one, I was a great saver.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.280]   My wife had a similar upbringing to me
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.760]   in that she wasn't raised with a lot of money,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.280]   but she didn't have that foundation.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.960]   So she had some debt.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.720]   And going into our marriage, we didn't
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.120]   want to get married with debt.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.440]   And that's something we talked about together.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.120]   What we agreed to do was just live off of her salary
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.720]   and use everything I made to get us out of debt
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.080]   before we got married.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.500]   And that was working really well.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.520]   So it's something we just kind of stuck with.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.600]   And so we always lived off her salary and saved mine.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   And our careers kind of grew in parallel.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.040]   So we basically had a 50% savings rate our whole lives.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   But we really didn't have a plan because we
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.400]   didn't know what we were doing.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.900]   And so I kind of always bought into this idea
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.760]   that investing is complicated.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.160]   So we invested with an advisor, and we really
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.720]   did no due diligence.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.240]   And I kind of bought into this idea that retirement is at 65,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.160]   and maybe early retirement was 55 or 60
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400]   if you're really lucky and you do everything right.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.040]   And so again, we had no plan for that.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.840]   So we just kind of fumbled through life
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.800]   until around 2012, about 10 years after getting started.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.540]   We didn't think we could have kids.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.000]   My wife found out she was pregnant.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.640]   And so I realized I had to get serious about finance.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.980]   And that's when I kind of stumbled
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.360]   into the early retirement, the fire blogs,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.480]   the financial independence, retire early.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.880]   And they really changed my life.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.520]   So that's kind of what motivated me to start
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   writing about the topic.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.760]   Chris, I want to get into the FIRE movement, F-I-R-E.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.960]   What does it stand for?
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.840]   When did it start?
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.760]   What's the motivation behind financial independence,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.720]   retire early?
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.440]   And what are the different splinter movements from that?
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.880]   Can you describe the whole culture of FIRE for us?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.560]   Yeah, sure.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   So let's just start with the definition.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.560]   So FIRE is Financially Independent, Retire Early.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   It's kind of a catchy, cute acronym.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.680]   But in a lot of ways, I think it turns people off,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.080]   because people get hung up on the whole retire early,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.520]   and people have perceptions of what retirement means.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.320]   And so in some ways, we're trying to move away from that.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.080]   We really focus on financial independence
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.480]   and really don't focus too much on the retire early.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   I think what it's all about is just really lining up
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.840]   your values with your spending.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.480]   So typical advice is you save 10% or 15% of your income,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.760]   and that puts you on a path where you're going to retire
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.520]   in your 60s or 70s.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.760]   And basically, we just kind of flipped that on its head
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.480]   and said, if you can save far more than that,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.000]   you can free yourself up and become
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.120]   financially independent much earlier in life.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.240]   And then if you choose to retire, you certainly can.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.520]   But most people that I've come across in this movement
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.120]   choose to go on and do just bigger and better things,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.760]   and things that more line up with what
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.000]   they want to do versus what they have to do to earn an income.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.200]   And as far as the origin, I guess
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.440]   I probably have to credit Vicki Robin, whose
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.320]   book Your Money or Your Life was published in the early '90s.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.000]   And it was very popular at the time,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.200]   but kind of like most books, it kind of fell off.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.700]   Even she didn't know that a lot of the early FIRE bloggers
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.400]   kind of picked up on her ideas and turned it
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.040]   into this FIRE movement.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.760]   And the early influences were kind of all looking the same,
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.000]   like white males, engineering, really focused on maybe
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.040]   spreadsheets and optimization and frugality.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.960]   And so when I got into writing in 2013--
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.200]   and honestly, I kind of fit a lot of these stereotypes
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.600]   because I'm a white guy, and I was part of a higher-earning
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   professionals, and we had no kids.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.360]   And then, like I said, I got serious once we had one child.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.320]   But I was in the health care industry,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.200]   and I don't know anything about spreadsheets.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.720]   I didn't know anything about finance.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.760]   And so I was kind of--
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.960]   at the time, I think I was diversity.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.520]   But I think a lot of that initial perception
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.000]   is kind of what people still think,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.760]   and it's like this monolithic thing.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.920]   When really, there are so many different stories now.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.120]   And I think this FIRE message is really
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.960]   attractive for parents looking to create space in their lives
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.840]   to spend time with kids, maybe older adults who are way
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.520]   behind on retirement savings.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.360]   And this lets them supercharge that.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.200]   Or just people burnt out on careers who want
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.920]   to do something different, and it gives them
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.980]   some leeway and some courage to do something
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.060]   different with their life.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.400]   So it's definitely a much more diverse community
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.800]   than I think people perceive it to be.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.220]   And you started a blog about this.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.940]   Can I retire yet?
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.700]   So actually-- so I started writing back in probably 2013,
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.580]   and I wrote a little blog called Eat the Financial Elephant.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.140]   And it's based on that riddle, how do you eat an elephant?
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.480]   And you do it one bite at a time.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.300]   And it's because I felt so overwhelmed by finance.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.900]   And it was really-- a lot of it was to hold myself accountable.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.700]   And I built a little audience, but nothing--
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.540]   I wasn't having any kind of impact.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.740]   So as I was leaving my career in 2017,
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.700]   this movement, this idea changed my life.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.220]   And I wanted to reach more people.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.980]   And I wanted to maybe change some
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.460]   of those perceptions of what fire looks like to people.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.220]   But I didn't have a platform to do it from.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.420]   And my idea was to start a podcast
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.980]   and talk to different people who influenced me.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.960]   And then-- so Brad Barrett and Jonathan Mendonca,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.620]   they started the Choose FI podcast a few months ahead
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.340]   of that.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.100]   And so I reached out to them probably in April of 2017.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.260]   And we agreed to partner on the book.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.140]   And then in August of that year, there was--
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.680]   the Can I Retire Yet blog was started
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.780]   by a gentleman named Darrow Kirkpatrick.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.220]   And he had built a nice following.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.000]   And I loved that blog.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.620]   But I kind of sensed he was burning out.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.060]   He was a one-man show doing it.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.860]   And so I reached out to him and said,
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.500]   would you be open to a partner?
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.420]   And he was receptive.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.700]   So I kind of-- before I actually, quote unquote,
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.300]   "retired" from my physical therapy job,
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.060]   I had my next two projects lined up.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.540]   And so I've been writing with Darrow at the blog
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.260]   since, I guess, December of--
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.700]   or since January of 2018.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.900]   You feature other bloggers and other podcasters
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.280]   all the way through the book, which is extremely well-written,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.620]   by the way.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.540]   You're a great writer.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.340]   This is a very, very well-written book.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.780]   I read it cover to cover, very easy to understand,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.400]   very easy to follow, a lot of great information in there.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.360]   But one of the things you did throughout the book
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.580]   was you were referencing all these other blogs
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.940]   and all these other bloggers and all the different points
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.340]   that they were talking about.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.900]   And you have a whole list of bloggers and podcasts
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.820]   and so forth in the book, which is really
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.260]   a wonderful reference.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.960]   But in your site, you started writing about this
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.300]   and you started focusing on this culture.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.140]   And I really want to talk about the culture of Fi
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.060]   because it's very similar to a Bogleheads culture.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.460]   The Bogleheads started maybe 20 years ago,
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.980]   first on the Morningstar forum, and then we went out on our own
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.380]   and had our own bogleheads.org website.
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.860]   But it is a culture and it is a community.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.060]   The Fi community is very similar,
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.660]   and the goals of both communities are very similar.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.220]   There might be a little bit of a generation gap.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.860]   So could you talk about the Fi community and the culture?
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.420]   Yeah, sure.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.100]   And first off, thanks for the kind words about the book.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.340]   I really appreciate that, especially coming from you.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.420]   But I was just in Detroit promoting the book,
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.540]   and I was staying with a guy named Joe Saucihai.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.900]   And he has a pretty popular podcast
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.980]   called Stacking Benjamins.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.260]   And it's kind of comedy mixed with personal finance.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.940]   And he and I had a really great conversation.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.140]   And he kind of pointed out to me that there's 300 million people
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.580]   in the United States.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.320]   And so even if you have 3 million people
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.940]   that you're reaching, which even the Bogleheads or even
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.100]   maybe Dave Ramsey and Sue Zorman,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.540]   when you get to that level, nobody's
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.500]   really reaching that percent of that number of people.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.140]   And if you are, that's 1% of the population.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.860]   So overall, as personal finance, I
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.540]   think we're failing to get out and reach people.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.740]   And so there's a lot of snipping back and forth
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.380]   between these, like maybe the Boglehead community and the Fi
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   community and the Dave Ramsey community.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.640]   And really, we need to be building upon one another
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.780]   and pointing out what each other is doing well
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.620]   so we can reach a bigger audience.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.900]   And with Choose Fi, that's what they did is they kind of--
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.300]   I think a lot of personal finance is guru-driven.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.660]   And what they kind of do is they highlight people
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.580]   who just have compelling stories.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.460]   And in each episode, they really focus
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.100]   on what are the actionable steps people can take.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.860]   And we tried to build on that in the book and say,
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.300]   how can we take the key lessons, and then we kind of just
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.700]   put it in a more organized fashion
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.820]   than you really are able to on a podcast.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.900]   And kind of building up everyone and choosing
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.140]   the best of what everybody is doing versus kind of snipping
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.980]   and trying to kind of protect your little piece of the pie.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.180]   We really want to grow the pie and reach a much bigger
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.140]   audience.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.780]   And so I think where, like you said,
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.220]   there's just so much overlap between the Fi community
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.980]   and the Bogleheads messaging.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.580]   And so I think if we could kind of work together and reach
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.780]   a bigger audience, it's way more productive,
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.500]   and we're going to be able to help a lot more people.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.700]   And that's kind of where we're trying
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.460]   to take things right now with the culture and the community.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.260]   Well, that's great.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.500]   Because for us at the Bogleheads,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.340]   we are always trying to figure out how we can reach more
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.380]   people.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.100]   And our push is to try to reach out
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.940]   to other communities like yours and work together with you
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.460]   to better educate more people.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.220]   Because that's really the goal of everyone.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.060]   This is so important for society and so important
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.540]   for our fellow citizens and make them better investors.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.860]   And get them away from the hawks on Wall Street.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.580]   I mean, you talk about that in your book.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.540]   And I think you did a great job, by the way,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.260]   talking about your story of 10 years
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.660]   with the financial advisor before you finally
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.900]   realized what was going on.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.420]   I mean, that happens everywhere.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.340]   And it's a majority of the population are trapped in that.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.620]   And I think that by working together,
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.220]   these different groups working together,
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.500]   will help just make the message more powerful and louder.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.100]   Because we don't have a lot of money,
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.900]   and you don't have a lot of money.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.460]   And so we're fighting against a trillion-dollar industry that
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.340]   has, it seems like, unlimited wealth.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.980]   Yeah, and I can't agree with that more.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.980]   And like I said, if you kind of look at the things
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.180]   that we kind of argue about in the personal finance
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.980]   community compared to where people are,
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.620]   just as we record this, last week
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.620]   there was an article in The Wall Street Journal
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.260]   about how so many people were going to now seven-year car
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.580]   loans from five-year car loans.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.220]   And the average savings rate-- I mean,
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.140]   I know this is something we cited in the book.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.740]   It's like 5% across the population.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.420]   So like I said, yes, I mean, there are little things.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.960]   Each of us could do better, and we can help each other improve
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.100]   our messages, absolutely.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.780]   But I mean, overall, I think when
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.460]   we could be really helping people who are just missing
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.220]   and not getting the big picture.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.860]   We're not competing against each other.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.700]   We're competing against the Kardashians, and the NFL,
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.180]   and the things that people like build their life around
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.220]   while they have no idea what an expense ratio is
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.620]   or anything like that.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.200]   We're going to go through the book now
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   and what you've done, how you've organized it.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.900]   I think the very first thing that struck me
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.420]   as I was reading one of the earlier chapters
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.260]   was the stages of financial independence.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.980]   And I've never seen this before, what the stages are.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.820]   And you list them out from one through seven.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.900]   And I'd like you to quickly go through the stages,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.940]   because I think they were really well done.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.100]   And I appreciate that.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.180]   And again, like you said, you complimented my writing.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.140]   And I wish I could take credit for these ideas.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.540]   But again, what we did is we built on all these ideas.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.900]   So this was a blogger who was on the podcast,
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.300]   and he talked about this.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.140]   And I think traditional finance, it
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.660]   focuses so much on retirement and retirements,
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.980]   like the end goal.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.140]   And what we really wanted to do is reshape the conversation.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.780]   And so we started with just really once you get to zero,
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.540]   if you're out of debt, and really, you
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.660]   can define it in a number of ways.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.460]   But most people, they're kind of trapped
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.800]   because their mortgage payment, their car loan payments,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.100]   maybe they still have student loans, credit card loans.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.860]   And so their next paycheck is already
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.540]   spent before it ever comes.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.900]   So just getting to zero, however you want to define that,
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.340]   is so powerful, because it starts to let you
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.700]   start choosing going forward.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.540]   And then as you start to build on that,
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.420]   just having a fully funded emergency fund,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.580]   that's a hallmark of personal finance.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.660]   And that's really like a Dave Ramsey concept
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.940]   I've seen a lot, where you have six months of your expenses
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.780]   saved.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.980]   And I think that's great advice, but if you
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.460]   look at traditional advice, they say
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.340]   you save 10% of your income, say.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.860]   So if you're doing that, after a year,
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.180]   you're going to have basically a month of savings.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.180]   And it's going to take you about five years just
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.240]   to get that six months of savings built up.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.180]   And it's no wonder people fall off, because it's so slow,
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.140]   and you don't see any momentum.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.540]   So what we do is we say, if you can build a higher savings
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.140]   rate, and we just hypothetically throw out the number 50%
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.220]   savings rate, for one thing, that's
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.160]   going to lower the bar of how much it takes
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.860]   to save to get six months of savings
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.300]   by being a little bit more frugal
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.740]   and watching your spending.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.820]   And also, that frees up the money to save.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.460]   And if you can save 50%, now you can
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.980]   have a six-month emergency fund in only six months,
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.500]   instead of five or six years.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.860]   And so it's a total game changer,
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.420]   and it lets people to start have freedom and peace of mind.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.060]   And we just kind of build up through the phases
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.700]   till you get to ultimately full financial independence,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.740]   and then even financial independence with cushion
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.420]   is our last level, where you're having greater than 30 times
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.940]   your annual expenses.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.980]   And you can pretty safely retire at that point
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.180]   and even be comfortable to maybe grow your spending,
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.560]   depending on how the market does.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.940]   So really trying to reframe that conversation
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.140]   from an all or nothing to a conversation
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.220]   where your power is growing and building throughout the phases.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.860]   In the next chapter, you get right into the whole thing
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.220]   isn't really about money.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.340]   It's about having the right way.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.980]   The money is just a facilitator of that.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.300]   So the money is just a tool.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.420]   What you're really going for before you even go for the money
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.420]   is a philosophy.
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.700]   And you talk a lot about philosophy.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.220]   Yeah, so kind of the framework I wrote the whole book with
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.980]   is that you have to learn the rules.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.340]   And you mentioned briefly my bad experience
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.460]   with the financial industry.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.740]   But I think a lot of people, they go in
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.760]   and they know the rules.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.700]   They know that you get a college degree
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.940]   so you can get a good job.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.940]   And then once that starts, the first things you do
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.820]   is you buy a house.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.020]   And you determine how big of a house
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.820]   or how much you spend based on your income.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.660]   And you can spend x percent.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.620]   And you buy two cars.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.940]   And everybody knows you buy them with loans.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.300]   And this kind of goes on and on.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.900]   You save 10% so you can retire at 65.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.500]   And none of these things are rules.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.780]   So kind of where we start is you have to unlearn the rules
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.580]   and just kind of get over all these things
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.220]   that people just blindly accept.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.180]   And really, a lot of this is just about
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.300]   asking better questions so you can get better answers.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.980]   And then once you unlearn the rules,
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.620]   then we kind of get into the rules of
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.540]   what is the math behind saving?
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.220]   What are the rules you have to know to invest wisely?
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.540]   What are the rules to grow your income?
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.820]   And all these little levers you can pull.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.420]   But I really think unless you unlearn the rules first
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.220]   and break down those things that people quote unquote know,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.960]   you're gonna really have a hard time.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.940]   - As we move along in the book,
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.980]   you have a section called Becoming a Lifelong Learner.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.020]   And I looked at that and I said that is perfect
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.360]   because I happen to be writing a book right now.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.900]   And I will give you the name and selfishly promote it,
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.140]   but it's not gonna be out for a little while.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.380]   It's called A Few Good Funds,
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.900]   The Genius of Simple Investing.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.420]   And the last chapter is all about lifelong learning.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.900]   So as I'm reading your book,
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.340]   it says become a lifelong learner
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.100]   because it is so important that once you have the concept,
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.340]   once you have the philosophy, once you get it,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.460]   once you set yourself up,
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.020]   it can easily be forgotten and go by the wayside.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.260]   And the second thing is,
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.060]   one thing that really not only helps you,
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.700]   but helps a lot of other people,
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.980]   is not only your lifelong learning,
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.720]   and you get to this in the book very quickly,
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.060]   is once you learn it, teach other people.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.260]   And teaching other people helps you stay the course.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.220]   I thought that was fascinating.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.620]   And I was actually including the exact same things.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.700]   I was reading your book.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.540]   I just saw so many things
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.300]   that you just did such a great job bringing out.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.140]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.940]   And yeah, and it's kind of funny,
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.620]   like when I talk about my background,
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.580]   that five years ago, six years ago, I had no clue.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.260]   I didn't know what an index fund was.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.380]   I wasn't utilizing my 401(k)
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.020]   'cause my advisor said that he had better investments for me
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   and I totally bought hook, line, and sinker.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.780]   I mean, I was completely clueless.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.960]   And now I'm writing this book,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.620]   which is hopefully gonna have a pretty large impact
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.580]   and be read by a lot of people.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.500]   And it's just that matter of,
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   I realized, okay, I'm making a lot of mistakes
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.100]   and it's easy to wallow in that
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.300]   and feel bad for yourself or get angry.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.680]   But what I did is said, okay, I need to correct course
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.020]   and I need to keep learning
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.420]   and then learning at a deeper level.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.580]   And then as I was doing this
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.460]   and seeing the impact it had on my life,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.900]   yeah, I almost felt an obligation
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.780]   to share it with other people
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.640]   so they could do the same thing.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.300]   And in some ways, I think you get imposter syndrome
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.980]   that who am I to be qualified to write a book
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.940]   about personal finance and investing?
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.820]   And on the same token, I think I'm the perfect person
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.960]   'cause I know exactly how all those people
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.580]   that really need to get this message are thinking
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.900]   'cause I was stuck in that pattern for, like I said,
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.500]   10 years before I finally started questioning things
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.340]   and figuring it out.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.820]   So, yeah, I mean, I think that's super important.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.300]   - Yeah, what we find is right is in many of this stuff
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.940]   about personal finance and investing and taxation,
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.100]   all of this is routine.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.100]   I mean, these are the rules and all you're doing
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.060]   is figuring out how to put it all together,
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.860]   how to link it all together, and then writing about it.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.780]   I mean, we're not creating any kind of a new way
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.140]   to invest in real estate,
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.940]   and we're not creating any new way to invest in index funds.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.260]   I mean, it's all out there.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.380]   We're not trying to recreate the tax code in any way.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.740]   It's all out there.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.580]   It's just a matter of putting it all together
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.860]   and showing how it all works together
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.460]   and explaining it to people in a way
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.340]   where it makes it easy to understand.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.300]   And so me, I don't take any credit for anything I've done
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.380]   as far as index funds and talking about ETFs
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.740]   and asset allocation and all that,
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.300]   because it's all out there.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   It's just a way in which you explain it
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.100]   and being able to explain it to people
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.620]   so that they understand it.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.580]   So in a way, teaching people how to do it.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.980]   And I think that's really where you have a real knack
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.300]   and a real skill to be able to do that
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.100]   because your book is so good at teaching people.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.380]   - And again, I appreciate that.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.180]   And a lot of that is just, again,
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.860]   because it's not really me.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.180]   I mean, yes, I'm the one writing it
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.700]   and putting it together and organizing it,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.820]   but we've taken a lot of people who were super generous
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.340]   with sharing their stories on the podcast with those guys.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.220]   And then they were generous with allowing me to take that
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.820]   and kind of put it together.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.780]   And then we kind of repackaged it in a way
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.220]   that just makes it consumer friendly.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.620]   And particularly to people who aren't maybe inclined
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.060]   to be in the Bogleheads community
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.620]   or to be inclined to be saving large percentage
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.860]   and be in the FI community
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.300]   and just take it to ordinary people
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.620]   who most need this message and really make it accessible.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.620]   And that was what we wanted to do with this book
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.380]   and not be judgmental and not be dogmatic,
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.220]   but just saying, look, here's the different options
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.060]   that you have.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.140]   Here are people with really inspiring stories
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.500]   that probably somebody in there
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.980]   is gonna look a lot like you.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.820]   And you can kind of take their story
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.140]   and take the things that you like from it
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.220]   and then take from other stories
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.020]   and put together your own path
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.140]   to achieve financial independence.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.060]   - Yeah, you wrote in here that you do not have to adopt
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.060]   anyone else's definition of success or failure,
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.140]   but to gain traction on the path to FI,
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.220]   you do have to determine what you value
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.060]   and then start spending your time and money accordingly.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.420]   So as you figure out what's important to you,
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.020]   and then you start on that path.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.940]   - Yeah, and there's a term,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.540]   and I'm not sure quite where that came from,
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.980]   so I'm hoping we didn't steal this from somebody,
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.660]   but we call it a valuist.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.780]   And instead of saying like you have to be frugal
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.660]   or you have to be a minimalist,
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.540]   you don't have to be anything,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.980]   but you do have to figure out what you value
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.100]   and then does your spending reflect that?
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.380]   And for a lot of people, I think,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.340]   if you were being very honest and looked at it,
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.820]   a lot of people would say no.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:01.020]   And if you think that you have to suffer and sacrifice,
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.580]   frankly, none of us, including me,
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.820]   are going to be able to save 50% by scrimping and saving.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.380]   You do it by cutting out the things
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.620]   that you don't value anyway
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.540]   and you spend the money where you do value.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.780]   But a lot of those things that, again,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.980]   people just do reflexively,
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.700]   like buying the biggest house they could afford
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.220]   or the most car they can afford.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.740]   I mean, if that's truly what you value,
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.180]   then by all means, do it.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.740]   But I question how many people are happier
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.780]   because they have a bigger house or a fancier car.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.900]   And if it's not, then cut it and be honest
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.700]   and don't be afraid to make changes.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.060]   - You talk about the three big things
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.260]   and you just hit on them.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.300]   You talk about the way to get a high savings rate
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.380]   is to focus on the big things that you can control
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.380]   that are the big budget eaters, if you will,
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.860]   and that is housing, transportation, and food.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.940]   And those three things together,
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.300]   if you can control your housing cost,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.700]   if you can control your transportation cost,
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.780]   if you can control your food cost,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.260]   then you can bring more money to the bottom line.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.060]   - Yeah, and I kind of talked how my wife and I
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.840]   just stumbled into getting a lot of those things right.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.860]   There was no fire movement back then.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.660]   And so we just kind of stumbled into it.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.900]   So we were getting a lot of the big things right.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.060]   And so for us, it was really pretty easy
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.460]   because if you don't inflate your lifestyle,
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.180]   and you can live pretty comfortably,
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.780]   and then as we had our basics with the housing and the cars,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.940]   kind of, it was locked in,
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.580]   and we were able to inflate our lifestyle
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.420]   as our careers grew.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.060]   So we were traveling more and doing fancier things
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.300]   and eating at better restaurants and things like that.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.020]   But because we had the key things just locked in
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.980]   and we were living so far below our means, it was easy.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.420]   Unfortunately, for some people,
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.780]   you're gonna find this later in life,
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.260]   and it may feel a little bit of sacrifice,
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.980]   and you're gonna feel a little bit of the pinch
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.700]   if you have to go back to get those things right.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.620]   But really, if you don't get those things right
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.380]   one way or the other, either by starting well
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.060]   or by going back and making changes,
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.940]   it's really hard to develop that savings rate
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.060]   because those things,
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.980]   if you look at the average person's spending,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.500]   they make up such a large percentage
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.480]   that if you don't get those big things right,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.340]   it's gonna be very hard.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.420]   - And one of the other things, of course,
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.220]   that's big for everybody is paying taxes.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.260]   And I've found in talking with people
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.060]   that on the investing side and how to set up their accounts
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.020]   so that the right assets are in the right accounts
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.900]   and just how to structure the whole thing,
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.940]   and even when they were doing distributions,
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.100]   doing Roth conversions, I mean, the whole tax code
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.500]   and working the tax code to the maximum that you can
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.400]   for your advantage from savings to distributions
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.080]   to knowing where all the break points are
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.780]   for things like Medicare charges,
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.600]   for retirees and so forth,
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.300]   to understand the tax code as an investor
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   and to work that tax code gets you so much more money
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.700]   than trying to go out and pick
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.700]   any actively managed mutual fund that might outperform
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.820]   that it's not even a comparison.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.580]   You spend your time on taxes and you have a whole chapter,
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.420]   a whole section in here about working the tax code
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.160]   to your advantage, and I think it was a really good chapter.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.680]   - Yeah, and I think that's where the book gets really fun.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.860]   So, I mean, some people, it's gonna be pretty easy,
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.900]   the housing, cars, and food,
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.860]   and some people, it's really gonna be a struggle,
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.120]   but you have to get those things to get the savings rate,
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.700]   but once you can do that, and it's really simple things,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.360]   like just using your work-sponsored 401(k) account.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.660]   For a lot of people, that's the easiest
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.540]   and biggest thing you can do.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.620]   Doing things like learning to be a index fund investor
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.980]   and cutting your expenses,
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.780]   like it can be seen as a sacrifice, I guess,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.780]   for people, if you say you have to live in a smaller house
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.300]   or drive a less fancy car, but I mean, I personally,
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.780]   I've never met anybody that said,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.700]   man, my life would be better
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.220]   if I just paid a little more taxes
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.340]   or if I could just pay my financial advisor
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.540]   a little bit more.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.540]   So, I mean, those things, I mean,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.860]   they add so much value to your life
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.300]   and you're actually spending,
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.860]   and we're talking big dollars less.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.700]   Like, I know for me, we talked about some of the mistakes
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.360]   I was making as I became a do-it-yourself investor
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.980]   and bought into the index fund philosophy.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.420]   I started saving about $10,000 in taxes
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.180]   and $10,000 in fees every single year, year over year,
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.280]   and those things were adding zero value to my life.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.420]   So, I mean, talk about something that's easy to do
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.860]   because it makes your life better and you become wealthier.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.760]   It's a no-brainer.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.460]   - One of the big expenses for young people, of course,
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.980]   is going to college and you spend an awful lot of time
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.500]   on talking about things like college or hacking college
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.220]   and how to pay for college.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.140]   And I think the whole hacking college idea,
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.520]   it was really unique.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.500]   I had not heard it before.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.260]   Again, you know, always learn something
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.740]   by reading other people's material
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.180]   and the whole hacking college idea was really new to me.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.140]   Could you describe that?
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.400]   - Yeah, so I talk a lot about my mistakes,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.980]   but if there's one thing that I did right,
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.460]   so my wife and I, between us, we have six college degrees
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.820]   and we did that with, she had about,
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.100]   we started with about $20,000 of debt from her undergraduate
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.620]   and otherwise we did it all without any debt.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.540]   And it's been such a game changer
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.600]   compared to most people we see coming out.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.440]   Like the average physical therapist who I was mentoring
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.060]   when I was working as a physical therapist,
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.620]   they were coming out six figures in debt.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.580]   So it's a complete game changer.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.500]   And I really think a lot of it is just,
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   I'm again talking about like just questioning the rules.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.380]   I think most people think that to go to college
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.540]   and to do it without debt, you have one of two paths.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.380]   You get lucky and you get a scholarship
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.100]   or you have wealthy parents who are able
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.580]   to fund you the whole way through.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.060]   And what we found is just, I think a lot of times,
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.040]   you know, if you have a hammer,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.880]   everything starts to look like a nail.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.160]   And I think college, just debt to finance college
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.140]   is so easy.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.460]   So if you limit that or eliminate it completely,
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.020]   there's so many more options out there
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.980]   from working through college to, you know,
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.660]   to looking for different scholarships,
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.860]   smaller scholarships that people don't bother applying for
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.340]   'cause they don't think they can get to, you know,
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.860]   doing like when you're in high school,
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.020]   getting some credits that apply to your degree.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.700]   And most of the people we profiled use all of these
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.640]   and some other strategies.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.340]   And if you are able to do that
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.420]   and you get a little bit here and a little bit there,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.460]   you can drastically reduce the debt
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.300]   or eliminate the debt and come out debt-free.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.180]   And that's a complete game changer.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.980]   And it's funny that I've had a lot of positive feedback
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.660]   about that chapter.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.300]   I absolutely loved our editor.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.140]   And we actually cut a couple chapters
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.060]   and made some big changes,
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.220]   but she actually recommended we cut that chapter.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.220]   She said, you know, a lot of people are writing about that.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.000]   And that was the one place where I pushed back
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.700]   and we left the chapter 'cause I think it's so important.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   And one of my co-authors on the book, Jonathan,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.120]   he actually came out of school $168,000 in debt
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.720]   and it was a big piece of his story.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.120]   And when you can kind of contrast
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.400]   and you see like it took him basically a decade of working
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.200]   and saving to get out of that just to get back to zero
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.720]   versus some of these people in the book, myself included,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.040]   who were able to get out debt-free.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   And again, it's just a, it's a total game changer.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.080]   So yeah, hopefully we can add to the conversation
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.000]   and instead of making it a black and white,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.240]   college is good or college is bad.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.600]   I think for a lot of people, it's very valuable,
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.800]   but you have to approach it in the right way.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.400]   - You talked in here a little bit
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.680]   about making college pay.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.640]   In other words, well, you know,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   you wanna maximize the benefit from your degree
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.720]   and minimize the cost.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.640]   And by maximizing benefit,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.960]   I'm glad to see that you wrote a lot about,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.240]   go out and get a degree
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.120]   that you can actually use to earn money.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.600]   I mean, to spend $200,000 on a degree
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.720]   that you're gonna make 60,000 or $50,000 a year on
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.000]   just doesn't make any sense.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.560]   I mean, you talk about college as an investment
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.960]   where you expect to get a rate of return on that investment.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.560]   And I have not seen a lot of that
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.600]   and I'm glad that you brought that up.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.040]   - Yeah, and it kind of ties together.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.680]   I mean, I think any of these things in a silo,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.080]   they maybe don't make as much sense.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.960]   But when you look at the whole grand picture,
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.400]   again, we embrace being a lifelong learner.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.640]   And you look at like the things that I've done
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.120]   with learning to manage my investments
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.520]   and how much that's paid off
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.440]   and learning to write
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.380]   just by sitting down at a keyboard every morning
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.640]   and picking up some books at the library.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.660]   You can learn everything,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.760]   but I didn't need to go get a journalism degree
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.520]   and I didn't need to go get a finance degree
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.640]   to be able to do these things.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.240]   So there's a lot of things you can learn for free.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.040]   I mean, we live in an amazing world
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.180]   where many of these things,
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.760]   you don't have to have a degree
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.400]   and you can be pretty successful.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.040]   I mean, some things like if you wanna be a doctor
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.240]   or you wanna be a lawyer,
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.520]   obviously you have to have the paper
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.560]   that says you're qualified to do that.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.720]   But then even at that,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   you really have to approach that decision
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.040]   more wisely and like you said as an investment
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.440]   versus this is good at any cost
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.960]   because there's plenty of examples
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.260]   where that's just not the case.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.400]   - You also provided advice for what to do at work.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.280]   I don't mean saving in a 401k,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.680]   I mean, how to manage your career.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.860]   And it was even a little chapter in there
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.520]   about how to manage your boss.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.760]   And I started reading that saying,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.380]   manage your boss, what's that about?
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.720]   Maybe you could enlighten us.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.840]   - I think a lot of people just think,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.680]   you can go and work hard and you're going to be rewarded
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.620]   and maybe you will, maybe you're gonna be lucky,
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.680]   but a lot of times that's not the case.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.760]   If you can learn to add value
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.640]   to whatever situation you're in
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.440]   and learn what your employers value
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.920]   and then deliver and even over deliver on those things.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.720]   And then sometimes this can kind of almost seem
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.400]   self promotional or taking too much credit,
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.160]   but you're your own brand.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.200]   If you're doing above and beyond work,
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.080]   then you need to point that out to your employer
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.920]   and you need to maybe set up regular reviews
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.520]   and just things so that they're aware of what you're doing
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.720]   and how you're adding value.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.240]   And that way it doesn't guarantee
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.480]   you're going to be compensated for those efforts,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.880]   but at least you're aware.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.440]   And then if you're not at that employer,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.520]   then you have something objective to go to a new employer
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.600]   and say, look, this is what I've been able to do.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.560]   And again, that is not my idea.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.880]   That was from the blogger,
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.800]   it's called ESI Money is his blog.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.080]   He was the president of a hundred million dollar company.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.960]   And this was his framework that he laid out
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.160]   and we thought it was brilliant.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.600]   And again, I agree it's something I had not seen anywhere.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.280]   And a lot of the things my wife and I did
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.080]   in our own career, in our own house,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.920]   but I've not seen it really put into writing in one place.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.000]   So by being able to take all these people's best ideas
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.560]   and to organize them into one book,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.360]   yeah, I agree that added a tremendous amount of value.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.880]   - Brian Tracy talked about invest 3% of your income
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.200]   in yourself to guarantee your future.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.360]   As I read that, I said, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.520]   Can you dig into what Brian said a little more?
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.880]   - I think one of the things that the FIRE community
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.680]   is criticized for is being hyper frugal,
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.000]   almost to a fault where we don't want
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.640]   to spend money on anything.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.160]   And honestly, there probably is some truth
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.960]   by some people in this community.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.840]   And so what we really want to do
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.080]   is kind of push back a little bit and say,
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.880]   it's not just about cutting your spending,
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.800]   but how can you spend and how can you invest on yourself?
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.840]   And so just some little things,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.360]   and we use an example in the book I know
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.840]   of a guy named Scott Trench,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.360]   who's now I believe is the president at BiggerPockets,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.440]   which is a real estate investing platform.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.760]   But when he was really young,
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.380]   he had the good fortune of being invited
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.600]   to a mastermind group of real estate investors.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.680]   And he started, he just kind of in his head said,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.160]   I'm gonna buy each of these guys lunch
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.480]   and try to just pick their brain if they would let him.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.740]   And they did, and it kind of led
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.400]   to some pretty great opportunities for him
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.640]   from being more comfortable to start investing
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.360]   in real estate competently,
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.100]   to eventually kind of leading to the connection
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.200]   that got him his current job.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.520]   So just little things of thinking differently
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.000]   and investing back into yourself
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.920]   versus trying to save every penny,
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.960]   it can really add up and change your life over the long haul.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.600]   - The book gets into actual investing,
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.640]   putting the money to work.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.740]   And of course, you're an advocate
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.680]   for low cost index fund investing
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.040]   and not trying to go out and pick funds
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.560]   or stocks that are gonna outperform the market.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.120]   One of the things about this chapter,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.920]   though, as I was reading it,
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.440]   invest in index funds and understand the 4% rule,
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.560]   which we'll get to in a minute,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.440]   was as I was reading this,
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.960]   there was so much in there that I had just,
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.440]   was like reading my own life in many ways,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.520]   and all the things that I went through
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.560]   with figuring out what the philosophy
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.000]   of investing should be,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.160]   and how indexing works and why it's better,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.520]   and then going to develop a strategy,
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.120]   and then finally finding the discipline.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.280]   I mean, you have it all in here.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.860]   It's all here, and you did a great job.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.440]   The 4% rule, though, is one thing
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.920]   that I wanted to get to right now,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.620]   which is this idea that you could,
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.220]   at least initially, the Trinity study
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.940]   from a few years ago, which said,
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.220]   "Gee, if you withdraw 4% of your money
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.320]   "out of your account, then you can do that
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.100]   "for the rest of your life and not run out of money,
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.660]   "so get to some level where you can withdraw 4%,"
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.820]   but that has changed recently.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.740]   I mean, the numbers have changed,
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.780]   but you still talk about it in the book.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.700]   - In the FIRE community,
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.300]   I think we're maybe criticized for oversimplifying things,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.220]   and so a lot of times, we'll define financial independence
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.100]   as when you have 25 times your annual expenses,
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.100]   meaning that you could spend 4%.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.220]   I agree that that's not a valid rule,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.300]   that if you're gonna retire in the traditional sense
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.220]   and start drawing down, and particularly
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.660]   for early retirees who have a 50 or 60-year
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.200]   potential timeframe versus a 30-year timeframe
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.180]   that the Trinity study was based on,
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.680]   but I do think it's a great rule to get people started.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.420]   I think it's a great way to shift your mindset
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.740]   from people think to retire, you have to have X percentage
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.340]   of what you earned in your peak earning
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.100]   or your later earning years,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.060]   and this kind of flips that whole thing on its head,
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.260]   and it makes us start focusing on what are you spending,
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.180]   and what is the multiple of your spending,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.860]   and I think that's a much healthier
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.700]   and better place to start from,
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.140]   and then we have people in the FI community.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.420]   One that we feature in the book,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.500]   and he's probably the most prominent is Karsten Jeske,
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.660]   and he writes the blog Early Retirement Now,
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.980]   and he's done a whole series on safe withdrawal rates,
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.380]   and it's just great work,
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.340]   but I think it really does make you change
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.020]   that whole framework to get started,
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.180]   and it also, we talked about like investing fees,
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.020]   and if you assume you can withdraw 4% a year,
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.620]   it makes that one or 2% that you're paying annually
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.380]   in investing fees, it kind of puts some,
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.140]   I guess, context to that.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.300]   When you say, you know, if you can withdraw 4% a year,
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.940]   but you're paying 2% between your fees to your advisor
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.660]   and then fees to the funds,
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.580]   that really only leaves you 2% for yourself,
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.700]   and that makes that 4%,
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.780]   it puts everything into perspective.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.980]   - You talk a lot in the book about investing in index funds
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   and keeping costs low, keeping taxes low, and so forth,
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.940]   and I wanna read something you put in here
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.420]   because it's so true,
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.340]   talking about how Wall Street tries
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.580]   to make everything complex,
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.260]   and I've been saying for a long time
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.380]   that if you're an investment advisor or you're a broker
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.420]   and you make things complex for your clients,
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.900]   you have job security,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.940]   you think you're building job security
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.300]   because they don't understand really what you're doing,
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   so they kind of throw up their hands at one point and say,
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.380]   "Hey, look, you're the expert, I'm trusting you,"
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.900]   and that's exactly what you wanna hear
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.980]   as a financial advisor,
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.060]   but not exactly what you should be saying as an investor.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.900]   And you put in here,
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.020]   "There's a tremendous incentive for the financial industry
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.240]   "to promote feelings of inadequacy, fear,
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.500]   "and confusion in investors,"
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.780]   and that is so true.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.940]   - And that was just from firsthand experience.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.780]   I lived it for, again, a decade,
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.860]   and I felt so overwhelmed,
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.460]   and then eventually, after I took control
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.460]   of my own finances, I talked to my parents,
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.100]   and they kind of were in that same boat,
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.900]   so I kind of had to help them figure things out
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.020]   and get through, but I mean,
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.460]   you see that over and over with everyone who I talk to
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.940]   that you feel like you have to go to the advisor
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.860]   because they are the quote-unquote expert,
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.660]   and they just foster that feeling of dependency,
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.500]   and it's great for them,
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.860]   but it's not great for you as an individual investor,
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.660]   so it kind of goes back to you just have to learn the rules.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.860]   - A lot of young people now are turning towards
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.740]   quote-unquote robo-advisors to invest their money,
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.900]   and I'm talking about Betterment and Wealthfront,
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.460]   and now just Vanguard.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.440]   We heard through an article in Investor News
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.260]   is going to be launching a true online-only robo service,
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.260]   and their fee is going to be undercut everybody, of course,
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.020]   because that's what Vanguard does.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.420]   How do you feel about these robo services?
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.020]   Are they a good thing for people,
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.660]   or do they make things too simple
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.700]   where you end up relying on them?
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.100]   - Yeah, so I mean, I'm not a huge fan,
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.580]   just because I don't have a problem with using an advisor
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.100]   of any sort if they add value,
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.580]   but for me personally, I don't see the value add
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.300]   of a robo-advisor.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.940]   I think what they maybe do is they give a false sense
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.780]   of security because they're using these algorithms
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.880]   that if you follow this, then you're going to do better,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.900]   and frankly, nobody knows what's going to do better
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.260]   in the long term, and what we do know, though,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.340]   is that they're adding a cost,
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.820]   and they'll point out that their cost
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.540]   is maybe a quarter or a half a percent
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.940]   compared to traditional advisors, maybe charge 1%,
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.660]   and so any fee savings are good,
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.340]   but you can just do it yourself,
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.700]   and if you go in with that humble attitude
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.060]   that I don't know what's going to be the optimal portfolio,
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.980]   I know why I'm choosing the portfolio I am,
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.160]   and I'm going to stick with it for the long haul,
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.900]   I don't know that they're going to add any value
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.980]   with the portfolios they're going to put you in,
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.780]   but I do know for certain that it will cost you
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.580]   that extra quarter or a half percent,
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.680]   and again, again, that kind of sounds like a small number,
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.660]   but if you look at it, again, with that concept
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.700]   of maybe the 4% rule, or like we said,
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.020]   maybe that's not valid, maybe it's a 3% rule,
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.220]   and so if you're paying a quarter or a half percent,
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.700]   that's a substantial amount of the income
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.300]   you could potentially live off of,
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.180]   and again, if it's adding value, then great,
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.840]   but I don't see necessarily a great value add
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.700]   that they're providing.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:41.380]   - There are some advisors who point to a study
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.620]   or an opinion piece by Vanguard
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.620]   who says that advisors can add up to 3% alpha
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.140]   in a portfolio, they call it advisor alpha,
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.880]   and they sort of backdoor into this idea
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.500]   that because advisors can change your behavior,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.840]   because they can lower your fees somehow,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.460]   I guess by using index funds,
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.820]   and because they're better at doing investing than you are,
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.820]   that they can add up to 3% alpha to your portfolio.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.980]   How do you feel about that?
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.260]   - So when I started writing,
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.700]   we talked a little bit about my background,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.300]   and so I was very dogmatic that everybody should be
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.500]   a do-it-yourself investor,
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.940]   and then as I started dealing with real-world scenarios,
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   my parents being a great example,
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.160]   readers that call right into the blog
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.580]   and ask me these questions,
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.900]   and I realized there's a lot of complexity
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.500]   in people's situations,
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.300]   and so I do think if you have a complex situation,
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.820]   maybe you had bad advice before
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.980]   and you need to get out of products
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.060]   that aren't in your best interest,
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.300]   if maybe you have a unique circumstance,
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.880]   maybe you have a special needs child or something like that,
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.820]   there are scenarios where I'm certain
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.940]   that an advisor could add value,
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.740]   and then for other people,
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.460]   they're not going to do the simple things that it takes,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.160]   simple rebalancing and things like that,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.440]   so maybe they add some value there,
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.900]   but 3% seems like a lot,
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.060]   and especially across a general population,
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.260]   I have a hard time buying into that.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.540]   - It's possible that advisors might add 3%
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:23.540]   to a small, minuscule number of people,
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.740]   but in general, at least in my practice,
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.300]   and I'm just doing an hourly advisor model now,
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   the people I'm seeing are much, much more ahead than that.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.540]   A good advisor might add a quarter of a percent, maybe,
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.660]   but not three.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.300]   - Yeah, especially on an annualized basis.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.580]   I mean, that's a lot of change.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.180]   - And so one of the battles that I'm fighting
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.020]   is this 1% AUM fee,
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.300]   where if advisors are charging a 1% fee
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.180]   to a million dollar client,
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.780]   and .9 on a two million,
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.420]   and .8 on a three million,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.960]   and it ends up being 10,000, 18,000, $24,000
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.120]   to pretty much just manage a simple index fund portfolio,
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.180]   and then maybe doing some financial planning as well.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.820]   How do you fall on that debate?
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.400]   - So kind of getting away from the book,
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.540]   but kind of on our blog, again,
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.520]   we have a lot of people that write in,
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.780]   and that's generally the advice that we give,
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.960]   is that you find somebody that's fee-only,
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.460]   and that's gonna provide advice on an hourly basis,
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.180]   on an as-needed basis.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.200]   I think that gives you the best chance
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.900]   to have the least conflicts of interest,
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.760]   and then we recommend that you find somebody
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.860]   that is a fiduciary,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.540]   although I do understand that doesn't guarantee anything,
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.660]   but I think that gives you a better chance also.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.420]   And so that's the general advice that we give,
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.980]   but I think in general,
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.060]   finding good financial advice is very challenging,
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.700]   and I think anybody that thinks that they can hand over
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.260]   to anybody under any model and not be a part of this,
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.500]   I think they're in for a rude awakening.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.380]   I think there's just so many conflicts,
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.000]   and it's just really challenging,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.580]   so you have to be invested in the process.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.160]   - I think that's great advice.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.300]   I wanna get into active management,
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.140]   and here's where I just thought
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.780]   you did a fantastic job in the book,
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.320]   'cause it just opened my eyes up to,
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.760]   wow, what a whole new way of looking at active management,
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.160]   because when you start talking about
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.000]   active management in the book,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.200]   you're not talking about investing in index funds
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   versus investing in actively managed funds.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.760]   You describe active management
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.800]   as something quite different than that.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.940]   - Yeah, so I mean, I think a lot of times
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.220]   when you go to a financial advisor,
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.000]   they think in terms of stocks and bonds,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.520]   because that's how they're paid,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.480]   and I think it's extremely difficult
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.080]   to beat the market by investing in the market.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.800]   So I think if you're going to be a stock and bond investor,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.080]   you should probably be an index fund investor
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.240]   for the vast, vast majority of people.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.720]   But I don't think it's impossible to beat the market
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.440]   by investing outside of the market.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.960]   So maybe investing in your own personal business,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.600]   or investing in real estate
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.080]   where you have much more control over
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.760]   getting into a small market
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.680]   where you have a competitive advantage,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.580]   and you can put in some sweat equity,
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.580]   and you can utilize leverage in a relatively safe way.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.320]   And I think for a lot of people,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.200]   if you can't develop a high savings rate
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.500]   like we talked about earlier in the interview,
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.640]   but you still want to become
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.840]   financially independent more quickly,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.960]   again, it kind of goes back to learning the rules
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.680]   and understanding the basic math.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   Investing in index funds may not get you there
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.940]   on the timetable that you want to,
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.480]   so you need to find a different path.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.120]   And so that's where I think investing in your own business
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.120]   and/or investing in real estate,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.920]   either on their own or in combination with index funds,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.360]   that's going to give you a realistic chance
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.720]   to get to where you want to go.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.640]   - And just to clarify,
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   your version of active management is invest in yourself,
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.800]   invest in businesses that you start,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.640]   invest in real estate directly.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.080]   These are the active management things
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.960]   that you could be doing, which would really build wealth,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   as opposed to going out there
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   trying to find active managers in the mutual fund space
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.280]   who you think might outperform the market.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.880]   And I just thought that was a great insight
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.480]   and I completely agree with you on that.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.920]   - Yeah, and I think that kind of goes back
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.220]   to the way we framed it.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.800]   I think we probably will get some pushback
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.960]   because it kind of goes back
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.680]   to that definition of retirement.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.200]   And so we kind of, we just don't really care
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.000]   about that definition of retirement,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.120]   but we kind of look at these as investments.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.000]   And some people will say, well, you're not really retired
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.680]   'cause now you're an entrepreneur.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.640]   You're not really retired because you're a real estate
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.280]   investor and you're out managing properties.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.680]   And certainly there's truth to that.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.480]   But the bottom line is, are you building the lifestyle
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.960]   that you want to live in alignment with your values?
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   And so if you can work a couple of hours a week
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.440]   on a real estate, as a real estate investor,
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.340]   or as on your own business that you set up as a business
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.400]   and not a job where you can step away from it
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.160]   without the business shutting down,
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.600]   I would view that as an investment.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.680]   And people are certainly can feel free to,
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.440]   we can agree to disagree on the terminology around that.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.760]   But I think that that's the way
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.180]   that you can have outsized returns on your money
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.280]   versus trying to roll the dice by taking more risk
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.680]   than you can tolerate or getting into some hedge fund
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.480]   or somebody that wants to take huge fees
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.320]   and promise outsized returns.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.920]   And I just don't think that that's reliable
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.120]   for really anybody and particularly
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.940]   for the vast majority of investors,
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.360]   I would certainly stand behind saying that.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.400]   And I want to get back to something you just mentioned
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.700]   because it's a great line in the book.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:36.500]   Scrap the idea of retirement completely
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   and focus on building lives we don't want to retire from.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500]   I think it was just a great line.
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.100]   That's exactly it, isn't it?
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.900]   That's really what this FI fire movement really is about.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.180]   It's about this whole archaic idea of slaving away
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.620]   until you have enough money to retire.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.620]   If your employer lets you later on down the road,
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.620]   get away from that idea and focus on building a life,
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.580]   not just a job or not just a career,
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.180]   but a life that you don't want to retire from.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.940]   - Yeah, and I normally write at the website,
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.500]   can I retire yet?
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.300]   And I found that blog
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.260]   'cause I was literally asking that question.
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.860]   To me, it was all about retirement
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.020]   and it was all about escaping this career
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.780]   I was not satisfied with.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.660]   So my partner at the site, Derek Kirkpatrick,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.380]   I mean, he's just a really smart and detailed planner.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.380]   And as I really kind of got into
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.900]   what does a traditional retirement entail,
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.660]   I mean, what I realized is,
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.140]   yes, it's going to free me from these things I don't like,
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.500]   having my time dominated by a job is the primary one.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.020]   But now it's going to introduce
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.060]   a whole nother set of stresses where,
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.380]   what is my day-to-day purpose?
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.420]   Where as a physical therapist,
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.460]   I was going in every day and helping people.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.740]   And so how am I going to replicate that in my everyday life?
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.460]   And we talked about, we were savers
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.140]   because we enjoyed that feeling of abundance.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.520]   And if you're drawing down your investments,
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.660]   it's going to be a whole different feeling of scarcity.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.100]   And every day you're stressed about money
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.420]   where money was never a concern.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.620]   So I think a lot of people just oversimplify it
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.260]   and think retirement's going to fix their problems.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.340]   And really you're trading one devil for another.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.820]   And so how I approach it now is,
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:12.700]   how can I get the things
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.380]   that I really wanted from retirement?
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.940]   And so for me, that was time with my young daughter,
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.620]   time to get out and seek adventure with my wife
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.180]   while we're both young and healthy,
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.260]   to having some freedom to just step back
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.480]   and just have some space in my life.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.060]   How can I create that without all the downsides
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.340]   of that scarcity that come with a traditional retirement?
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.100]   And that's really what it's all about.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.900]   - When I was getting into the last chapter now,
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.260]   up to page 300 or so,
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.500]   I ended up drawing this little diagram.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.100]   There's something you might see on a road,
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.260]   a sign that shows you could either go straight
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.340]   or you can take the sharp left-hand turn.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.820]   And there's two arrows, one arrow goes straight
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.900]   and the other one makes the sharp 90 degree left-hand turn.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.300]   And I drew that in the book
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.860]   and I put standard path was the straight line, right?
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.220]   That was the work till 65, get the gold watch.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.180]   That's what we all, at least my generation,
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.380]   was kind of taught.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.820]   And on the left hook, the pivot, if you will,
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.660]   that went 90 degrees the other way,
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.580]   I put choose FI, because to me,
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.020]   that's what it's really all about.
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.940]   It's changing the whole dynamics of the equation.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.380]   - It's really funny that you say that
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.300]   because we kind of went back and forth
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.100]   on how we were gonna title the book.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.540]   And it was between like your blueprint
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.420]   of financial independence versus a roadmap
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.900]   to financial independence.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.700]   And my original vision of the cover was exactly that,
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.300]   like a road sign that has like an arrow
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.340]   that splits in different directions.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.820]   So that's just, it's really,
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.100]   that's a astute and kind of amusing observation
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.660]   that you wrote that, 'cause that's exactly where we were,
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.260]   one of the two ways we were gonna go with this.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.740]   - Well, it was easy to draw that figure
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.900]   because it's exactly what you're talking about in the book.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.740]   I can see it.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.580]   And quite frankly, when I look back at my own life,
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.780]   this is what I did.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.820]   I didn't quite know what I was doing,
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:56.700]   but that's what I did.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.540]   I took the left-hand turn.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.780]   I started my own business when I was 40 years old
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.700]   because I didn't wanna continue to work
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.740]   in the brokerage world where they controlled everything
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.740]   and controlled my destiny.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.220]   I wanted to do it on my own.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.580]   I knew it was a big risk.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:14.060]   My son came up to me in the second year of the business.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.180]   He was a junior in high school and he comes up to me
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.020]   and he's crying.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.860]   And I remember him crying and I'm like,
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.700]   "What's the matter?
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.540]   What's the matter?"
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.860]   He goes, "I can't believe you left this great paying job
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.220]   "to start this business in your living room."
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.540]   Literally, I was sitting in my living room
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.020]   at a desk in our living room where I set up shop.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.020]   I said, "You have to trust me.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   "This is gonna work.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.300]   "You have to believe me.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.140]   "I know what I'm doing.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:33.980]   "This is gonna work.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.420]   "Everything's gonna be just fine."
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.940]   And it was.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.260]   But it is a scary thing.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.460]   It is a scary thing to get off that treadmill, if you will,
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.420]   the hamster treadmill and actually get off of it
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.740]   and take that left-hand turn
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.660]   and choose to do something different
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.660]   and choose to financial independence in a different way.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.700]   Is it gonna work?
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.900]   Yeah, it will work.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.740]   You know why?
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.780]   You're gonna make it work.
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.220]   That's why it's gonna work.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.980]   - I had that exact experience, actually.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.660]   So my dad started, he was an entrepreneur.
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.340]   He was a newspaper photographer
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.180]   and by all means, he was pretty successful,
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.460]   but he just hated it.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.140]   And so he quit and started his own business.
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.940]   And I witnessed the struggles of an entrepreneur.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.020]   And one of the things, again,
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.220]   we talked about investing in your own business
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.180]   and kind of how these concepts all tie together.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.660]   I think a lot of people don't do what you did
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.580]   or what my dad did because they're afraid.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.940]   And it's a healthy fear if, again,
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.260]   if you need that next paycheck
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:30.900]   or you're going to lose your car or lose your house.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.500]   But by embracing these concepts
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.800]   that we talked about earlier in the book
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.340]   with cutting your core expenses
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.220]   and by building up some cushion
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.860]   so you're not paycheck to paycheck,
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.340]   even if you're not financially independent
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.700]   where you can retire, but if you have a year
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.780]   or five years or now 10 years of runway,
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.700]   where's the risk in that?
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.720]   I mean, you have a lot of time to figure things out
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.860]   and to get on the right path.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.300]   And so I think it's going to embolden a lot of people
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.020]   to live into that life that they want to live
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.940]   versus being just stuck in fear.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.860]   And that was really much more of the take-home message
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.420]   than anything about retirement.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:08.140]   - And there's an entire community out there to support you.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:11.660]   I mean, it's called the FI community,
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.540]   which is what this book is all about.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.660]   It's talking about this community of people
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.860]   who are there to help you.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.620]   And they are, I went to FinCon conferences,
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.940]   which are financial blogging podcast conferences.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.700]   I went to the first one when it first came out
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.640]   and I've been to several.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.140]   And it's just a great community of a lot of young people
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.340]   and some older folks like me,
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.020]   over 60 that try to make an appearance,
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.380]   but it's a great community, a support community
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.720]   for people who are looking to do something different,
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.020]   looking to take control of their lives.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.740]   And change their lives for their better,
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.260]   for the better for the children
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.860]   and the better for the grandchildren as well.
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.020]   So this community, the Choose FI community,
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.020]   the FIRE community, it's all good.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.060]   What you've done with this book is really great.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.540]   And if you could just take a few minutes
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:06.540]   to talk about some of the kind of the special people
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.540]   who have helped you write the book
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.420]   and have helped you come to the messages
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.300]   that you've come to the book.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.140]   I know you talked about Brad and Jonathan,
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.420]   and could you just go over your list?
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.380]   - Yeah, so I mean, I think when I originally
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.940]   started writing the book,
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.740]   a lot of those early thought leaders in the FIRE community.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.340]   So going back to like Vicki Robin,
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.820]   but then I think the person that really picked it up
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.020]   and started this whole thing
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.940]   was a guy named Jacob Lundfisker.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.580]   And he wrote, it was called "Early Retirement Extreme"
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.140]   and it lives up to its name, it's pretty extreme.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.500]   And he talks about like an extreme frugality
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.020]   and getting to retirement as quickly as you can.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.380]   But I think people started building off of his ideas
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:52.500]   and Pete who's known as Mr. Money Mustache
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.740]   and his blog is, it's been phenomenally successful.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   And he's kind of taken Jacob's ideas
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.480]   and taken it more to the mainstream.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.500]   And there was kind of that whole core group
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.700]   of kind of that engineer type.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.220]   So Mad Scientist, Go Curry Cracker, Root of Good,
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.520]   I think were the original bloggers there
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.220]   that kind of grew this community.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.740]   And then as far as like investing
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.700]   and linking to the bogleheads,
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.980]   there's a blogger called J.L. Collins.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.180]   And his blog is just called JLCollinsNH.com.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.420]   And he's written a book called "The Simple Path to Wealth."
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.260]   And he was really who introduced me
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.600]   to the idea of index investing.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.220]   And he considers John Bogle one of his heroes.
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.700]   And I started reading his stuff
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.100]   and I started reading Mr. Bogle's work
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.940]   and getting into the bogleheads community.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.640]   And so that was super valuable to me.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.980]   And then there's just a couple bloggers
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.860]   that were kind of out there in front of me.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.900]   Todd Tressiter, who writes at the blog Financial Mentor.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:45.460]   And my partner now at the blog Can I Retire Yet
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.420]   is Daryl Kirkpatrick.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.620]   And I think a lot of people don't even maybe consider
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.400]   those two as part of the FIRE community
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.460]   'cause they're a little bit older
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.140]   and a little bit further out ahead.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.660]   But Todd really was the first person I heard talking about,
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.060]   you know, it's not about retirement.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.500]   And, you know, he called it the pro-leisure circuit
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.200]   where maybe you're gonna go out
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:06.380]   and whatever it is for you, hiking, skiing, traveling.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.460]   And, you know, it's gonna be great for six months.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.280]   And then you're gonna get bored
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.700]   and what are you gonna do next?
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.560]   And for Daryl, my partner now,
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.180]   he just kind of was more even keeled
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.780]   and not extreme and not all about optimization
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.180]   and frugality, but instead like about
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.560]   what really matters to you and how do you design that.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.820]   So all of those people and many, many more
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:26.580]   who've now come behind them
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.040]   and contributed their own stories
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.140]   have all really contributed to the book.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.980]   And when I started writing, I thought that was the story.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.140]   I thought that was the book.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.420]   So all of those people were tremendously influential
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.860]   on my journey and putting that message together in the book.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.820]   - Your two authors, Brad and Jonathan,
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.420]   have a podcast called Choose Fi,
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.500]   which has been extremely successful.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.620]   And a lot of the information in the book
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.780]   comes from those podcasts.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.020]   - They've done a great job at bringing in a lot of voices.
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.900]   And I originally thought that the book
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.100]   really was kind of collecting
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.560]   these original thought leaders and their ideas.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.820]   But what Brad and Jonathan have done a great job of doing
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.540]   is bringing in a lot of different voices
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.140]   and a lot of different perspectives
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.620]   and learning from many different people.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.860]   And then the other thing,
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.180]   even bigger than building the podcast,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.320]   they've really built a community.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.580]   So like when I was starting,
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.380]   we talked about like I was saving 50%.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.580]   And I knew I wanted something different,
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.460]   but I didn't know how to find other people
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.940]   on a similar journey.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.780]   And what they've done is they've created first
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.840]   a Facebook community,
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.220]   and now it's turned into these Choose Fi local communities.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.540]   So like I'm in the Salt Lake City area
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.220]   and every month we get together.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.620]   And it's just a community of people,
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.980]   of like-minded people who you can support one another
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.060]   and learn from one another.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.300]   And that's just so valuable
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.400]   when you're trying to do something
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.160]   that's so different from what you're seeing every day.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.500]   And I think that's just tremendously life-changing
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.740]   to have that support group
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.020]   and people can find them wherever they're at in the country
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.900]   and kind of build it into whatever you want it to be.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.840]   And having a place where people can go and meet up
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.740]   on a local level and support one another, it's phenomenal.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.680]   - The book is called Choose Fi,
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.020]   Your Blueprint to Financial Independence.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.340]   Chris, Brad and Jonathan did a fantastic job with this book,
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.680]   highly recommend it for everyone.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.920]   I learned a tremendous amount
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.440]   and I've been around for a while
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.740]   and I've read a lot of books.
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.840]   And sometimes when you pick up a book,
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.880]   you think you're gonna read the same old things
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.700]   over and over again.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.400]   I'll tell you, I learned an awful lot from your book, Chris,
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.800]   and I really appreciate you being on the show.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.920]   - I really appreciate you having me,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.800]   and that means a lot coming from you.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.080]   So I'm quite honored to hear that.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.960]   - This concludes the 14th episode
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.400]   of Bogleheads on investing.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.540]   I'm your host, Rick Ferry.
