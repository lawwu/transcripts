[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   If you're helping someone who's just turning 18,
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.660]   you're helping someone who's moved to the U.S.,
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.760]   first option is a secured credit card.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.520]   This is a credit card that requires a deposit.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.540]   That deposit is, of course, refundable,
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.200]   but then it gives access to spend.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.420]   Important distinction is it is not a prepaid card.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.160]   It's similar, but you can take the money out much more easily.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.840]   And so this is a great option.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.980]   Another option is a student card.
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.220]   Note that for both of these kinds of cards,
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.140]   anyone under 21 will probably need to have proof of income
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.080]   or a co-signer to get approved.
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.920]   Some popular cards for people with little to no credit.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.280]   Chase student cards,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.480]   but they sometimes need a little bit of history
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.280]   on your credit report.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.480]   But Discover secured cards, easy.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.860]   Some Barclays cards have been pretty easy.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.780]   Surprisingly, Amex cards are quite easy
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.680]   and they do pre-approvals on their website.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.000]   This seems counterintuitive
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.040]   because they're usually more premium cards.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.140]   And I have seen so many au pair mailers
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.040]   offering Amex Gold, Amex Platinum pre-approvals,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.540]   even with very little credit data,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.100]   if not any credit data,
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.480]   they're getting some of these pre-approvals.
