[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Pastor John, was C.S. Lewis a Christian hedonist?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.360]   Joy led Lewis to Christ as the supreme object of his joy and the supreme source
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.480]   of his joy. So if we're asking the question, "What's the function of joy in
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.160]   Lewis and does it lead to Christian hedonism?" my resounding answer is going
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.720]   to be the function of joy was massive and yes it leads to Christian hedonism. I
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.760]   think I learned crucial elements of my Christian hedonism from Lewis. He called
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.720]   his autobiography "Surprised by Joy." That's a massive choice that he made to tell us
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   that what he was experiencing during his 30 unbelieving years in this thing he
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   called the inconsolable longing, used the German word "Sehnsucht." What he was
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.480]   experiencing there, this northerness, was ephemeral and always disappointing,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.720]   disappearing. As soon as you tried to grasp it, keep it, make it your god, it
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.440]   went away. He wrote this really famous line, "If I find in myself a desire which
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.640]   no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.360]   was made for another world." Well that's a description of the discovery it took him
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.160]   30 years to get to, because he was constantly having these desires and he
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.840]   called them joy. He called these the stabbings, these breaking ends of
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.480]   something he knew not what, and the longing was the joy, and it was so
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.000]   intense he wanted it so bad, and yet it went away. And so he finally says in
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.240]   his story of his conversion, "Inexorably," this is a quote, "Inexorably, joy
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:16.960]   proclaimed, 'You want.' I myself am your want of something other, outside, not you
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.880]   nor any state of you." In other words, that's what he finally came to, is that my
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.160]   desire is pointing beyond my desire, and if I don't discover the God beyond my
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.200]   desire, the true God who awakens all my desires, who satisfies all my desires, I
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.360]   will live an endlessly frustrated life. So there was a quest for joy,
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.600]   which became a quest for the object of the joy so that the joy could be
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.760]   satisfied. That's how he became a Christian. So you can't overstate
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.400]   for Lewis the redemptive effect of joy in his life, and that, and the next stage
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   for me in my own discovery, was to realize that it didn't just bring him to
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:13.120]   Christ. Joy remained, in Lewis's way of thinking, as a virtue behind all our good
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.400]   deeds. I remember, Tony, standing at a square specials book table in Vroman's
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.240]   bookstore, fall of 1968, on Colorado Avenue in Pasadena, California, looking
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.560]   down at a little blue paperback called "The Weight of Glory," author C.S. Lewis. I
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   never picked it up in my life. I picked it up, opened, and read the first page, and
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:53.280]   the impact of that page on my Christian hedonism is huge, because that's the page
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   where he basically says, "Every body is questing and pursuing joy, and the
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.840]   problem," he said, "is not that we are pursuing happiness, but that we are far
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.680]   too easily pleased." And I thought, "Yes! Yes! That's right! The problem is not that I
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.280]   want to be happy. The problem is that I'm settling on happinesses that are," to use
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.640]   his language, "like a little child making mud pies in the slum, because he can't
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.400]   imagine what a holiday at the sea is like." I tell you, that sentence, Tony, was just
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.520]   explosively illuminating for me, and became part of the ground of the last 40
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.920]   plus years of my life's work. So that's—yes, he was a Christian hedonist. And
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.600]   one last piece. I forget when I read it. I think I read it a year or two later, his
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.960]   book "Reflections on the Psalms," and at the time I was wrestling with how
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.840]   God-centered God seemed to be in the Bible, and I was being shown by Edwards
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.760]   and shown by Dan Fuller, and all over the Bible, that God was God-centered. And
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.360]   in his chapter on—I forget, something like a word on praise or something—he
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.600]   talked about his own struggle with God's self-exaltation, and he said it sounded
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.240]   like an old woman seeking compliments. "Praise me! Praise me! Praise me! Praise me!"
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.120]   It seemed to him that God was saying all over the Psalms, and He is. And then he
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.040]   gives these two pages—I think it's pages 92 and 93, I didn't even check it because I
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:51.640]   just—I remember it so well from those days—that praise is not the constrained,
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.360]   dutiful add-on to delight. So you delight and say, "Oh, I guess I should praise it
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   because it's so beautiful." Nobody, nobody does that. If you love something, if you
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.840]   delight in something, it spontaneously overflows, and isn't that beautiful? Can
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   you believe that? And you point, and you hope that somebody is standing at your
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.360]   side. I remember standing, reading the jokes in the New Yorker, in the library,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.200]   at Fuller Seminary, and laughing quietly and wishing I could point to it with
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.440]   somebody, and that confirmed that Lewis is right, that I want to praise this joke
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.560]   right here, I want to praise this cartoon right now. My joy in this cartoon will
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.760]   not be complete until I find somebody and say, "Look, look, look at this!" And he
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   argued that when God calls us to praise, He is calling us to bring our delight to
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.720]   consummation, which means it's not egomania, it's love. And that was the
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.440]   capstone for me, it was just a capstone to believe that God's requirement that I
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.700]   praise Him was an act for me, it was for me. He gets the glory, I get the
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:19.560]   consummation of the joy that I have in Him. So Lewis is a profound influence in
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.440]   my shaping of what I've called Christian hedonism, and I'll just thank God for Him
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.800]   until I see Him face to face, and can thank both Him and the Father that He
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.120]   let me bump into Him in my young years. Thank you, Pastor John. We will be
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.440]   studying the enduring influence of C.S. Lewis later this fall on September 27, 28,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.320]   and 29 here in Minneapolis at the Desiring God National Conference. The
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.040]   conference is titled "The Romantic Rationalist--God, Life, and Imagination in
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.500]   the Work of C.S. Lewis." More details and registration will be available soon at
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.840]   desiringgod.org on the blog and under the "Events" tab. I'm your host Tony
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.960]   Reinke, thanks for listening.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.720]   you
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.780]   you
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:14.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
