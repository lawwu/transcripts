[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.480]   This episode was hosted by the Bogleheads Starting Out Life Stage Chapter and recorded
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.420]   January 31st, 2024.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.940]   It features blogger, The Mad Scientist discussing financial independence while becoming a recent
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.320]   parent and homeowner.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.920]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.120]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800]   investment advice.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   For folks not familiar with your blog or podcast series, can you just give a brief intro about
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   yourself?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800]   Sure.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.480]   I started The Mad Scientist back in 2012.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.880]   Prior to that, I had always been really good with money and always interested in money
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.400]   and very frugal naturally in saving money.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.120]   When I got a good job, I didn't really know what I was going to do with it until I stumbled
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.240]   upon a blog called Get Rich Slowly and I was like, "Yeah, that's what I want to do."
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.760]   And then a few years into reading that, I then found Early Retirement Extreme and that
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.960]   just changed everything because I'm not big into possessions or material things.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.840]   So I didn't really know what I was going to do with the money I was saving for all those
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   years.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.680]   And then reading that just blew my mind because I was like, "Oh, retirement's not an age.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.080]   It's just a math equation with your expenses and your income in that equation."
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.200]   So I was just all in on that idea.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.120]   I started The Mad Scientist because I'm also naturally a bit lazy, so I sort of needed
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.240]   external motivation to do the research that I knew I could do to get to FI quicker.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.400]   But I knew that I would probably want to do it if it was just me doing it.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.560]   So I was like, "Well, I'll start a blog," and then having the need to put out content
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.680]   would force me to research the stuff that I thought would make me reach FI faster.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.760]   And at the time, I thought that I was going to be some master investor.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.920]   But pretty quickly into my research, I pretty much fell into the bobo head's way of doing
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.240]   things and realized, "Well, there's not really too much optimization I'm going to be doing
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   on that front."
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.320]   So then that eventually led into sort of like tax optimization for early retirees and people
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.520]   pursuing early retirement.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.640]   And that's sort of what made my blog what it is today, I guess, the popularity in those
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.080]   early days with a lot of that tax optimization stuff specifically for five people.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.960]   And at the same time, I also started a podcast because I wanted an excuse to talk to people
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.360]   who did what I wanted to do.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.760]   So just dumb luck, my very first guest was Mr. Money Mustache because he was a software
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.040]   developer like me, and I was like, "Well, I want to talk to a software developer who's
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   done it."
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.000]   And that happened to be one of his first interviews that he ever did, and it was my very first
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   interview.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.880]   But then obviously he exploded and then brought me up with them because when people would
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.560]   Google Mr. Money Mustache, my podcast would come up, and then that's sort of how that
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.120]   took off.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.920]   And I started that back in 2012 as well.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.920]   So all these things have been going for a while, but I'm not very prolific.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.120]   So there's still like less than 100 episodes, even though I've been doing it for 12 years.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.000]   But yeah, I think that's probably a good summary for now.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Okay.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Thanks for that.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.800]   And I mentioned this earlier, I think in terms of the quality of your stuff, folks would
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.680]   probably take quality over quantity any day.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.360]   So folks who aren't familiar with Brandon's blog or podcast, we highly encourage you to
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   check it out.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.280]   And I'll also add that Brandon's been a guest on other podcasts, so that it's not just him
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.560]   interviewing, sometimes the tables are turned, and it's not limited to personal finance.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.480]   There's a lot of self-improvement in the space.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.400]   So James Clear, author of the very popular Atomic Habits, was one of your guests, which
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.960]   is pretty amazing, right?
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.120]   He's like a personal hero for a lot of folks.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:16.920]   So fast forward now, Brandon, you've been FI for a long time, and some major life events
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.320]   very recently that Miriam touched on.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   So why don't we start with parenting, how's that been?
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.880]   And on the blog, you mentioned that years ago, you never envisioned having a kid or
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.720]   even that you didn't want a kid.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.400]   So can you talk a bit about the transition from not wanting a kid to having a kid and
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.760]   how FI was a part of that decision?
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.720]   Yeah, it was a huge part of it, actually, because in my 30s, I was very focused on doing
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.560]   a lot of things that I had always wanted to do.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.000]   I'd set out to do big goals, personal goals, and FI being one of them, and just lots of
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.640]   different fields, really, just things that I thought I'd always wanted to do.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.600]   So the thought of having kids, especially when I was still working, was just like, how
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.440]   could that, I don't know how I would juggle all that.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   So it seems, looking back, it was just a selfish thing back then.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.680]   But it wasn't just that, because I just never saw myself as having kids.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.440]   So it was like, why would I give away all this free time that I really need to do all
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.160]   these things I really want to do, when I don't even really want the end result?
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.880]   So it was only since we started having nieces and nephews and started becoming a big part
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.000]   of their lives and seeing them grow up that I was like, "Whoa, kids are actually really
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.120]   fun and they're crazy."
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.000]   And yeah, I started coming around to the idea.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.760]   And my wife was always more into it than I was.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.000]   And then as we started getting older, she really settled on the fact that, yeah, she
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.960]   definitely wanted to be a parent.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   And so after FI, I was like, "Okay, this is actually doable now, because I do have
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.000]   time to do all this stuff that I'm wanting to do."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.320]   But then I could also, yeah, potentially not have as much free time and still be able to
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.640]   cope with it.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.880]   And then only over the past maybe two or three years, once, thanks to FI, I was able to accomplish
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.520]   a lot of the things that were on that list of things that I was really wanting to accomplish,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.560]   but not only was I okay with the idea, but I really wanted to do it and to have kids
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.520]   because, yeah, I felt like I'd done all the things I wanted to do, and then I sort of
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.960]   wanted to start living vicariously through a little person and sharing all these things
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   with them.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.840]   So, yeah, it's been a really great change, and I'm glad we did it the way we did it,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.480]   because I think I would have been super stressed out had we had a kid 10 years ago, whereas
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.200]   now it's just like, yeah, just absolutely loving it even more than I would have expected.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.920]   And yeah, FI plays a huge part in that.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.760]   I don't know how working parents do it, or single working parents, it just blows my mind.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.120]   We're exhausted enough, and our time is consumed enough without having full-time jobs to worry
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   about as well.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:30.000]   So, yeah, it's been a complete 180 in the best possible way, and yeah, couldn't be more
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   happy with the decision to go ahead and do it.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Excellent.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.080]   So, I'm sure you prepared a lot.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.480]   I know that folks say it's impossible to fully prepare for parenting, so can you share some
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.360]   of the surprises, both good and bad, and some of the things that preparing made so much
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.640]   easier, and then what would it have been hard to prepare for no matter what?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.200]   Yeah, so my normal way of having a spreadsheet for everything and preparing and running all
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.600]   the different scenarios and numbers, I didn't do that with this, because I really had no
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   idea what to expect.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.840]   So, I've sort of been winging it and just hoping my wife knows better than I do in the
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.280]   cases where I don't really know what I'm doing, because it was like a week before our son
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.080]   was due, and I was like, I read books on everything, and I haven't read one parenting book.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   I feel so underprepared, and she's like, you'll be fine, we'll just do it, and it'll be great.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.880]   And so far, so far it has.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.960]   I think I did read one parenting book since then, I can't even remember if I learned anything.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.880]   But yeah, it's been weird in the sense that, yeah, my normal method of just overanalyzing
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:50.160]   and overpreparing hasn't been the case for this.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:59.000]   I would say we spend less as parents, which was maybe a surprise, since going out to eat
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.840]   is often more hassle than it's worth these days and things like that, and trips are exhausting.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.480]   So when you get done with one trip, you're not immediately planning the second one like
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:14.360]   I was when we were single, and not single, but childless in our 20s and 30s, and just
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.240]   planning the next trip as soon as we landed.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:23.280]   So yeah, it's a little bit more exhausting, which is why home ownership, I guess, is feeling
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.640]   so great right now, because we have a really nice home to go back to, and we're loving
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.560]   it, and definitely nesting more than we were at any other point in our lives.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.760]   So yeah, I'd say that's maybe the biggest surprise, because you hear how expensive kids
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   are.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.800]   And yeah, I've found the opposite so far.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.880]   Well, yeah, we don't have to pay for daycare, which I think is the primary cost for a lot
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   of working parents.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.480]   But yeah, everything else has been, I would say, we're spending less these days, because
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.640]   we're just homebodies and doing things in our local neighborhood, because it's much
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.080]   easier to throw them into a stroller and walk around somewhere than it is to do anything
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.320]   more major than that.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.200]   That's so interesting, because I was wondering, let's say a lot of bogleheads are naturally
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   frugal.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.040]   You mentioned you're a natural saver.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.240]   But then I was wondering if having a kid, suddenly there's this inherent change, like
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.360]   you want what's best for your kids, and is there some instinct to shower the kid with
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   every possible thing?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:33.160]   And do we equate expensive with best, and is there a shift in the FI mindset or the
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.240]   frugal mindset once you have kids?
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.640]   There is a little bit, but I know stuff doesn't bring happiness, something I've learned throughout
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   my entire life.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.760]   So we don't shower him with anything really, but that's because we also have crazy grandparents
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.080]   that don't stop showering him with stuff, no matter how much we ask them to stop.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.280]   So we haven't bought him anything.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.320]   But it has shifted my mindset as far as having a really nice, safe place to live.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   I'm not a car guy.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   I hate cars.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.480]   We have a Honda Jazz that's a 2012 Honda Jazz that I bought for three grand, and it's been
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.680]   great since we bought it.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:19.120]   But we're going to need a bigger car, and I think I'll probably spend more than I normally
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.280]   do, which is $3,000 to $5,000 on some used car, because I think I'll just buy a newer
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.680]   one with more safety features, and whether or not that actually matters, that's one way
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.760]   that I feel like I've changed in my mindset, where it's like, "Okay, well, we have the
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:43.320]   money I can spend to get a newer car that has a higher safety rating, and that'll make
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.780]   me feel better when I'm driving it."
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.000]   But besides that, those are the only two things.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.160]   It's like, yeah, a nice place to live and have him grow up, and then yeah, just a safer
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   car.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:02.200]   But no, no desire to buy him fancy clothes or all these toys or big things for the front
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.800]   yard or anything like that, so far, anyway.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.000]   It's great to hear kids do not have to be super expensive.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.560]   I think that challenges a lot of the societal mindset.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.600]   So it's a good segue into this other huge life event.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:23.200]   You were, a long time ago, a homeowner, and in a lot of your blogs and podcasts, you talk
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:32.480]   about renting, and sometimes there's a strong argument against buying, which is counterculture,
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.000]   at least in America, a lot of people are encouraged to buy.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.320]   So can you share how you went from renting to buying, and if you can recap for folks
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.440]   who aren't familiar with the case against buying?
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   Sure.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:56.280]   So we owned a house, we bought a house back in 2004, 2005.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.000]   We were right out of college, didn't have any money.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.240]   I think we had a 95% mortgage, and we borrowed some money off of my wife's parents, or my
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.840]   girlfriend at the time, not wife, for some of the down payment and things like that.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.440]   So we were totally unprepared for a house at that stage, but we got super lucky.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.120]   We did it up a little bit.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.600]   So I guess it was a live-in flip before I knew that that was a thing, but we did it
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   up while we lived there.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.520]   And then we sold it in 2007, right as the whole financial world was collapsing.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.920]   So we ended up making 50% on that house in two and a half years.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:39.000]   So that was a big thing for us when we were in our early 20s.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.040]   So that was a good learning experience.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.320]   We did a lot of maintenance and things, and did the fixing up ourselves.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.400]   Then we bought another house in Vermont in 2011, I believe, and we only stayed there
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.840]   until 2014.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   We took a little bit of a loss on that.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.640]   We thought we would make money because the whole financial real estate market and everything
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:09.360]   collapsed, and we figured we were buying on a good price, but still went down a little
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.360]   bit by the time we sold.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   But that was when I was super frugal, super into FI, and I was just like every penny was
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.960]   just going to my savings investment because I wanted to hit FI as soon as possible.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:30.520]   So as I was saying to Miriam before we started the chat here, I don't think I should have
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.960]   been a homeowner until now, to be honest, because I was so hyper-focused on FI that
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.860]   any unexpected expense just stressed me out completely.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.760]   So having a home that has loads of unexpected expenses was not probably good.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.280]   So this is the actual first time I'm enjoying being a homeowner.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:57.660]   So we just bought a house last year, and I love it.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.780]   I still am not good at maintenance and things.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.080]   So luckily Jill, my wife, takes care of that.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:10.300]   So I can't handle when unexpected things happen and I need to deal with them.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.700]   Like I said before, I like planning, and I like having some sort of structure and stuff.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.860]   So if something comes out of left field, then I'm like, "I just can't do anything."
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:28.220]   So luckily Jill doesn't mind calling plumbers and things if we need something fixed.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:34.560]   So I'm not handy at all, and I have no desire to learn those skills, to be honest.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:41.780]   Maybe someday I will, but there's a lot of other things I'd much rather be working on.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:48.100]   So I'm not a great homeowner, but I'm enjoying this time way more than the other two times.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.340]   And yeah, renting was great.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.420]   Renting allowed us to live in Edinburgh for a lot cheaper than we would have had we tried
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.760]   to buy.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.440]   We got to experience lots of different parts of Edinburgh as renters.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.220]   We saved a lot of money on our travels because we would just move out of our rental and then
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.220]   travel for three months.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.300]   So travel wasn't an additional expense.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.780]   It was just another form of living expenses, which usually was a lot lower than living
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.420]   in Edinburgh because we were in Southeast Asia or something.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.540]   So yeah, I think renting's a fantastic option.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.380]   In Scotland, it's great because they're not all furnished rentals, but there's a lot of
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.740]   furnished rentals.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.480]   So we haven't owned furniture since we sold our Vermont house in 2014.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:40.540]   So yeah, all of our assets are pretty much invested, so those have just all been growing
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.500]   and we're only now accumulating stuff in the house.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.820]   So I think, yeah, I think renting is still a great option for a lot of different people
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:57.060]   and it certainly was for us, but I am happy to have splurged and that's what I consider
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.060]   it.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   It's not, it's like a splurge.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.340]   This is me using the savings I built up to have a splurge on something that I'm really
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.500]   enjoying and we are really enjoying it, so it's been great.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.660]   So should folks who are considering buying reframe this idea of a house as an investment
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:20.580]   versus, I mean, the classic line is rent is throwing money away versus building equity.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.220]   Are there things people should rethink about that?
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.820]   Rent is not throwing money away.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.820]   You're getting shelter.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.140]   That's like saying food is throwing money away because you just eventually flush it
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.860]   all down the toilet at some point and it's like, well, no, you're getting nutrients and
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.380]   things that you need to live and that's what housing is.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.460]   You need shelter to stay warm and safe and yeah, be able to sleep at night comfortably.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   So it's not throwing money away.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.060]   That's the, that drives me crazy when I see that on, on the internet places.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:59.740]   I'm like, yeah, it's no more throwing money away than buying food.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:07.780]   So I'm sorry, I forget the first part of your question cause I was so, so the, the kind
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:14.260]   of trade-off analysis people think they should be building equity and think they minimize
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:22.900]   the value of rent or yeah, the cost of maintaining, yeah, and which Corey, you'll know this more
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:30.660]   than I will cause you're obviously more, you have more experience in real estate, but yeah,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.060]   the cost of maintaining it and then the opportunity costs of the capital that you have locked
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:41.100]   up in that now, since I have a house now, I've been keeping track of the spreadsheet
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.680]   just cause I really want people to understand that.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.860]   So hopefully in 10 years, I'll be able to write a post where I'm like, yeah, this house
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.860]   has been great.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.980]   And yeah, it looks like I've made a lot of money cause it went from X to Y, but really
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.820]   if that money had been where it was before, which is in the markets, I would have this
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.820]   much money.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.140]   I would have actually cost myself probably, you know, multiple six figures for this decision.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:10.420]   So yeah, the opportunity cost of having that capital deployed in something that's not productive
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.220]   in the sense that it's not making money or growing or compounding it, it is giving it's
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:20.380]   productive in the sense that it's giving you shelter, but yeah, I think renting is an amazing
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.620]   option and yeah, like you look into the, the like average returns of real estate over the
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:31.540]   last a hundred years or whatever, and it's fairly above inflation and yeah, you could
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:36.620]   get, you could get lucky if you buy into a hot market or you could obviously increase
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:43.220]   your return by doing work on the house and extend, extending it or improving it.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.220]   So you can do that.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.740]   And then if you do enjoy that kind of work, then that's maybe a good use of your time
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   and effort.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:55.020]   But, but yeah, real estate in general, isn't an amazing investment, especially if you're
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.580]   living in it, that you're not getting any rent from it.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.980]   But it's a fantastic splurge if you're like me and you're in your forties now and you
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.020]   have a new son and you just want to settle down and have nice things at home cause you're
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.980]   too tired to go anywhere else then it's fantastic.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.980]   Excellent.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.020]   So, and how about for the, the more qualitative stuff, whether buying or renting, how's the
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.220]   community, a lot of Bogleheads who retire or whether FI people talk about, you know,
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.980]   using the social structure from their work or meaning, do you know your neighbors?
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.180]   Do you know other parents of toddlers?
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.180]   How's that been?
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.580]   So that's, that's a perfect example of why this has been such a good decision for us.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.580]   We're in this nice little village.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:43.060]   There's like a leisure center right up the road with the pool and play soft play and
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.060]   all this stuff.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:49.220]   And we know all our neighbors where we didn't know anyone in Edinburgh.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.460]   Jill knows all the other moms at the mom groups who she goes to and she's constantly meeting
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:00.780]   up at the park with people and yeah, so that's, that's a huge part of why we're so happy with
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.780]   our decision.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:09.060]   And yeah, we can walk to his future primary school and we're getting to know all his classmates
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.940]   already and they're only like one.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.220]   So it's it's fantastic in that sense.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:20.060]   And yeah, and like we were renting in this village before and we were quite happily renting
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.940]   because we're like, that'll allow us to take our time with buying and it's great for now.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.700]   We know we want to live in this village, but we're happy just renting.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.820]   And then the owner said she wanted to come back in like three months.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.420]   So we were pretty much kicked to the curb.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.860]   So rent renting, there's that risk.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.300]   And when we were young and we were in Edinburgh, we, we didn't care.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.300]   We're like, fine.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   We'll find another place in Edinburgh.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:48.300]   But now with a kid, obviously we want to maintain our place in the community here or there.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.620]   I'm in the States right now, but maintain our, you know, friendships there.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:22:01.100]   And yeah, obviously owning allows you to, to lock that in really.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.700]   Grow some roots.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.260]   So I was considering saving this question for the end, but I feel like I want to transition
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.820]   to an update on your spending.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.940]   So I'll ask you this question now, you know, how you ask your podcast guests, what's the
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.100]   one piece of advice you'd give to those pursuing FI?
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.500]   I'll ask you, what's the one piece of advice you'd give to folks considering parenting?
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.260]   And similarly, the main piece of advice you'd give to homebuyers.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.780]   Oh, okay.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:37.540]   Well, yeah, considering parenting yeah, I guess just no, you'll never be ready and you'll
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.260]   never feel ready even when you're in the midst of it, I think.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.900]   I always thought, yeah, I wasn't ready and I needed to wait until I was ready, I guess.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.100]   But yeah, you're never fully prepared.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.380]   So yeah, just take the plunge and you'll figure it out as you go.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.880]   And really all they care about is time and love.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.220]   So I don't think you need to worry about like all the fancy stuff and getting all the gear.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.100]   I, yeah, I would just say, yeah, you'll never fully be ready.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.740]   So just take the plunge if you think that's something you want to do.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:21.380]   And for homeowners, yeah, it's really, that's tough because I would say try it out first.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.500]   Like I think renting in the place where you want to buy is a great option if it's not
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   a huge hassle.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.580]   Like in Scotland, we rented a three bed, two bed bath house that was fully furnished in
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.420]   the same village we wanted to live in.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.940]   And then we fell in love with it and then we knew we wanted to live there.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.420]   So I think that is a good option.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.740]   And like with Airbnbs, like it could be a month and still not be an expensive month,
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.460]   I guess, compared to a long-term rental.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:54.020]   But that's the beauty of Airbnbs is you can really try it out, which is something that
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:24:01.140]   we're doing on this side of the Atlantic for potentially maybe having a mountain house
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.000]   somewhere here in the next 10 years or something.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.580]   But rather than put that off for 10 years, we're doing Airbnbs and trying it out and
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.700]   hopefully if we do find somewhere we really love, then we'll know that's where we want
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.700]   to go.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   And if we don't, we'll just keep doing Airbnbs and testing.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.900]   So yeah, I think that's a really good option to make sure you want to be there for the
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.580]   long-term before you take that plunge.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.840]   And then the numbers do matter for real estate.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.400]   So if I was still on the journey to FI, then I would be running comparative numbers between
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.060]   renting and buying like crazy.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.980]   But for this purchase, this was the first one that it was a splurge and it was a lifestyle
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.420]   decision, not a financial decision.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   Excellent.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.420]   Great to hear.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.120]   Yeah, it reminds me of a few things.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:57.580]   One is last we spoke with the Bogleheads, you suggested for people considering FI that
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.780]   they also try out things before they retire.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.240]   So it's kind of similar to how you're describing home buying before you do it.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.100]   And then when you mentioned all kids care about is time and love, it reminded me of
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.820]   something your mom said in the Raising Money Smart Kids podcast that you did, which I recommend
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.140]   to folks if they haven't heard it yet.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.360]   She said, you don't have to shower or show love with things, you can show it with time.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.940]   So I thought that was really beautiful.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.540]   That's funny.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.140]   She's right next door and the amount of stuff she's bought my son on this trip is unbelievable.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.380]   So I'm going to have to play that for her because she's out of control.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.380]   That's funny.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.380]   Some things are so much easier said than not done.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.120]   So big update.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.100]   You've had Ramit on the podcast twice at least, and we've spoken about how he's somewhat of
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.620]   an anti-mustachian or we can think of him that way to a certain extent.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.700]   And you mentioned you were working on spending more.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.780]   And I'm excited for us to talk about it because it definitely resonates with a lot of bogal
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:08.060]   heads who can't help but save and accumulate these huge nest eggs.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:14.420]   But it's also, I want to hear about it from you holistically because there's this mindset
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:20.020]   that people think frugal people are denying themselves of happiness or experiences, which
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.900]   may be the case, but for a lot of people, they buy whatever they want, they experience
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.580]   whatever they want, but their needs and wants are so simple, they're not denying themselves
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.580]   of anything.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.700]   So how do you navigate that spectrum?
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:39.220]   Yeah, it's been a really interesting transition because I'm so naturally frugal, but I'm also
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:45.180]   good enough at math to know that if I don't start spending more than the portfolio will
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:54.300]   get pretty much out of control with hitting that exponential curve with the compounding.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:01.140]   So it's been a really interesting journey, I guess, and Ramit's been a huge part of it.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:07.300]   Ramit, and then a book, Die With Zero, which I don't agree with all of that's in there,
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:13.540]   but he makes a lot of good points about there's certain phases in your life.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:19.700]   So going back to my ski mountain house example, yeah, I could just save and save and save
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:25.780]   for the next 10, 15 years and buy the perfect mountain house, but I'll be in my late 50s
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:30.820]   then and maybe I won't want to ski as much as I do now and maybe my son will be too cool
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.500]   to hang out with me and he won't want to ski, you know what I mean?
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.980]   So rather than do that, like, yeah, I can focus because I like planning for the future.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:46.780]   That's fun, I like looking forward to something, but I don't want to delay fun until the future
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.300]   like I did when I was saving for FI, where I was like, okay, yeah, I'll be happy when
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.160]   I reach FI.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.500]   So it's like a nice balance where it's like, okay, yeah, still sort of planning for this
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.420]   very future, but I'm also living that now in a smaller way.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.220]   So tomorrow we're flying to Boston and we're going to have a ski weekend with friends up
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.340]   at Stowe and we're going to be looking around at mountain towns in Vermont because we used
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:20.460]   to live in Vermont and it's like, well, maybe we can maybe have a mountain house there.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.100]   Maybe that's where we'll spend winters for the next few years or whatever.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.020]   So it's balancing that.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.940]   So I agree.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:35.140]   I don't feel like I'm restricting myself or depriving myself of happiness, but I also
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:40.140]   can see Ramit's side of it where he thinks I'm not pushing myself enough to even try
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.020]   things because it is really still hard.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:49.900]   To give you an example, we were planning to do a month ski trip this time and then a few
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.900]   family things happened.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.260]   So we're not going to do the full month, so we're actually just going to do a week in
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:02.220]   Vermont and I booked a really splurgy house for the weekend because I have friends coming
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.500]   up and we're meeting them and it's a fraction of what I had planned to spend for this whole
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   month.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.060]   So the money doesn't matter in that sense, but man, it was hard to pull the trigger and
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:21.500]   it's been hard to think about what I'm spending for two nights in a place where I'm always
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.380]   looking for the best deal.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:29.700]   So I can see Ramit's side of it too, where I'm naturally frugal and I could have an okay
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.340]   weekend with friends or I could have an amazing weekend with friends and financially it doesn't
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:38.940]   really matter because I'm not crazy and I'm not going to go and start getting a private
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.420]   jet or something and I'm not going to blow through my whole savings because it would
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.780]   be impossible for my brain to do that.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:52.500]   So financially it doesn't matter, but it's sort of just letting go a little bit.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.060]   I feel like I've made a lot of progress in the sense that I don't stress about little
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:04.140]   transactions as much and I do spend freely because I realize I'm a middle-class guy and
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:10.860]   my most extravagant middle-class life in my head isn't going to be that much money.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:16.700]   So I can live the most extravagant, buy as many burritos when I'm out as I can because
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.780]   it's a $10 or $15 burrito, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:25.420]   It's not like I'm going out and getting a case of caviar and country clubs or anything
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.060]   because that's a whole other world and I don't particularly want to be in that world.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:35.580]   I'm happy with all my friends are middle-class, my family's middle-class and it's what I'm
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:41.140]   comfortable in and it's like, yes, I could maybe spend and start spending like I'm in
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.980]   the upper echelons of society, but I don't have the desire to do that.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:51.900]   So it's allowed me to just live the most extravagant middle-class life, which has been super fun
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.300]   because it's like, yeah, I'm out and I'm getting a fancy coffee and then I'm getting a pastry
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:01.540]   and then I'll get lunch and then most of the time I'm at home so I'm not spending any money.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.820]   So it really hasn't moved the needle too much.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.660]   So I can see it from both sides.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:13.460]   So I agree that as a naturally frugal person, I don't feel like I'm really depriving myself
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.100]   of a lot of things, but I can also see it from Ramit's side of things and be like, there's
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.900]   a lot more other really interesting experiences you could have if you just push yourself a
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.900]   little bit.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.900]   Excellent.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.460]   So great to hear.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.780]   Very curious since you've been on this journey for a bit, what has moved the needle?
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:37.820]   You're famously passionate about your coffee and so your example of splurging on the house
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:43.060]   and having a bunch of friends over, can you talk about the proportionate joy or not from
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.740]   these sort of outsize expenses, but very interested in, I'm sure a lot of Bogleheads and others
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.260]   would be curious.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:56.380]   What warrants the spending, even if, what have you experimented on and what's been worth,
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.180]   I don't want to say overspending because it's worth it if you're spending, but what has
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.140]   moved the needle?
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.940]   Quality, definitely, which quality is hard to find.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.860]   That's what I was trying to ask Ramit at some point, I was like, how do you judge quality
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.940]   versus just like brand name, social status?
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.500]   But to give you an example, like my coffee grinder, which I use every morning, it's just
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:26.540]   so beautifully made and everything about it, just sliding the drawer and pressing the button.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.940]   It's just the quality that brings me joy every morning just to use it and see it and interact
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.940]   with it.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:39.580]   So that's something that's really moved the needle, just buying things that I know I'm
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:48.460]   going to really enjoy, like obviously a computer, which I'm on all the time, and I love music,
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.660]   so I bought a good sound system for our living room so I can listen to music when we're not
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.380]   watching a movie or something.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.260]   Things like that, that I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of and enjoy out of have
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   been great.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.700]   And yeah, that's the surprising thing, I was never into stuff before, but now I'm loving
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.380]   stuff because if you have a few really nice things that you get joy out of every day,
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.380]   it's fantastic.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:15.860]   And yeah, I've been pretty good, I have experimented, there's been some duds.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:25.460]   I think the Apple Watch, I'm an Apple ecosystem kind of guy, so every time I get an Apple
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.740]   product, it makes all my other ones better.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:33.140]   So I had no need for the watch, but I was like, it should make everything else better,
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   but so far it hasn't.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.580]   It was good for skiing and keeping track of my runs and stuff, but besides that, that's
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.860]   been a sort of a dud.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:45.860]   But really, I think just being so frugal and overanalyzing every purchase all my entire
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:52.700]   life, I know pretty much what I want and what would be good and what wouldn't be.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.900]   So that's why I don't fear that getting out of control either, because it's not like I'm
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:03.440]   having an infinite set of stuff I want to buy, I have a very small set and I enjoy researching
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   to find the best one.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:12.060]   So yeah, I think quality, quality has been good, but again, it's harder to differentiate
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:18.620]   quality from just brand name appeal, I guess sometimes, but that's where I guess reviews
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.460]   come in and stuff, but yeah.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.460]   Okay.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.580]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:28.020]   Something you also mentioned you wanted to increase spending on or we're exploring is
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.620]   charitable giving.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:36.280]   And so I'm wondering, definitely want to hear more about that, but now that you've had a
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.680]   kid, does that affect your lens on charitable giving?
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.360]   Do you want to give more to your heirs or family?
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.360]   That's a very difficult one.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.880]   And that's something that I have on my to-do list to go over over the next couple of weeks.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.920]   I'm going to sort of project out all of my accounts because you sent me that book by
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.720]   Mike Piper, More Than Enough, which is fantastic and it's completely changed how I view all
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.160]   of my different accounts.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.760]   So I want to sort of see where those are all going to go.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.080]   If I keep adding money to them, if I don't, if I start taking out, if I leave them as
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.600]   is and things like that, and then that's going to affect everything because that's still
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.320]   such a difficult question because I don't know how I'm going to handle that with my
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.840]   son, which also goes back to why I'm doing what I'm doing now, buying a nice house in
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   a nice village.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.720]   It's like, yes, I could leave him a big chunk of money, but I don't want to do that.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.560]   But I don't want to not leave him a bunch of money if I have it.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:46.820]   So I'd rather spend the money to give him a better life as we grow up together than
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:52.960]   just be super frugal, have an okay life in an okay village or whatever, and then just
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.280]   leave him a big check when I die, which I don't think that's good either.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.960]   So yeah, it's tough.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:06.440]   But more than enough that you gave me so kindly a month or two back, that's really helped
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   in that sense.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.840]   So yeah, I have a bunch of notes from that book that I'm going to go over and I'm going
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.480]   to start planning that out whenever I get the chance.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:19.880]   But yeah, so for charitable giving, it's still tough for me just because I do just feel like
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.800]   I'm gripping my money with like bunch of fists.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.200]   So my goal was to give more every year.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.320]   So I've been doing that the last few years, so I just make sure I give more this year
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:37.280]   than I did last year and hopefully as I keep doing that, I'll get more comfortable with
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   it.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:45.720]   But yeah, it's been good in the sense where it's like, if anyone, any friends have a personal
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.920]   project or something important to them, like for instance, I just gave to the National
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:58.880]   Forestry Foundation, the tree email you sent me and things like that, it's like, that's
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.680]   really nice because then it's just like a no brainer.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.760]   It's like, okay, I definitely want to give more.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.840]   So anytime a friend comes with a running a marathon or anything, it's like, okay, definitely
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   no brainer.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:15.080]   So that's been nice, but yeah, it's still not natural for me.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:20.040]   But hopefully once I run through this exercise and sort of see where all these accounts are
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.440]   going, then that'll free me up a little bit more to know what I'm doing.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.640]   But yeah, currently the only goal is to give more than I did last year.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.640]   Okay.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.880]   That sounds like a great approach.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   Very systematic.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.600]   So you mentioned die with zero.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:43.880]   One of the premises of that, and I might oversimplify it, but he talks about if you die with any
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.600]   money left over, that was time wasted earning it.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.400]   And he says, of course you can give to charities and family during your life and often giving
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:59.720]   earlier than before you die is more helpful to the recipient.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.280]   You mentioned you didn't agree with all of it.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.640]   Were there any key takeaways that you remember or strongly disagreed with?
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.920]   Well, yeah, the key takeaways were definitely just like there's a season for everything.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.560]   And that's one of my only regrets with saving for FI.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.240]   I don't regret much because we did do a lot.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.960]   We traveled a lot and we did a lot of fun stuff in our twenties and thirties and I didn't
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.240]   feel like I was too big of a scrooge when it came to any sort of spending.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:31.520]   My wife may tell you differently, but yeah, one of my only regrets is like missing a few
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.480]   bachelor parties because we lived in Scotland.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.440]   So it was like, I wasn't going to fly to the States, pay to fly to the States and then
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.280]   a month later fly back for the wedding, so I would always just pick the wedding.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:48.000]   But I can't get those times back when I'm a 20-year-old idiot getting drunk with my
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.160]   idiot friends because we're older now.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.480]   And I don't think any of us would want to do that, but I missed out on a lot of those
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.080]   kind of memories just because I was like, I'm not going to fly back to the States twice
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   in a month.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.600]   So that's really my only like FI regret.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.120]   So in the book, he talks a lot about that.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:09.960]   He's like, yeah, you could save up a bunch of money like I did and then go on a vacation
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.160]   every week like we could now.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:20.760]   But you know, I'm 42 and we have a son and I don't want to go on vacation every week.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.640]   It would have been better maybe to spend that money to go on a vacation with all my best
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.680]   friends when we were 21 or something, you know what I mean?
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.280]   So it's sort of thinking about things, which has been really helpful because now that prompted
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.000]   us to do these sorts of trips and do the Airbnbs in the mountains rather than just don't ski
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   for our entire forties and then hope that we have the perfect mountain house to then
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   ski all the time.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.600]   And it's like, well, maybe I'll throw my back out when I'm 50 and then I won't want to ski
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.840]   as much and things like that.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.960]   So that's been really important.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:56.040]   The Dying With Sierra thing, I think that's more just like a good provocative title.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:04.320]   So I'm in no hurry to try to calculate how much I should spend now so that I can get
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.240]   down to zero by the time I reach 90 or whatever.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:14.480]   So yeah, that wasn't, I didn't take that away from the book, but yeah, it was really good
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:21.880]   for just refocusing my mind and being like, okay, yeah, you could buy 10 of these things
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.960]   if you save for the next 10 years, but maybe you're going to enjoy that one thing now and
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.200]   that's more, that's a better decision overall.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   And he also talks about, I forget what he calls it, but the memory dividend or something.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.880]   It's like, yeah, I could, like I said, I could save up for the next 10 years and have this
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.680]   epic winter at the best mountain resort.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:50.520]   But if I do these 10 little trips, then these little memory dividends of all those 10 trips
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:56.200]   are just like things that I can just think back on and love as much as previous memories.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   And that's value.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   There's value in that.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:03.920]   So those are some of the big takeaways, but it was really good for someone like me, naturally
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.080]   frugal, but is that a point where you don't really have to be anymore?
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   Cool.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.680]   It's always fun when we're permeable to these different ideas.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.920]   I think there's so much that just reinforces who we are already.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.440]   It's like what you said about Ramit versus Mr. Money Mustache, there's this echo chamber
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:28.480]   aspect to Mr. Money Mustache, whereas Ramit has all these challenging views that challenge
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.440]   kind of our default settings.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:36.760]   So zooming out a bit, I forget which podcast it was, but you mentioned you attended a self-improvement
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.720]   conference or something like that.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:44.200]   I'd love to hear more about that and if you remember any conceptual takeaways from it.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.800]   And then a second part of this question is so much of the self-help or self-development
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.880]   stuff gets this candy-like euphoric feeling for us.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.960]   It's just like we're basking in this candy-like information that feels really good to consume.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.440]   Was there something that affected you to act on things you may have taken away from it?
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.880]   I'm wondering if that was maybe somebody I talked to because I'm trying to think if I
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.800]   ever went to any sort of self-help things.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.960]   I know Alan Donegan, I interviewed, he was really big into Tony Robbins and stuff.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:29.160]   Me personally, I like reading books and I get that same sort of candy-like experience
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.360]   where you're like, "Wow, yeah, I can do this and change everything."
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.800]   The in-person things I've never really been into.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:44.260]   I don't know, it's just not my thing.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.640]   I just wonder how much people take away and actually do after feeling good and like, "Yeah,
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.360]   I can take on the world and walk over the hot coals," and all that sort of stuff.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.160]   It's like, "Yeah, but then you're just going to go back to your normal life."
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.680]   I get more out of just reading books and taking a few things away.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:06.720]   Like we mentioned James Clear, Atomic Habits was really, really impactful for me pursuing
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.280]   some of my personal goals.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:17.080]   That may have been Alan Donegan who I interviewed too, who had done that.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.060]   It's not really my thing, I think.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:27.400]   I think I get enough out of books to then hopefully act on some of the stuff I read
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.160]   other times, but yeah, it's hard to get past my laziness sometimes.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   Got it.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   I remember you got a lot out of reading Ultra Learning last time you recommended that.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.080]   Yeah, that was just because I needed some sort of structure to achieve or to try to
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.480]   work on a very difficult goal that I had a mental block that I just thought I could never
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.880]   do because I wanted to do it so badly.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.520]   I just thought I could never do it, but yeah, I read Ultra Learning and it allowed me to
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:01.920]   take something creative and something that you feel like you have to pluck it out of
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.920]   thin air.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:10.480]   It gave me structure and made my math brain happy, so it allowed me to apply my math brain
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.320]   to an arts and party side of my brain that I don't feel is just strong.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:22.480]   That was very helpful, but I would say Atomic Habits was more impactful and still is, to
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.040]   be honest, just getting more things done that I want to do and overriding that natural laziness.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   Amazing book.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   So practical.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.520]   So full of actionable insights.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:38.600]   I saw someone reading it on the train last night and I was just happy that it wasn't
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.000]   a flash in the pan kind of popular book for a short period of time.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.640]   So Ultra Learning, you also mentioned helped you kind of focus on your music and fulfilling
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.480]   that lifelong dream of putting out your album.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.080]   So any updates on the music front?
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.760]   Are you considering another album?
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.600]   I know you mentioned you played live.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.840]   That must have been tremendous.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.320]   Can you tell us more about that?
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.800]   Yeah, that was literally a childhood dream come true.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.440]   So the whole point of wanting to write an album was so I could play my own songs live.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.520]   And yeah, I did that, which was fantastic.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.840]   So hopefully going to do a lot more of that over the next year and yeah, I want to write
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.040]   one more album.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:24.400]   So I just the joy of having a home is that I was able to build the studio of my dreams
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   as well.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.560]   So I haven't got into it yet because we just finished it and then came to the States.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:36.920]   So yeah, that's the that is the goal for by the end of 2025.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   And then I think that'll finally be that itch scratched and in the meantime, I want to play
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:47.280]   as much live as I can and get get my brother to play with me because he's a he's a really
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.880]   he's a professional percussionist to get him on drums and that is the that's the last tick
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.200]   tick on that childhood dream of mine is to play play my own songs with my brother on
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   drums.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:04.560]   So I need to do that at some point but yeah, no, that's been a dream come true.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.280]   And yeah, it's been still my proudest accomplishment even even though like, yeah, nobody else cares,
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.720]   but I just know how hard it was to do it and all the self-doubt I had to break through
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.160]   to actually accomplish it.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.680]   So I want to prove to myself I can do it again just by doing one more one more album by the
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.040]   end of 2025.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:29.360]   But yeah, so that's that is the that is the main focus for this year besides obviously
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.660]   taking care of my son.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.480]   So yeah, it's a lot to juggle.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   Well, we'll stay tuned.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   We look forward to that.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   That duet.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.600]   I don't know if you'd call it a duet.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:43.200]   So I'll ask a question out of left field and then we don't want to keep you too long.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.000]   You have a flight tomorrow.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.100]   You've already been traveling different time zones.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:54.000]   So the out of left field question for me, my experience of the past everyone says like
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.980]   time goes so quickly, but the pace of the passage of time continually fascinates me
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.540]   like no matter how you would expect were desensitized to it, right?
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:08.260]   Like January just went by in a in a in a blink.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.300]   Is it something you think about like, I don't know, aging or or is it no big deal?
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:18.540]   Like how do you how do you make sense out of the accelerated passage, the accelerated
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.160]   pace of the passage of time?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   Yeah, just scary.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:28.420]   It's just Yeah, just turned 42 a couple days ago, and I still feel 20.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.300]   So I don't know where this couple of decades went.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:37.260]   But I was talking to my uncle, who's almost 60 now and he's like, Yeah, I still feel 22.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.660]   It's just the natural thing.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:45.120]   So I noticed the time slows down when we do more interesting things.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.460]   So that pushes me to still do interesting things.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.500]   So because now that I have a really comfortable home that I'm making amazing with my home
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:56.900]   studio and my coffee grinder and all these, you know, things that I'm kidding it out with.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.180]   There is a big draw to just stay home.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:05.020]   But I do find that as you're in that home routine, time fast passes a lot quicker.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:10.300]   So that does push me to do trips like this that I'm on and little side trips here and
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   there to, you know, it's easy to pop over to mainland Europe and make a lot of really
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.180]   good memories and just a long weekend and things like that.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.620]   So it does push me to do that because I feel like that slows time down a little bit for
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.000]   me.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.660]   But I'm also quite content, you know, watching my son grow up and be like, wow, he's so big
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:33.580]   already and yeah, we're having a lot of fun but it is going quick and he's just getting
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.100]   so big and I'm sort of okay with it.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.540]   Like I feel like, yeah, I'm getting older now.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:46.020]   So I think it comes with the territory, just the years start flipping by, which isn't great.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.460]   But yeah, I don't know if there's much you can do about it.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:53.460]   But yeah, the only thing that I've found that counteracted is to change it up and get out
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:57.980]   of the routine and make a few really interesting memories.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.980]   Excellent.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:48:59.980]   Sound advice.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.140]   Well, I can't thank you enough for coming back.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.580]   Always love speaking with you.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:11.620]   I'll just check in with Miriam really quickly if there are questions in the chat or via
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:18.260]   the RSVP function that we want to pose to Brandon.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.220]   Okay.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.180]   First question is, what is the name of your coffee grinder?
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.620]   Oh, Wilfa Uniform.
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:33.620]   So it's, I live in the UK, I believe you can get in the States, but Wilfa, W-I-L-F-A, and
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.840]   then it's Uniform.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.620]   And I got the silver one, I think the black one comes with a scale on top, which I don't
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.620]   think is very useful.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.820]   So it's just a stainless steel, just looks cool.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.740]   Well, what is so special about this coffee grinder?
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.820]   It's great.
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.860]   It feels good.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:55.180]   Everything just feels well-made and pressing the button's fun and pulling out the tray
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.780]   just feels like nice and nicely engineered.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   I don't know.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.780]   It's great.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:06.380]   It just feels good to use and the coffee grinds is delicious and what a way to start a morning.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.380]   Exactly.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.380]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.380]   And I do pour over coffee.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.380]   So it's not good for espresso.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:15.420]   I don't think it's fine enough for espresso, but I do pour over V60, like a clever dripper,
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.820]   whatever, mostly just pour over stuff.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.820]   And it's perfect for that.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.820]   You can really dial it in.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.060]   It's got consistent grind size and the burr grinder.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.800]   So it's a really good quality grind and yeah, the coffee is delicious and a great part of
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   my day.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   I love it.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Does it double as a kid's toy?
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   It will.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   It will.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   At some point it will.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:42.340]   Wait till he puts his Legos in it and grinds them up.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.340]   I have a question.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:50.140]   You were mentioning about giving away your wealth before you die.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:56.940]   And that is often talked about in the forum as one way to give to your children over time,
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:01.100]   especially when they're younger, you know, in their twenties and thirties when they could
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.460]   really use the money, you know, to buy a house or to get themselves together rather than
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.820]   waiting until you pass away in your 60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:18.620]   The man who started the Vogelheads and the Vanguard Diehards is a man named Taylor Larimore.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.820]   He is turned a hundred last week.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.980]   He's a hundred years old.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.540]   The guy doesn't even use a cane.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:31.420]   He doesn't even walk with a cane, let alone a walker and a wheelchair.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.260]   He also has done that.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:41.140]   He has said many times that he can see with his children that what do I need?
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.380]   What does he need the money for in the future?
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:50.820]   He's been giving it away to his children over time rather than, you know, wait until the,
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.280]   you know, the end.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:59.180]   On the other hand, for example, my husband and myself, we do not have long-term care
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:06.060]   insurance, meaning we do not have long-term care insurance that will help us if we have
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:14.460]   dementia or when we get old and we need lots of nursing aid help, Medicare does not pay
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.820]   for that.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:20.340]   Medicaid may pay for some, a little bit.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.060]   Who pays for it?
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.220]   We do.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:29.860]   So that is why we are saving our money more towards the end, because when we are 80 years
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:38.420]   old, 90 years old, the medical expenses can get very, very, it can be, you know, out the
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.420]   roof.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:45.780]   So that is one reason to keep, I would say to keep, you know, to keep things and being
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:50.540]   frugal like you are is good, has its good points, and you want to use your money now
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:55.860]   for your memories and for those special occasions that you will never regret using the money
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:56.860]   for.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.940]   You know, those very special occasions.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.820]   But on the other hand, you do have to think about the future and what will you do when
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:03.820]   you are older?
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:10.300]   You are not going to want the burden of your medical care on your son.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.300]   So you have to stop.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.180]   >> Yeah, no, that is a great point.
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.940]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:21.980]   Like well, currently, we are both British citizens, so we do have a bit of a bigger
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.420]   safety net than I would have had I not become a British citizen, I think.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.420]   So there is a little bit to that.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.420]   But no, I completely agree.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:35.140]   And yeah, when I said more, when I said like spending and investing and giving it away
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:41.460]   till now, it is more like, yeah, like having a nice house that then could be sold if something,
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.460]   you know what I mean?
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:48.020]   Like buying a nice house, and yeah, I still have not figured out how to go about it.
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.260]   But I think you are absolutely right.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:57.060]   There is no way I would be able to sleep if I was giving it all away, even with the safety
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:03.340]   net of having the NHS in the UK and some more free care options.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:08.140]   But yeah, I think that is a great point.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:16.060]   And also the memories, you know, many times my husband and I would not do things because
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:18.040]   of the expense.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:23.340]   We would not go to certain family vacations with the rest of the family because it was
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.260]   too expensive.
[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.380]   We did not want to take the time off from work or whatever.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.860]   Well, looking back on it, we should have gone.
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.020]   We missed a lot.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:38.620]   And then family members pass away.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.700]   You are not with them.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:47.380]   And looking back also with my kids, I have a lot of kids, the family vacations we took
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.380]   were just the high points of their life and my life.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:57.180]   And the memories, the pictures, took lots of pictures and videos of the Grand Canyon,
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:04.680]   Yellowstone, hiking in Yellowstone National Park, you know, going out on, just doing little
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:09.020]   things that really do not cost a lot of money, even with a lot of people camping.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.020]   They love it.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.020]   They love the camping.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.680]   Those, you know, don't give up that.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.140]   I would just say, you know, suggest not to give up those opportunities, even if it may
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:25.260]   cost you in particular, you know, airfare back and forth to the U.S. or to Europe.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:31.420]   It's funny you say that, because I just saw my uncle and he had mentioned he was thinking
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.900]   about doing a big family reunion at the beach in June.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.180]   And we had just got off this long nine and a half hour flight.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:42.620]   And the thought of doing that all again with the even older, more rambunctious little guy
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.660]   in just a few months, I was like, oh, man, I can't even think about it.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.860]   And then, yeah, obviously the cost as well.
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:53.580]   But then luckily I was like, yeah, let's just do it because, yeah, you're exactly right.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.860]   It's like we're not, we don't know how long we have with, you know, that extended family
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.100]   and all that sort of thing.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.260]   So I didn't say yes, but yeah, at first I was a bit overwhelmed with just the thought
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.260]   of it.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.260]   But yeah, no, that's great advice.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.260]   Jeff Bezos talks about regret minimization.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.260]   That sounds like.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.260]   What is that?
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.500]   What is regret minimization?
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.500]   So his example is he worked at a hedge fund, he was doing really well, but he had this
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:25.060]   idea because he saw the internet growth rates and he said he could start a bookstore on
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.820]   the internet.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:32.380]   And he spoke with his boss at the hedge fund who said, why do you want to leave such a
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.380]   great job?
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:40.140]   And he said, if I look back when I'm 80 and I didn't take this chance, I will regret it.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.820]   And if it fails now, he can always go back to work.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:48.740]   So he categorized that as regret minimization and he took the plunge and started Amazon
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.420]   in his garage.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:55.540]   Worked out pretty good.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:59.860]   Are you going to open it up for questions?
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.780]   Yeah, let's do that.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:06.740]   Did you say we had a few questions from the RSVP and then, Brandon, if you need to jump,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:12.380]   I know we just hit the hour mark and I can get a little respectful of your rest.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.380]   OK.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:21.180]   So the questions from the RSVP actually involve finance in the FIRE movement.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:32.540]   And one of them was, what, if any place, do alternative investments play in your portfolio?
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:39.500]   Now, he doesn't say when, whether it's before you actually retired or after you retired,
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:48.980]   but in particular, annuities, I-bonds, real estate type mutual funds, gold and silver.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:54.140]   Or are you, as I recall, you were basically the three funder once you retired.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.140]   I don't know what you were.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.420]   I don't remember what you were before you retired.
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.420]   No.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:06.120]   Just total stock market, total international stock market, a little bit of bonds, and that's
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   it.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.580]   So for me, they don't play any role.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:14.660]   I, especially at this stage, like I just buy things for life.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:21.900]   I don't ever intend to sell, especially now that I realized how amazing margin loans are
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:30.340]   for things like I have an IBKR account, Interactive Brokers, and was able to just buy my house
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.820]   against my portfolio, which was amazing.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:41.760]   So yeah, I don't really even consider selling anything in the near term anyway.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:46.400]   So when I buy something, I just want it to be happy with it for life.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.200]   So I'm happy with those.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:56.360]   Recently, it was right when they thought inflation was going to be higher for longer.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:06.300]   And I had some money to invest in, I sold a 401k and my Roth, I believe, I forget.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:16.420]   Anyway, I bought TLT, long-term treasuries, because I was like, the risk reward was pretty
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.140]   skewed at that stage.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:24.580]   So yeah, if like interest rates went up 25 basis points, you would lose, I don't know,
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:29.980]   3% or 4%, but if they went down 25 basis points, you'd make, I don't know, 7% or 8% or something,
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   something like that.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.500]   It was just an asymmetric bet.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:36.740]   So I was like, well, I need some more bonds, and then I can sell those next recession or
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.740]   whatever.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:46.900]   So I did buy some TLT, and it's done great since then, it was lucky timing, and it wasn't
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.980]   higher for longer, maybe.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.860]   So yeah, that's it.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:56.060]   So really, yeah, it's Vanguard, total stock market, total international stock market,
[00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.660]   and then total bond market, and then with a little bit of TLT thrown in, a little bit
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:06.660]   of Apple that I bought, I don't even remember when, 2014 or something.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:13.300]   It was back when they were like, Apple stock price, they have more cash on hand than the
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.780]   stock price thing the company's worth.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.060]   So I just had a little bit of money sitting around, so I put some into Apple at that stage,
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:29.660]   and then I have a little bit of Google in my Roth from, again, a while ago that I just
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.940]   thought I'd buy some Google because I was a tech guy.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:38.140]   So yeah, so that, but those are annoying because even if they're winners, then you can't sell,
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:42.100]   especially if they're in a taxable account, because you don't want to pay a bunch of tax
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.100]   on them.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:49.180]   So I got all these little, those just a few individual stocks in my portfolio, but yeah,
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.180]   simple.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:56.220]   So I don't have any of that stuff that you listed out as the alternative.
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:02.420]   And again, I would just have no conviction to hold it for 30 years if I didn't, yeah,
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.940]   I just don't feel like I would be into it, so I just don't buy it.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:06.940]   All right.
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.780]   Brandon, another question, since you live out of the United States, are you still investing
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   in Vanguard?
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:20.460]   How is it when you are not living in the U.S. and investing with Vanguard, I know we've
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:28.700]   had Bogleheads who have posted on the forum that it is difficult with the U.S. banking
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.780]   system to have investments like that.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.100]   You can have them, but you cannot trade in them or something.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.220]   Yeah, no, it's confusing, and I'm not probably the best person to talk to about it because
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:45.900]   my business is technically based in Florida, so my solo 401k can then use it and things
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.900]   like that.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:56.220]   And this is my parents' house in Florida, and so I use that as my mailing address for
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:03.660]   everything and where my business is based and where, so yeah, I'm probably not the best
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:08.500]   person to ask just because, one, I don't know if I'm doing it right.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.860]   And two, yeah, not everyone would have the same sort of setup.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:18.180]   So for me, yeah, everything's still acting as normal, and my business is still putting
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:24.760]   money into the solo 401k, and it's still getting invested whenever I invest it.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:30.220]   So yeah, I'm not sure if that would apply to everyone or not.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.220]   Right.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.220]   I understand.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.220]   Okay.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.220]   Gauri?
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.460]   That's it for me.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.740]   Brandon, again, thank you so much.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:45.580]   So before we go, we can turn it to the live audience if folks want to raise their hand.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:57.140]   Okay, it's removed.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.300]   So I'm not seeing any hands.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:06.100]   Brandon, anything you want to highlight from the blog or podcast that you want to turn
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.540]   people's attention to or?
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:15.500]   No, no, I haven't been doing much recently.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:20.380]   I hope to pick it up again once I get back to Scotland just to start going through some
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   stuff.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:28.620]   And yeah, I have lots of ideas to talk about regarding the spending stuff because yeah,
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.980]   I feel like I have made such significant progress.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:39.060]   So yeah, if you're listening to this, you can go to medfinantist.com/advice and you
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:43.300]   can enter your email address there and you'll get all the advice from my podcast guests
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.580]   where I asked them what's one piece of advice you'd give to somebody on the path to financial
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.580]   independence.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.460]   So I put that onto a PDF.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:54.300]   But anyway, the point is you get on the email list, which there's like 100,000 people on
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.300]   there.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:01.020]   I don't know anybody and I've barely even messaged people to be honest, because I don't
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.020]   do that much content.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:06.420]   But if you're on that list, then you'll get those posts when I eventually do them, which
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.620]   I'm hoping once I get back to Scotland, I can actually sit down and start writing out
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.620]   some of the stuff.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:16.220]   Because like I said, I do feel like I've made a lot of good progress and all the changes
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.140]   I've made with my spending have been positive.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.980]   So I think it is something worth looking into for naturally frugal people like me.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:30.220]   So yeah, you could just go to medfinantist.com/advice and just get on the email list there.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.220]   Sounds good.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.860]   Lady Geek has her hand up.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860]   Just want to...
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:39.060]   I know Brandon, you're running out of gas there, but there were two questions from the
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.100]   chat was for you.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:45.380]   There were also a couple other questions, but myself and several members were answering
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.620]   the chat on our own.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:47.620]   Oh, nice.
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:48.620]   So sorry.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:54.900]   At a high level, what withdrawal rate have you been able to maintain and do you have
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.220]   income coming in?
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.220]   So yeah.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.220]   So income coming in.
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.980]   So withdrawal rate zero since I left.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.940]   So that's the ironic part.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.380]   I've worked so hard to save all this up.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.900]   And then the application, like some of the software that I wrote prior to leaving my
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.820]   job then took off.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.300]   And so I haven't had to withdraw, which is why I'm sort of focusing more on the spending
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:23.860]   side now, because I realized that all of my projections and all the math that I did prior
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:29.680]   to FI is sort of out the window if I'm not withdrawing from the portfolio.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.580]   So it made me rethink of what I'm going to be doing with all those things.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.900]   So income could go to zero tomorrow, which I'm obviously prepared for, because I haven't
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.180]   exceeded...
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.740]   Our spending hasn't ever exceeded what the portfolio could generate at a safe withdrawal
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.100]   rate.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.100]   But it just hasn't.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.420]   I haven't had to tap into it yet.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   So I usually start anything I'm talking about with that caveat, because it does change how
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.860]   I view spending and withdrawal and investments.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:06.460]   And I'm willing to take a little bit more, I guess, more risk in my investments because
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.660]   I do have that income as a backup.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:15.300]   Okay, one easy question, will you continue with your podcast?
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.540]   Yes, but probably not in the same format.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:23.660]   I took, I don't even know if anyone noticed last year, because I only usually release
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.340]   maybe, I don't know, a handful of episodes a year anyway.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.180]   And last year, I didn't do any new interviews.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.940]   I had a couple of podcast takeovers and I had a couple other things that I did a few
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:39.780]   best of episodes and things, but I decided to take a whole year off of interviews.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.020]   And that's mainly because I feel like I've talked to everyone I wanted to talk to, and
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.340]   I've learned everything I wanted to learn.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.100]   And that's why Remit was my last interview, because I feel like that was a whole thing,
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.660]   that was a whole aspect that I haven't really even thought about, but I really needed to
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.380]   address was that like spending and learning how to spend.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:07:01.500]   So I was really excited to talk to him, but then I don't want to just interview the same
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.220]   people and talk about the same things.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.940]   I feel like I've covered a lot of the things that I wanted to cover.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:12.220]   The one I may change the format of it, so it will continue in some aspect, but I don't
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:16.460]   think it'll be me interviewing people about how they achieve financial independence.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:22.100]   I think maybe it'll be talking more with people after they've achieved five to find out the
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:26.060]   interesting things they're doing with their freedom and their money, is that to me right
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.420]   now is more interesting.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:34.140]   I think the mechanics of five have been covered by me and many others at Ozium at this stage,
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:41.740]   so it just doesn't interest me to get another person on to talk about the same things I've
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   covered.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.580]   But the stuff afterwards where you're like actually utilizing it to live in a cool, interesting
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:51.380]   life or do interesting things, that does appeal to me, so I think I'm going to try to figure
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:52.380]   out a way to do that.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.300]   Okay, one more question and a comment, and I think you're out of gas.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:03.020]   Can you talk more about your income from software and is it passive?
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.020]   Your software income?
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.020]   Yeah, it is.
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:06.020]   Yes.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:14.340]   So the main source of the software income is an application I wrote actually probably
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:20.380]   maybe two years before even the Mad Fientes started, so maybe 2010.
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:29.380]   It's a credit card search tool for people who are really interested in travel rewards.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:36.740]   So back in the day, I was like it's very confusing in the States where Chase points transfer
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:43.500]   to Delta at this ratio, but then Amex points transfer to Delta at this other ratio.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.260]   But then you have also Delta cards, and I was like I just want to get the card that's
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.300]   going to give me the most Delta points, and I don't care if it's a Chase Ultimate Rewards
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:54.300]   card, I don't care if it's an Amex Membership Rewards card.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:09:00.580]   So anyway, so I built this search tool that stores all of those transfer ratios and stores
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:04.980]   all the cards so that you can go in and be like okay, I want a no annual fee card, I
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.980]   want to earn Delta miles, and I want no foreign transaction fees, and you can click all these
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:13.700]   buttons and then it will give you the best cards in reverse order of like the biggest
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.700]   sign-up bonuses.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:23.100]   So I wrote that prior to even starting The Mad Bientist, but now it is a nearly passive
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.780]   application.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:29.500]   I work with an intermediary company, so I don't work directly with the banks, I work
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:33.380]   with a company that works with the banks, so I don't even have to maintain the relationships
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.940]   with the banks, and they have a database with all the cards, and I have an API.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.740]   I just access their API, my application just accesses their API, so it sucks in all the
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:49.300]   updated card data automatically, and every so often I'll need to change something manually
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:55.420]   or I'll need to add a new card or something like that, but it's less than, yeah, it's
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:02.460]   less than 40 hours in a year, not even, like I can, yeah, I would say here and there, like
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.940]   maybe responding to an email.
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:09.300]   So it is relatively passive, but I hate the word, I hate the term passive income because
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:14.580]   it's not, it's front-loaded work, front-loaded work with no guarantee of any sort of payoff,
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:18.940]   and that's what it was, because for years it just sat there languishing because it was
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.820]   like a chicken and egg problem, you can't get a relationship with the credit card companies
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:28.020]   until you're generating lots of conversions, but you can't generate a lot of conversions
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.020]   without getting paid for them because how are you going to, you're just going to spend
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:37.220]   a bunch of money to generate conversions that don't pay you, so it was just like a chicken
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:43.380]   and egg problem, so it sat there for probably, I don't know, six to eight years doing nothing,
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:50.220]   and then it just started taking off, yeah, probably six, seven years ago.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:51.220]   Okay, thanks.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:56.580]   Okay, just one comment that what you mentioned earlier on, it resonated with me because I
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:03.340]   do that as well, that is spend money on quality products, not, I gave an example of food,
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.980]   like things with high fructose corn syrup and whatever else they put in that stuff,
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:12.300]   I ignore because I can afford to buy the real stuff, and it makes a huge difference in my
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   lifestyle, eating good food, but also by quality, like you do computers, I build computers,
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:24.380]   and I buy the stuff that I want, I say it's not a want, it's not a need, it's a want,
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:30.980]   and I want good stuff, also buy like good tools, don't ever buy cheap tools, really,
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:36.500]   like client tools, you know, that kind of stuff, not the knockoffs that you see overseas,
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.860]   so I just say that resonated with me, because people say when you have enough, they talk
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:46.380]   about going on cruises and trips, those are like thousands of dollars, guys, wake up,
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:51.300]   if you spend another five or 10 bucks in the supermarket, your quality of life goes up
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.620]   just as well, if even more, so spend another five or 10 bucks instead of thousands, and
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:01.100]   it'll make a huge difference, so I couldn't agree more, and that brings up a great point,
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:06.180]   so something Ramit said to me during our conversation, which I never got into, only probably over
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:11.080]   the last three weeks, he said, why spend less when you could spend more, and I was like,
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.500]   that makes no sense, that doesn't compute with my frugal, natural, frugal brain, it
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:22.660]   makes no sense, but it was only recently with food that it made sense, and I always just
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:27.460]   bought the cheapest rice, 'cause I was like, it's rice, who cares, what's the difference,
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:33.060]   it doesn't make any difference, it's just rice, but then I was like, all right, why
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:37.380]   spend less when I could spend more, I'm gonna buy the fanciest rice, and man, it's so good,
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:44.620]   it's so much better, and then I found a big bulk bag of 10 kilogram bulk bag on Amazon,
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:49.020]   so it's actually not even that much more expensive when you buy it like that, but it's the first
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:53.860]   time I understood why spend less when you can spend more, so now with food, it's always,
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:13:00.580]   I'm trying the most expensive thing, and then I'll work my way down to see where the benefit
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:05.940]   actually cuts off, but that was the first time that made sense, and that's when I interviewed
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:15.220]   him October of 2022, maybe, so that's the first time it's actually sunk in, it made
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.420]   sense that phrase, 'cause up until then, it didn't compute.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:24.180]   - Came to fruition, who would have imagined that rice would be a gateway drug?
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.180]   - Yeah.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.180]   - Yeah.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.180]   - So good, though.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.580]   - It's not just ingredients, also, what you do is I go to the top level name brand, but
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:40.100]   look at the quality, the grains, the size, the color, and even look at the olive oil,
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:46.420]   I'm a maniac with olive oil, yeah, I could talk all day about olive oil.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:51.620]   - Yeah, okay, so we're resonating here, I'm an engineer, yeah, I'm resonating here, but
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.620]   yeah, that's--
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:57.100]   - She's an engineer, she counts the grains of rice and she puts them in different piles.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.740]   - But yeah, I don't look at the price, I look at uniprice, and then I look at how much served,
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.260]   all right, so I'm going off, I'm done.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:15.540]   - Rice per grain of rice, actually, I have another expression that is buying cheap costs
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:23.380]   more or going cheap costs more in the long run.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.380]   - Especially for tools and things like that, yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.920]   - Yeah, well, for me, for example, I'm a homeowner in Florida, and we have lots of beautiful
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:37.020]   tropical trees, well, they grow all year round and they need pruning.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:47.540]   So pruning my homestead here, such as it is, is about $4,000, $4,500 every time I prune
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:55.060]   the trees, and that is a lot of money for trees, but you have to do it, you cannot put
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:15:00.180]   it aside, because if you do it, then the next time you prune, it's gonna be 5,000 or 6,000,
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:05.060]   and also the county and the local government will be after you to prune those trees, and
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.380]   now the insurance companies drive around and say, well, we're gonna cut your insurance
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:12.020]   off if you don't prune those trees, they're on your roof.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.420]   So you have to do it, it's part of homeownership.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:22.820]   So I went with a less expensive tree company, a certified arborist, but a less expensive
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.580]   company than I usually use.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:33.180]   So this time it was $4,000, in the end I spent 5,000, the men were great, however, he had
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:39.340]   them booked for one day only, so they were here for 11 hours, by the time they were done,
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:44.620]   they were so exhausted, they were making mistakes, cutting off limbs they should not have, cutting
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:50.900]   them in the wrong spot, and in addition, I felt so, they work so hard, I gave them double
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:56.580]   the tip I normally do, and then their equipment, because it had been raining earlier, sunk
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   into the soil, so then when they left I had large holes, which will stay there forever
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:09.220]   unless I have them filled with sod put over it, by the time it was done I paid well over
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.220]   $5,000.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:16.880]   Yeah, I used to cheap out on things that were important to me, like musical instruments
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:22.900]   and stuff, like synthesizers, I love synthesizers, and I'd buy the cheapest version, but then
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.260]   I realized you buy the nicest version, because one, you're going to get so much joy using
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.960]   a really nicely engineered piece of equipment, but then you could sell it, it'll hold its
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.140]   value more, so you could sell it later and it's actually not as expensive as the cheaper
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:40.340]   version because you could maybe even make money from it, let alone spend money on it,
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:44.620]   whereas the cheap version it's just going to be thrown in the landfill in two years.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:51.400]   But what you said is you get the joy of using it, it's like the joy of having something,
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.840]   you know, just a nice thing that you can, a nice coffee mug even, you know, that just
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:02.880]   feels nice, or a nice piece of clothing, a nice, you know, a dress or a jacket that you
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.720]   wear that just feels nice on and the material is so nice, it's the joy of owning it as part
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:14.760]   of, you know, spending money on something pleasurable in life.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.680]   Excellent.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:30.760]   On that note, Brandon, thanks again.
