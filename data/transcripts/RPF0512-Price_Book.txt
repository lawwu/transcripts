[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.920]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about how to decrease your expenses, how to
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.920]   build and use a price book to save you money in the short term and the long term, and perhaps
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.560]   most importantly, to train your frugal muscles for a lifetime of getting more for less.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:12.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.880]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.480]   My name is Joshua and I am your host and today we're going to be very, very practical, continuing
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.160]   our quest of helping you to save money by talking about price books.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.080]   I'm going to explain to you what a price book is, talk about the benefits of having one,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.520]   how to build one and share with you some of the surprising results of my own work in this
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   area.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   I've stated recently several times that one of my goals for 2018 is to cut our grocery
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.320]   budget, our family grocery budget substantially.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.720]   My personal target is to see if I can trim out about 2,000 bucks this year off of the
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.320]   money that we spend in groceries.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.720]   A little hard to track sometimes because of course we have a pantry and I don't have it
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.500]   exactly perfectly figured out.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.480]   But that's kind of the mental goal in my head.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   I'm going to trim a couple thousand bucks out of our grocery budget and knock this thing
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   out of the park.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   In order to do so, I have to go back to the fundamentals.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.160]   I have to go back to the basics and pick up some of those things that I have let go.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.040]   I think frankly this is something that we find in many areas of our life.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.960]   When we get out of shape, we have to go back to the fundamentals.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.040]   When we start getting fat, let's say that you are fat and then you got skinny and then
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.720]   you get fat again, well, you got to go back to the fundamentals.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.400]   The same thing with saving money.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.080]   I've frequently found that I have to go back to the fundamentals.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.000]   One of those fundamentals for helping you to do a better job with your spending is the
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.520]   use of a price book.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.760]   I'm going to be using the example of a price book today in the context of groceries because
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.560]   all of us buy groceries in some form or another.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.200]   That's probably the most practical way for us to use this information.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.600]   But of course you can and should use this in other areas.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.980]   So what is a price book?
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.900]   In essence, a price book is your own personal record of what things cost in different places
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.280]   at different times.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.120]   That's the philosophical sounding dictionary definition.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.960]   But basically it's a notebook in which you write down what the stuff that you regularly
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.680]   buy or want to buy costs you at different times and in different places.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.840]   So it would be as simple as having a notebook and if you're going to shop for green beans,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.700]   you write down how much green beans cost at the different stores that you go to.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.600]   You write down if there's a sale on green beans and if there's not a sale and you calculate
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.280]   how much green beans cost per pound and that helps you to figure out where to buy your
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.560]   green beans.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.380]   Because some stores will regularly have green beans priced more cheaply than other stores.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.760]   It will also help to guide you on when to buy your green beans.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.880]   You may find that at the end of the harvest season where you live, there are dramatic
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.160]   sales on green beans and you can buy boxes and boxes of them at a 50 or 70% discount.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.860]   If you can figure out how to either use them or to store them, that may be a really good
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.800]   way for you to get the valuable nutrition and food content of the green beans at a cheaper
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   price.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.040]   Of course, there are some other products that you may buy regularly that you can use sales
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.960]   and coupons to know when to stock up.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.440]   Maybe you buy coffee in a big can, a number 10 can at your local store or maybe you buy
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.520]   jars of peanut butter and they're having a sale at the store and you need to know, "Oh,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.400]   should I buy a dozen jars of peanut butter or should I just buy one or two?"
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.280]   And if you'll start to do this over time, it'll allow you to always pay the lowest possible
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.920]   cost for the items that you want to use, but you have to have the data.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.840]   A price book is so valuable because it helps you to know which stores give you those best
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.380]   prices and when to stock up.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.800]   One of the trends that you should observe in your own life and in others' lives is
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.480]   as you go from poverty to wealth and as you continue in that journey, you should take
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.680]   advantage of your wealth in order to buy larger amounts of product that you're going to
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.760]   use at lower prices.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.160]   If you study the poor people all around the world, you'll find that one of the things
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.960]   they do is frequently buy very small quantities of things because their cash flow is very
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   limited.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.320]   They can't afford to trot down to Costco and buy a giant box of 50 or 100 rolls of toilet
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   paper.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.200]   They go down to the local store and they buy one little roll of toilet paper because they
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.520]   don't have $20 to spend on toilet paper.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.720]   They have 30 cents to spend on toilet paper or 50 cents.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.080]   By the way, Costco toilet paper costs 50 cents a roll – sorry, 53 cents a roll and that's
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.400]   one of the benefits of having a price book is to know that every time you put a roll
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.760]   of toilet paper on, how much that actually costs depending on where you are purchasing
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   it.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.800]   So when you don't have a lot of money, you have to buy things in small quantities.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.200]   But when you buy things in small quantities, you usually pay the highest possible price
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.160]   per unit, the highest possible price per roll of toilet paper because – and this isn't
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.840]   so common in the United States.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.960]   Although it does exist, but in many parts of the world, if you go into a barrio or a
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.280]   neighborhood, a ghetto of some kind where there are many, many poor people congregated
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.240]   together, you'll find that they do their shopping in the local corner store.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.720]   Whatever they're called in your neck of the woods, whether it's a pouperie or a
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   sorry-sorry store or a rabe du coin or a dollar general or whatever the local iteration of
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.360]   it is, you have a shopkeeper who takes and buys large packages and splits them up.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.920]   Very convenient and helpful for poor people but pricey when considered on the unit prices.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.360]   So as your wealth grows, you should look at the things that you buy and you should be
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.480]   willing to purchase larger quantities of them as long as you're going to use them if you
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.080]   can get a better price.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   But the price book is what tells you when you should stock up.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.920]   Either when in the season – one of the strategies everybody can implement is just do your shopping
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.520]   off-season.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.920]   Purchase your lawnmower if you need a lawnmower in the fall.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.600]   Purchase your snowblower in the spring.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.640]   Purchase your winter clothing in the spring when it's being rebated and discounted.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.680]   One of the best times to go shopping for your Christmas presents for next year is right
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.960]   after Christmas this year.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.240]   The next best time to buy your candy for next year is right after Valentine's Day or right
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.020]   after Halloween this year.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:48.840]   Look for the – to be out of time and look for when the best time to buy certain things
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.020]   is that you can stock up.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.380]   As long as you're dealing with products that aren't going to go bad, that's going
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.180]   to be helpful to you.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.820]   And also stock up anytime you find a good buy, whether that's a good buy that you
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.720]   can manufacture, create, buy a discount that you find or coupons that you can apply, rebates
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.300]   that you've discovered or a good buy just simply in terms of a good sale and the price
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.100]   book tells you how to do that.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.880]   Now with regard to food, I think this is the best place for us all to start because most
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.220]   of us have a dizzying number of options available for where we can actually purchase our food
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.580]   and what kind of food we can buy.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.580]   I live in a food oasis.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.660]   I talk about food deserts which is the idea of living in a place where there aren't
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.420]   a lot of great options available for you to buy good food.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.780]   I live in a food oasis.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:42.620]   It's almost embarrassing within a very reasonable – within ten minutes of my house in the
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.580]   car, much of it within five minutes.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.060]   I've got bunches of grocery stores.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.060]   There are Publix.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.060]   There's a Winn-Dixie.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.100]   These are regional southern grocery stores like Kroger.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.900]   There's Aldi nearby.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.140]   Then there are tons of elite stores where I live.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.860]   We've got Whole Foods, Fresh Market, Trader Joe's.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.660]   I've got health food stores, independent nutrition supermarkets and health food stores
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.420]   where you can purchase all of the crunchy stuff.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.500]   I've got a great ethnic market, big ethnic – a couple of big ethnic supermarkets that
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.220]   live where I live, one that's targeted towards Latinos.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.220]   Everything is in Spanish.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:24.260]   All of the food is from Central and South America, all the Central and South American
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.260]   brands.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.540]   One that's targeted towards – it has a lot of Hispanic food but a lot of Arab food,
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.900]   a lot of Indian food, a lot of food from the islands.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.620]   Obviously, if you need to buy live crabs or jellyfish tentacles or if you want to get
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.540]   a frozen goat head for your dinner tonight or purchase a package of cow's feet, that's
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.540]   the store you go to.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.180]   I love taking my children there because we're usually the only white people in the store.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.500]   They love to look at all of the little animals and things that you can buy.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.540]   I've got fruit and vegetable stands.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540]   We've got Walmart.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   I've got the big box stores, Costco and Sam's Club and BJ's and various green
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.540]   markets.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.620]   The one place where we lack, what we don't have is we don't have access to a lot of
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.740]   local producers or a lot of local farms.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.100]   Where we live, the green markets are kind of hoity-toity posh affairs rather than places
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.500]   where you can actually go to get a deal.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.860]   You pay through the teeth when you go to the green market because usually you're buying
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.820]   the fanciest, most artisan food.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.100]   That's not a great place to save money.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.620]   That's a good place to go for the experience.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.380]   We live in so many of these.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:40.500]   I have an abundance of riches where I live in that regard, but it's hard to know what
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   to buy where.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.140]   It's hard to do this in your head.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.860]   Let me walk you through the process of creating your own price book and then I'll tell you
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.500]   some of the examples of the results of me going back to this.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.580]   My wife and I first married.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.940]   I used to have a price book at that time, but our food shopping was so simple that we
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.460]   just kind of gave it up and quit.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.240]   But now, I'll go back to that fundamental.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.400]   What you do in my recommendation way is start on paper.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.660]   What I prefer is a three-ring binder.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.980]   The reason I prefer a three-ring binder is it makes it easy to change the order of the
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.420]   pages.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.580]   I used a simple notebook paper.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.780]   You're going to designate a page to each type of food that you buy.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.300]   What I would do is if I'm trying to figure out where to buy green beans, I'll just write
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.900]   at the top of the page a very natural category listing.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.820]   For me, it would be beans, green.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.420]   I'll alphabetize the pages based upon the product.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.780]   I know that my beans are going to be on one page.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.860]   I'll have beans, green.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.300]   Of course, on that green bean, I won't put it out into string beans or all the different
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.300]   varieties.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.660]   I'll just put basically things that are kind of like green beans.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.500]   Then I would have a page for dried beans, things like that.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.020]   I would have a page for peanut butter and a page for eggs.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.140]   The value of this three-ring binder is that you can infinitely sort and shuffle your pages
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.380]   and keep them alphabetized so it's quick and easy to find.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.120]   You can do this with a notebook, but it's harder because in a notebook, you're not going
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.620]   to know the exact categories as you create it.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.180]   It's a little bit harder to create an ad hoc category.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:22.780]   Recently, I was looking and thinking about getting an extra battery jump pack for my
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.780]   vehicle.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.460]   So I just created ad hoc a page for a battery jump pack in my vehicle.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.060]   There was a rebate on one at Costco – excuse me, it was on sale at Costco.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.060]   I wrote it down and then I came home and started researching other ones to see where the best
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.660]   price would be on that type of item.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.580]   That's the benefit of a three-ring binder.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:47.100]   The disadvantage of a three-ring binder, which you should be very aware of, is that it's
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.540]   a bit more unwieldy than a small notebook.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.500]   A three-ring binder, in order to use it, has to be opened up.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.780]   Now, if you shop by yourself, this is relatively simple just to perch it on the cart and to
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.780]   use it.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.660]   But if you shop as I do with a bundle of young children, it's a little bit harder sometimes
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.620]   to keep that three-ring binder out and open where you need it.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.540]   So you might need to either shop by yourself or use a notebook.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.100]   But just have a simple three-ring binder.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.940]   And in that binder, write down the items of what you buy and start to track the place
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.960]   that you buy it and start to track what's going on with the sales.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:28.300]   What I do is I write down the date that I am looking at so that I know what's going
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.740]   on at a certain time and I can track the dates.
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.720]   Then I write down the store that I'm shopping at.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.700]   You can just jot the name or come up with your own little abbreviation code for knowing
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.180]   which store you're in.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.940]   Write the item and write the package size.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:51.100]   So if it's an 18-ounce item and it's $5 or $1, then go ahead and just write that
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   down so you're clear on what that is.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.740]   Then I make a note if there's a rebate or something on it right at the moment.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.300]   I make a note of the standard price and the rebate amount.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   And then calculate the unit cost.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:08.660]   The way you calculate the unit cost is you take the price of the item and divide it by
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.580]   the number of units that you want to calculate.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.700]   Sometimes that'll be per pound if you're dealing with something that is easily measured
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.660]   per pound.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.700]   Sometimes it'll be per ounce if you're dealing with something that's most easily
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.580]   measured in per ounce.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.620]   Sometimes it might be measured in the actual number of units.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.580]   So each – for example, I was recently pricing out bagels.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.100]   And so I didn't use the ounce.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:43.300]   I used the each and I calculated how much each bagel costs and – or some other thing
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   that's appropriate.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.860]   So just divide the price by the number so that you can get a unit price.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.500]   And that unit price is important so that you can compare items across different quantities.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.200]   I know just a moment I'll – well, here would be an example of a comparison of one
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.700]   of my categories would be raisins.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.760]   We enjoy eating raisins and of course, most people do.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.760]   Raisins are not inexpensive.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.740]   I find – in my opinion, they're pretty expensive.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.740]   But I have different supplies that I go to with raisins and different types of raisins.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:20.260]   And I'd prefer to buy larger packages of things if that gets me a discount.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.060]   So just two prices for you as of current prices.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.180]   At Costco, they don't sell non-organic raisins anymore.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.500]   They only sell organic raisins.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.220]   And one of the things that you want to do in your price book is always note the exact
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.900]   type of thing that you're talking about.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.460]   Now, I don't think this should be separated by page.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.700]   For example, if my page is dedicated to raisins, I'm not going to have a page for organic
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.940]   raisins and for conventional raisins.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.060]   I'm just going to write down raisins.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.440]   But write down the cost of organic and conventional on that page so you can choose to make whatever
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.820]   quality choice you think is appropriate.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.860]   But you can be aware of the prices.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.460]   So at Costco, they sell organic raisins for $2.72 per pound.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:04.820]   They come in packages of two 23-ounce bags for $2.72 per pound.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:11.020]   If I go to my local restaurant supply store where I do a good amount of shopping, I can
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.580]   buy a 30-pound box of conventional raisins for $1.43 a pound.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.900]   So almost a – about probably what?
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.760]   40 to 45 percent savings there from $2.72 to $1.43 per pound.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.900]   But the difference is I'm going to go from two bags of raisins, which Costco in this
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:34.100]   case is actually what I consider a small amount, to a 30-pound box of raisins, which is going
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.380]   to require much different handling in terms of how you're actually going to deal with
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.820]   a 30-pound box.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.580]   But you only can get that price comparison if you'll split it out into a per pound cost.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.260]   So make it intelligent and make the per pound cost or the per ounce cost a number that's
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.260]   useful for you.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.580]   Now, as part of your kit, what I recommend is just attach a calculator, a permanently
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.620]   attached calculator to your binder or to your notebook or make that the standard thing that
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.620]   you keep in your pocket.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:07.220]   Of course, you could do the calculation on your phone or you can use the calculator on
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.540]   your phone or you can use a separate one.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.820]   But I think it's a lot easier just to have a separate small calculator there.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:18.380]   And I find it useful to shop with a calculator, period, just so that the amount of food that
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.300]   I buy doesn't exceed the budget.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.940]   It's much easier to do that with a calculator.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.180]   As you put an item in your cart, you just quickly add the total to it.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.500]   Now, for those of you who are nerds, this is where reverse Polish notation – I actually
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.540]   really love it.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.180]   It's much better to use a calculator.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.980]   I always just use one of my financial planning calculators.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.280]   But it's much easier to do – I think it's more intuitive to do this when you have reverse
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.340]   Polish notation on your calculator system when you're in the grocery store.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:57.720]   So there's a hardcore nerd detail for you on the most convenient type of calculator.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.540]   If you don't want to deal with a three-ring binder, all is not lost.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.620]   There are a couple of ways that you can do this or you can do these strategies in addition
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.360]   to your three-ring binder.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.780]   One of the beautiful things about living in 2018 is that the cost of taking pictures has
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.900]   fallen to in essence zero where you can take pictures with your phone.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.220]   And so as you're in the store, whether you're buying something or not buying something,
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:26.620]   just use your phone and snap some pictures of the item and the price.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.500]   Make sure that in the photo, you're able to get the actual item so that you can see
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.820]   the quantity, the size of the item or the number that's in it and the price.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.540]   Then when you get home, you can go ahead and enter the data there.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:44.140]   I frequently find that especially if I'm shopping with my children as I frequently
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.100]   do, I frequently find that it's easier for me just to go ahead and snap pictures with
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.980]   my phone and then update my price book when I get home.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.580]   It's easy enough to sit at my desk and flip through the pictures and write down the exact
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.420]   numbers and a little easier than balancing a book or a notebook in on a cart.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.500]   So feel free to try that out.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.780]   In the long run, I think keeping the data in a spreadsheet is perfectly fine, especially
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.620]   if you're a spreadsheet nerd, but it's unnecessary.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:17.380]   And in the short term, I think it's better to do in a physical binder or a physical notebook
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.420]   because you don't need that much data to actually start to inform your decisions.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.940]   You just need a little bit of data.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.740]   And once you have the information on which stores have what prices, then the only time
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.700]   you're going to be adding more transactions is when you run across what might be a good
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.700]   deal.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.940]   So you run across something that's on sale or discounted, rebated, et cetera.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.620]   You have a bunch of coupons.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.140]   When you run that across, that's when you go and look in your price book and see, is
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.820]   this a good deal?
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.420]   So there are in essence two phases to using a price book.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.660]   There's the initial construction and during the initial construction, you'll start to
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.740]   make certain decisions about your usage pattern.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.740]   Let me give you another example from my own.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.780]   I was recently looking at dishwasher detergent.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:05.500]   Now, what I've usually done is purchased dishwasher detergent at Costco.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.920]   And so Costco sells a present, a Cascade Advanced Power Gel and it's 7.5 cents an ounce for
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.420]   dishwasher detergent.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.340]   But in constructing my price book, I was looking at Walmart.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.500]   Walmart sells Cascade Complete for 8 cents an ounce.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.820]   I don't know what the difference is between Cascade Advanced Power Gel and Cascade Complete.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.620]   But in my mind, they're probably the same thing.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.540]   It's hard for me to imagine there's that much additional technology in Advanced Power Gel
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.540]   versus Complete.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.860]   I think that's just a marketing name.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.940]   But I was interested to see that Walmart, right next to the bottles of Cascade Complete,
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:46.160]   sells a bottle of Great Value brand dishwasher detergent.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.600]   Same size bottle, same green bottle as the Cascade Complete.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.700]   My guess would be it's made by Cascade and it's exactly the same stuff.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.240]   But the Great Value brand is 4 cents an ounce instead of 8 cents an ounce.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.980]   That informs my decision because now I need to get a bottle of the Great Value brand,
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:09.620]   test it for efficacy, and see can I get the same results from my dishwasher with the same
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:16.260]   amount as the Cascade Complete for half the cost by choosing the Great Value brand.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.640]   If so, then that would become my standard item to be purchased.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.940]   So if I'm writing these things down in my price book and I'm creating it for the first
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.380]   time, I'm going to create a page.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.260]   It's called "Dishwasher Detergent."
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.940]   I'm going to look around at my options.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.220]   I'm going to look for – at Costco.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.220]   I'm going to look at Walmart.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.460]   I'm going to look at the grocery store.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.420]   I'm going to look at some different brands and try to figure out what brands are available
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.500]   and what's their cost per ounce or if necessary, you would do cost per load.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.580]   Something like laundry detergent, you would need to try to figure out cost per load.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.580]   But skip laundry detergent.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.340]   It's way too complicated to try to figure out an answer there because there's no uniform
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:57.780]   standard mechanism for comparing how much laundry detergent you would use to get your
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.180]   clothes a certain level of clean.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.820]   Stick with something simple while you're learning these skills.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:09.100]   Once I've decided that if by way of example, Great Value brand is the standard, then that
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.420]   becomes the knowledge.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.580]   I buy Great Value brand.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.260]   It's four cents per ounce.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.500]   If while you're out shopping, you stumble across something, you just quickly compare
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.500]   it back to that.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.060]   It's not cheaper.You don't need to continue collecting more data and continue writing
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.280]   things down.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.700]   You would only make additional entries if you had to make a different brand choice or
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.860]   if something became cheaper and you find out that, wait a second, every three months, Costco
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:39.280]   puts their Cascade on sale and there's such a good rebate that it makes sense to go ahead
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.780]   and purchase it from there.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:46.220]   You would only add new information as you have new data that would become cheaper.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.180]   So there's no problem with keeping this physically, especially in the beginning.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.140]   And then in time, you could choose whether you wanted to keep it physically or digitally.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.660]   I have looked for application solutions in time past.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.020]   I looked for digital apps and there are a few apps that advertise themselves as being
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.580]   useful for a price book.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.320]   I did not find them to be functional for me.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.780]   But if you're an app user, you can do that.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.340]   One of the benefits if you did choose a solution that were digital, especially if it were digital
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:20.660]   and it were accessible from your mobile device, you would find that that's always with you.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.420]   And you want to make sure that your price book is with you when you're out shopping.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.720]   Very few of us would forget our phone.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.860]   Many of us would easily forget our physical price book at home.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.820]   So consider an app.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.840]   What I think is probably the best long-term solution is use a paper one for a while.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.700]   And then as you're standardized, go ahead and just set up a simple spreadsheet.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.860]   And I anticipate in the future, once I work out the kinks over the coming months, I'll
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.540]   go ahead and just digitize my price book, set it into a spreadsheet.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.980]   And my ideal spreadsheet design in this case is just to keep a very simple, probably one
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.180]   sheet, spreadsheet, and to use it in a digitized solution.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.300]   Of course, Google Docs would work easily and well here.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:08.780]   But if you wanted a non-Google solution, something like Zoho should work well or perhaps Excel
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:16.980]   if synchronized through the Office 365 solution, some kind of digital solution that allows
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.020]   you to maintain your spreadsheet so it's right there on your phone.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.740]   That probably is the best solution long-term.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.740]   So you don't always have an unwieldy book.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.200]   But there's nothing wrong with a physical, physical book.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.340]   One final suggestion for you is as you're tracking these unit prices, consider going
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.420]   ahead and just adding the information to your financial software, especially as you are
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.740]   learning and developing the skills.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:46.220]   Figure out how much a roll of toilet paper costs you so that you're aware of it, not
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.700]   just the unit price but figure out, okay, that's how much it costs or figure out how
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.340]   much a – running the dishwasher costs per load.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.580]   Figure out how much a jar of peanut butter costs and figure out how long that takes you.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:06.180]   And that can be just well-tracked in the memo portion of your financial tracking software
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.860]   if that's what you use.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.620]   But to start with, keep it simple.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:15.140]   Let me give you a few examples of just some surprising – to me, surprising results that
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:21.700]   I've learned from my recent reintegration of my price book into my budget.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.900]   This will show you how this can affect your purchasing habits.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.180]   And then I'll close the show with some tips on how to kind of turbocharge your results
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:37.220]   to help you save money and a quick discussion of if it's actually important and worth it.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.820]   By comparing prices, you'll find surprises.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:47.260]   I recently was looking for asparagus and I was interested to see that asparagus sells
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:53.800]   for $5.99 per pound at one of the local grocery stores, $5.99 per pound.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:00.260]   But at Costco, they're presently offering asparagus for $3.52 per pound in a frozen
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.380]   steamable bag, $3.52.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.940]   So let's just call it $3.50 versus $6 a pound.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.740]   That's probably about a 45% savings by purchasing it frozen.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.300]   Similarly, when pricing green beans, I found that I could buy in my local grocery store,
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:22.020]   I could buy green beans, fresh, conventional green beans in bulk for $1.69 per pound.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:27.740]   But for $1.34 per pound, I could purchase organic frozen bags of green beans at my local
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.100]   Costco.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:36.180]   That's instructive because my understanding is frozen food is perfectly nutritious.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.620]   In some cases, it's more nutritious because it's fresher.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:45.780]   When a food processor freezes food, they harvest it and they do their best to harvest it at
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:52.920]   the height of freshness and then it's very quickly flash frozen, which should result
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.820]   in the maintenance of all of the nutrition.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.120]   If you leave the food, it may be fresh, but if you leave it and if it starts to break
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:06.660]   down over time, then that broken down food, it loses some of its nutritional quality if
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.060]   it's not preserved properly.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.620]   It's also very helpful for me to maintain my freshness if I can purchase frozen food
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.460]   as compared to fresh food.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.660]   It also will help to cut down on spoilage and wastage.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.780]   I hate wasting food.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.780]   Unfortunately, if you buy large quantities of food that spoils, like large quantities
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   of vegetables, frequently you'll find that something goes bad on you because you just
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   didn't get around to it.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.380]   You planned your menu, but then you wound up eating out more or going to friends' houses
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.740]   more than you anticipated.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.780]   Next time you turn around, your green beans are black and moldy and you can try to save
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.460]   them at some point, but at some point, you just have to toss them.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.420]   That's annoying to me, but it's also costly.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.540]   It also costs more.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.980]   That's a major component in many of our budgets, thankfully.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:00.020]   Most of our budgets are significantly larger than the failure of some green bean storage,
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.380]   but it's an unnecessary waste.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.280]   I don't like to waste valuable food.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.740]   Buying something frozen, if you get it cheaper up front, maintains the same nutritional quantity,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.700]   has less spoilage, and in this case, in the case of green beans, could actually be an
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:20.940]   organic product which can help to encourage the organic food industry, which I'd like
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:27.660]   to see more of, to encourage companies to move in that direction.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.660]   That's great.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.340]   Now, on the flip side, here would be a counter example with a price book, which is pricing
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.600]   out sweet potatoes.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:42.500]   At Costco, you can buy a 10-pound bag of sweet potatoes for $0.78 a pound, but at the same
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:50.700]   grocery store that I was shopping at, you could buy sweet potatoes for $0.49 a pound.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.580]   The only measurable difference between them was that the Costco sweet potatoes are larger,
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:00.540]   which could be a virtue if you were either using a recipe in which those were more valuable,
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.500]   you're eating stuffed sweet potatoes, something where you wanted them to have a stronger,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.580]   bigger skin that you could take them out and then stuff them back in, or if you needed
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.340]   a big sweet potato, but in my case, I don't need a big sweet potato and they're the same
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.620]   product.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.180]   Instead of essentially $0.80 a pound at Costco, you can buy them for $0.50 a pound at the
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.180]   grocery store.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.140]   Now, of course, I also priced in the 40-pound box at the restaurant supply store and that
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.340]   comes out to be cheaper than either of those.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.740]   Let me give that as a good example.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.500]   Let's talk about eggs.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.540]   One of the valuable things about a price book is starting to understand if you get a benefit
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.300]   from a bulk buy.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.900]   I have frequently in the past purchased – my family in the past, we've eaten a lot of
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.900]   eggs.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.900]   We've pulled back on our egg consumption recently, but we've eaten a lot of eggs.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.660]   At different times, I either buy the fancy and high-quality eggs or the cheaper eggs
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.660]   that are mass-produced.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.620]   I'd love to have a source for better quality eggs.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.900]   My preference would be that all of my eggs came from my chickens scratching around in
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.780]   my backyard, eating nothing but bugs and what they find out in the wild and a little bit
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.700]   of supplemental high-quality feed.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.240]   But until I can get back to that solution, then I got to figure out where do I get my
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.340]   eggs from and it's hard to find a local producer that gives any decent quality and
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:16.220]   so I'm restrained to purchasing eggs through the standard means.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.180]   I frequently in the past purchased boxes of 15 or even 30 dozen eggs at the restaurant
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.020]   supply store because they were inexpensive.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:32.260]   That's fine as far as saving on a per egg cost, but it's extremely inconvenient to
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:38.560]   have 15 or 30 dozen eggs filling up your refrigerator.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.140]   That's very inconvenient.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.980]   I did the calculations and I found out that if I were to buy 30 dozen eggs at the restaurant
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.300]   supply store for 10 cents an egg, I could do that.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.780]   That was the cheapest price total.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:59.780]   But I could also go down to Walmart and purchase the exact same generic conventional eggs at
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.620]   the same 10 cents per egg cost and I could buy them in packs of 18.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.300]   Now I don't like the Walmart packaging because it's all styrofoam.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.700]   I prefer a cardboard or a less package intensive use.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.980]   But in essence in terms of the cost, it's the same cost, 10 cents an egg.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:22.240]   A lot more convenient for me to buy eggs 18 at a time and store a couple packages of those
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.360]   than to buy 15 or 30 dozen eggs at the restaurant supply store.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.600]   By the way, if you're interested, this also gives you the data to compare perhaps a higher
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.660]   quality form of egg.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:40.500]   So I can no longer buy packages of the same inexpensive eggs at the local Costco but you
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.620]   can purchase – they have more of the higher quality ones.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:47.220]   Their basic cage-free option, which whatever that means is one of those things where until
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.840]   I've actually been to the farm, I don't trust the labels.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.540]   But I'm sure that Costco is doing their best.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.540]   A cage-free set of eggs at Costco comes out to 14 cents an egg.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.540]   So you can calculate.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.380]   Do I get additional benefits?
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.500]   Is this additional cost worthy of me supporting it, paying my money as a nutritional?
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.340]   Is there an additional nutritional value there?
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.920]   Is there an additional ethical value there of encouraging cage-free egg production instead
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.820]   of standard egg production, which is pretty atrocious?
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.660]   You get that info from the data.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.860]   You can also calculate then your daily cost of egg and it's a lot easier to do that
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.420]   if you know that each egg is 10 cents and your family uses a dozen a day.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.180]   There's $1.20 every time you make eggs.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.940]   Good data to have.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.620]   A couple of other interesting examples would be something like bagels.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.980]   I recently had purchased some bagels as a special treat for my family down at one of
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.380]   the local discount food stores.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.220]   It was a day-old bread store and I popped in there and I thought I was getting a good
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.220]   deal.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   I got two packs for four bucks.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.140]   They came out to be 40 cents each.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.140]   But I also found however that it wasn't that good of a deal.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:55.460]   At Costco, I could purchase them for 42 cents each and actually a bigger bagel.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.100]   But I found the cheapest price there was actually Walmart at 31 cents a bagel for a cinnamon
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.120]   raisin bagel.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:07.260]   One more interesting example that was surprising to me was chips, tortilla chips.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:14.260]   I hate buying chips, period, because they're just – in my mind, one of the most overpriced,
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.740]   non-valuable food items that we love in our culture.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.140]   They're bad for you.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.340]   They have almost no nutritional content.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.800]   They taste great but they're crazy expensive.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.300]   But I do give in on tortilla chips, enjoy eating tortilla chips and the cost of tortilla
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.900]   chips is so much lower than some of the other ones that I think it's reasonable.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.300]   The cheapest source that I had found for tortilla chips was the restaurant supply store where
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.820]   for $1.59, I could get a 12-ounce bag of tortilla chips.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.380]   It comes out to 13 cents an ounce.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:44.660]   But when I did the math, I actually found that the Kirkland brand at Costco, their organic
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.220]   tortilla chips they sell comes out to 12 cents an ounce.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.740]   Cheaper, very delicious chips and organic.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.220]   That's what a price book tells you.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:03.780]   If you start to integrate the use of a price book with nothing more than the cost of a
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:10.380]   little bit of time up front, you'll make smarter buying decisions.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:15.140]   This can substantially help you to cut your bills.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:20.260]   Now here are some tips for you on how to actually do this and how to turbocharge your results.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.300]   First, I recommend that you track everything as long as you're not the kind of person that
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.260]   gets overwhelmed by that.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.100]   I don't get overwhelmed by data.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.100]   I enjoy it.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.580]   I enjoy the minutiae.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.580]   It's fun for me.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.840]   I'm a nerd.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   It's fun.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.180]   I enjoy knowing that an egg costs 10 cents.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.740]   So if I'm going to make a breakfast of scrambled eggs and we're going to have 15 eggs, then
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.220]   there's $1.50 in eggs and 32 cents of cheese.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.500]   I think that's interesting.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   I think it's fun.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.900]   A lot of people don't.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.780]   So if you're the kind of person who is totally overwhelmed by all this data and all this
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:35:00.180]   minutiae, just start taking notes on a few things and just keep it very, very simple.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.220]   But do go ahead and start tracking some things.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.140]   If my systems don't work for you, figure out some system, but write some things down and
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.300]   start to track them.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.260]   So at least with your normal decisions, you can start to know where you get your best
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.480]   deal and do it on the stuff that you regularly consume.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.940]   Many of us know, "Hey, there's a shirt.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.240]   Let me go ahead and pick up that shirt and buy it."
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:30.100]   We know what our price is for a shirt or a pair of shoes or something like that.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.060]   But we often don't know it when it comes to jars of peanut butter.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:39.420]   Another big benefit of maintaining a price book is you'll automatically start to delay
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.300]   your purchases a little bit.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:51.660]   It's very valuable for you in controlling your outflow to stop and to think before you
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.300]   spend money.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:36:00.060]   Impulse buying destroys many people's budgets.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:07.060]   One of the very good methodologies of controlling impulse buying is to give yourself a time
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.200]   delay.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.220]   You can buy anything you want.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.620]   Give yourself a rule like this.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.620]   You can buy yourself anything you want as long as you have the money for it and as long
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.180]   as you write it down on a list and leave it there on the list for an appropriate period
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180]   of time.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.180]   Maybe it's seven days.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.020]   Maybe it's 30 days, something like that.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.620]   Different people have come up with different rules.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.620]   Anything you want in excess of $20, et cetera.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:38.040]   But the point is by writing something down on a list that you want to buy and not impulse
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:44.260]   buying it, you can have the enjoyment of knowing that you're probably going to be able to buy
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.580]   it but you can also give time for your emotions to die down so you don't have so much buyer's
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.580]   remorse.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:55.940]   Interestingly, the research psychologists related to money have found that this actually
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.660]   enhances people's enjoyment of the things that they do buy.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.420]   Part of the fun of buying things is the anticipation of buying it, the waiting for it, and then
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.780]   the enjoying it when you have it.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.820]   If you just buy everything all the time, things quickly – they lose some of their emotional
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820]   enjoyment.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.980]   So one of the bits of data that I've seen in the money psychology perspective has been
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.940]   if you want to increase your enjoyment of things, put limits on yourself and give yourself
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.220]   time to wait.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.060]   Put down a buy list so that you wait.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:30.500]   Well, tracking the prices of things and putting it in your price book gives you in essence
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.700]   an automatic buy list where you're writing something down and doing your research in
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   it.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.060]   So feel free to put anything in there.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:41.540]   If you need a new air compressor for your shop, write it down and start looking around
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.820]   and shopping.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.460]   It also gives you an idea of what your solutions are.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.740]   That's really, really valuable.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:56.640]   It's good for you to price different options and to know different things that are available
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   to you.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.500]   Don't restrict it to just the new stores.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.540]   Example, shirts.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.420]   My preferred shirt – I don't enjoy wearing t-shirts.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.500]   I prefer to wear a button-down shirt.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   In my mind, they're more comfortable.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.340]   They're more comfortable because they just naturally look better.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.340]   They make me feel better.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.700]   They make me feel more confident and I prefer to have a pocket.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.300]   Years ago, I started buying Brooks Brothers button-down shirts.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.660]   It's a superior shirt, good fabric quality and the most important thing is that the Brooks
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:31.500]   Brothers non-iron shirts are – they don't need – obviously, they don't need ironing
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.660]   but they're actually a good non-iron shirt.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.620]   Now there are other ones that are excellent as well and I've purchased a number of different
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:41.100]   brands but the great thing about a Brooks Brothers non-iron shirt is that you know you
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:49.860]   can just count on that tag and it's a pretty good quality but they cost 80 bucks new.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.820]   I would consider doing that if I had a job where again I was wearing a suit every day.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:58.980]   I would consider doing that but I would probably wait for the once a year sale and get it for
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.180]   60 bucks new.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.140]   But I'm also well aware that if I just go into the local thrift store as I did just
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.380]   recently and go into the local thrift store, I can go in and I can find regularly Brooks
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:17.980]   Brothers shirts for 5 bucks each on the sale day and they're perfectly fine.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.500]   It takes almost no time to go into the local thrift store and when you know a brand that
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.980]   you're looking for, I just go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom right through.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.660]   You find the tag, find the tag, find the next size.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.780]   If the next size fits me, I know it will fit me.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.260]   So brand, choice, 5 bucks, out the door, done.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:41.500]   That $5 becomes the buy price for shirts, for me anyway.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.180]   Then anytime it's cheaper than that, you stock up.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.260]   Anytime it's more expensive, you don't.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.800]   But by writing it down and knowing the difference, now I'm going to have extra incentive to go
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.100]   to the thrift store instead of just going to the Brooks Brothers store.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.660]   Let me point out one quick thing on that strategy for shirt buying.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.340]   The only reason that works for me, the only reason that I can actually purchase things
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:08.380]   like that at the thrift store is because in the way that I wear the shirts, sleeve length
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.100]   doesn't matter.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:16.460]   For men's shirts, the big thing is fit and that fit has to come down to neck size and
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.460]   sleeve length.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.260]   Those are the big things and I have unusual sizes.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:26.820]   So I can almost never find an appropriate neck size and sleeve length in my actual size
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.140]   in a thrift store.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.860]   But since I'm not currently wearing ties, the neck size is less important.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.100]   Since I don't currently wear a suit coat every day, the sleeve length is less important
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.980]   and 99.5% of the time, I roll up the sleeves anyway.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:46.140]   So I can find the shirts with an appropriate body size at $5 each.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.020]   I couldn't do that if I were in a professional environment wearing a suit every day where
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:56.300]   I needed neck size and sleeve length to be proper, which is another example of substitution
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.860]   to show that there are certain things that are valuable.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:05.620]   To me, the valuable thing is fabric quality, non-iron, having a decent reasonably attractive
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.020]   shirt that's comfortable.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.800]   But by way of substitution, you can change out those neck size and sleeve length, which
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.980]   are crucial in a professional environment but not crucial in my current environment.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.700]   I guess if I'm in a non-professional environment, what does that mean?
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.700]   I don't know what that means to you.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.600]   Back to tips.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.380]   This type of shopping is time intensive up front, especially if you've never done it.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.780]   It takes time to do this.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.220]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:41.280]   Remember, you're talking about saving money and my personal goal is to cut $2,000 off
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.860]   my grocery budget this year.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:48.180]   Now, $2,000 off my grocery budget, what does that actually mean?
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.180]   Well, first of all, I can't deduct my groceries.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.900]   So I'd have to automatically add to my $2,000 grocery budget.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:06.420]   I'd have to automatically add whatever I have to earn in pre-tax wages or profits in order
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.380]   to pay those groceries.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.020]   Let's say that I were at a 30% effective tax rate.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:19.860]   Well, that means that I have to earn $2,600 in order to pay for that $2,000 of groceries.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.500]   It's a lot of money.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.220]   Now, pretend that I want to do that in retirement.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:28.700]   Well, let's take 25 times $2,600.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:42.060]   In order for me to support a habit of an extra $2,000 of expenditures in financial independence,
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.900]   I would need to have $65,000 in the bank.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.700]   The way I got there is just take your annual expenditure.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:55.900]   In this case, because I went ahead and used the $2,600 number to account for income taxes,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.580]   that would change, but – and multiply it times 25 and that gives me the amount of money
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:05.860]   that I would need in savings in order to support that on an annual basis.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.200]   That's $65,000.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:14.620]   So is it worth me investing, say, 10 to 15 hours of time over the first couple of months
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:22.200]   to build this, to avoid my having to build a nest egg of $65,000 because I was sloppy
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   with my spending?
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.900]   Absolutely, it's worth it.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.920]   Then once I've invested that, say, 10 to 15 to 20 hours of time, I've looked around
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.380]   some different stores, I've looked for deals, and then I established my baseline in each
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:38.660]   category, there's no additional time required to maintain it or to look at it.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.180]   I just simply have my own data.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.180]   I look.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.180]   Is this a good deal?
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.180]   I move on.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:47.260]   So it's only time-intensive up front, but over time it doesn't add additional time
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.260]   to your schedule.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:54.660]   It's worth the money – sorry, worth the effort and it'll save you money.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.860]   Group things in a way that makes sense to you.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.980]   Don't go with other people's categories.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.240]   Make up your own and be willing to change them.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.860]   In our household, we don't eat a lot of bread.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:10.560]   So for me, bread is just one giant fill-all page.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.680]   That includes bread, bagels, tortillas, all of the above because I'm not regularly shopping
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   for different kinds of bread.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.500]   It's just an every now and then occasional purchase.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.780]   But for you, maybe bread is very important and you're going to put on there where you
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.460]   get your French bread and where you get your Italian bread and where you get your harvest
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.220]   oat bread and then you're going to calculate how much it costs you to make bread and you're
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.060]   going to have a page for bread and a page for bagels and a page for tortillas and you're
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.840]   going to have all that data.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.160]   Use it for you.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:47.020]   Another example for me, I put things like oats, rolled oats, steel-cut oats and granola
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.200]   all on the same page.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.780]   The granola of course is obviously going to be more expensive because it's a value-added
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:57.180]   product but I put it on the same page so I can calculate the cost of making my own granola
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.160]   – rolled oats, raisins, a little bit of sugar, honey and you're basically done – versus
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.060]   purchasing the pre-manufactured solutions and running that.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:11.960]   So I don't mind grouping the bulk ingredients and the value-added retail product together
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.080]   because they form the same function.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.120]   Group things in a way that makes sense to you.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.240]   Recognize a danger of buying big packages.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.480]   Sometimes big packages result in your using more.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:37.360]   And so either account for that in your usage standard or make a different choice.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.720]   Example from my life would be cheese.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:45.440]   I buy big blocks of cheese from restaurant supply store or different places because they're
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   inexpensive.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.480]   That's the cheapest way to get them.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.920]   But recently, we had bought a tiny little block of cheese from Aldi and I was putting
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.640]   it on the eggs and I realized that I put about half as much – I shredded about half as
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.240]   much cheese onto our scrambled eggs with the small block as I do with the big block.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.640]   And I realized that just having that big block of cheese results in my being more liberal
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   with the amount that I use.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.160]   Well, that's not going to save you money.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.440]   And if it's something that you don't necessarily need more of – I don't need more calories
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.920]   from cheese, I don't need to have tons of cheese on it – then sometimes choosing that
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.600]   smaller package will actually be a saving.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.560]   So recognize that sometimes having a big package will result in you using more.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.760]   If you buy a 30-pound box of raisins or you buy a little 16-ounce container of raisins,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.560]   you're probably going to be less liberal with a 30-pound box.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.680]   Sorry, wrong way.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.560]   You're going to use too many with a 30-pound box.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.640]   So package it up yourself.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.440]   Factor in all of your costs to your price book.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:53.580]   So for example, maybe you have to pay a warehouse club membership fee or there's a distance
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.840]   to drive.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.520]   Remember, those things can be mitigated.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.440]   A warehouse membership club fee can be particularly valuable if you're going to get substantial
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   savings.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.040]   If you're going to drive a far away away, then make sure that you're doing that when
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.720]   you're actually driving there for other purposes.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.880]   If you're just getting started, then just ignore some of those things until you get
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   an idea.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.000]   But after you've figured out what your baseline is or if you have certain products that are
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.520]   similar, figure out, "Was it more convenient for me just to buy this here?
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.680]   Because I can do it in one place or it's close to my house.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.500]   I don't have to make three stops or because I can avoid a membership fee."
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.840]   In the same way, factor in all of your savings.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.320]   This is probably going to be done after the case.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:44.720]   But stack in any kind of specific store discount that you may have or a specific buying strategy.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.440]   If you're shopping at Target and you have their Target credit card that gives you 5%
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.760]   back on all your purchases, then in that case, you may be able to look at the Target price
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.800]   and you need to factor in the fact that that's 5% cheaper with the use of that card.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   If you were to go down to your Aldi, then you don't have an Aldi card, then maybe it's
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   going to be 5% more.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.880]   When you can start to stack things together using Target as an example, Target from time
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.800]   to time will have decent store discounts.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:20.640]   Target will accept coupons, manufacturer's coupons, and they'll do some price matching
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   and other competitor coupons.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:32.280]   If you can stack together a store discount with a coupon with the Target 5% credit card,
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:38.640]   now all of a sudden you start to have compelling benefits to using that particular store.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   Remember those things.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.520]   Then what I would do is encourage you to put down in your price book the stacking that
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.920]   you did.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.240]   Recently I purchased some diapers at Target.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:57.600]   I was able to use a manufacturer's coupon and a rebate and use a Target 5% discount
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   credit card.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:04.040]   Well, after the fact, I went and I calculated the whole cost of the transaction per diaper
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:12.880]   and then I figured out what the net cost per diaper was.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.600]   That allowed me to set a new baseline for that diaper.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.360]   We used cloth diapers with the exception of one child at night.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.160]   Cloth diapers don't do well for her at night.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.880]   Now in this case, I'll go ahead and just tell you about that transaction because it demonstrates
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:39.720]   how the data gives you the solutions and how you need to calculate a few different options.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.640]   Buying the diapers at Target was not the cheapest place to get diapers.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.920]   The cheapest place to get diapers would be the standard – would be the Costco, the
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   Kirkland brand of diapers.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.240]   The problem is that those are conventional diapers which have a lot more chemicals in
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.760]   them which we do our best to avoid for our children.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:03.200]   One of the benefits of cloth diapering is that it's much less – many fewer toxins
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.720]   exposed to little babies and sensitive parts of their skin.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:15.680]   But there are multiple competing brands of diapers that advertise themselves as being
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.360]   this junk-free brand of disposable diaper.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.880]   The two brands that are the most common are Honest Brand and Seventh Generation.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.240]   You can sit there in front of Target and – this is what I did.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.920]   I went through all the math of the Honest Brand versus the Seventh Generation and figured
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.560]   out that on the whole, every single time, the Seventh Generation is cheaper.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.200]   To my knowledge, I'm not aware of any inherent product characteristics that would make the
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.600]   Honest Brand superior such that I'd be willing to pay extra money.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.280]   I'm already paying extra money to have a less toxic diaper.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.440]   But in this case, why not go with the less expensive, less toxic diaper instead of the
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.620]   more expensive, less toxic diaper?
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:02.520]   The next thing is to look – and the benefit of doing that at Target was when I was doing
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:11.080]   this math, they were offering the same rebate on all of the choices, which included Honest
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.600]   Brand and Seventh Generation.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   The next thing is looking at the sizing and sometimes with diaper sizing, you can calculate
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.080]   the savings per size.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:26.320]   And then – so if your child is on an in-between and you can stretch one size or the other,
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.840]   go with the one that has the – that's a smaller size.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.200]   If you can do it without – before the child outgrows it and save per cost.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.720]   And then stack that onto the rebate and then stack that onto the store 5% card and you
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:45.960]   wind up with – I wound up with the least expensive option possible.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.920]   So whenever possible, try to look for those multiple avenues.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:55.360]   Now, it still came out, again, more expensive than Costco for a size 6 with that transaction
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:02.480]   I paid 49 cents each, whereas the standard Kirkland size 6 would be 32 cents each.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.680]   That's a big difference there.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.120]   But that was the choice that we made.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:12.280]   And so you can make whatever choice you need to do based upon your personal values that
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.600]   you have and the constraints that you put upon your expenditures.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.640]   Use those coupons.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.140]   Use the price-matching policies.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.880]   Many stores will always match a coupon price or an advertised price from somewhere else.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.240]   So if you're paying attention in your price book and you notice that the grocery store
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:32.200]   has a cheaper price on the item and it's advertised but you don't want to go to the
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:37.360]   grocery store to just get that item, well, take that advertisement into your other store.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.800]   Take it into Walmart and ask them to match the price and that can work well.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.240]   Don't forget the internet.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.460]   One of the values of having this written down is that you can come home and then use the
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.200]   internet and sometimes the internet will save you money.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   Think through this.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   Exactly the same things.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:56.480]   Amazon, I don't use this but if some of you – because our diaper purchase is more occasional
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.160]   given that we use cloth diapers in our family.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:05.820]   But if you're a regular user of disposable diapers, then look into the stacking up of
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:10.760]   Amazon and subscribe and save and the Amazon credit card, etc., and see what your unit
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.880]   price comes out to.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   Stock up when it's the right time and the right price.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.520]   And some things it's easier to do.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.960]   Some things you have to do more work.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:26.840]   Peanut butter is something that I found is important to stock up on.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:32.160]   We like to have just the peanut butter that's just peanuts and salt and that's hard to
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.160]   find.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.280]   Most of the peanut butter has sugar in it.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.320]   So we try to avoid the sugar.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.480]   For years, it was just standard.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.320]   I used a public store brand and that was just the easiest thing to do.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.440]   But then publics discontinued their store brand, which has left us with the only solution
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:49.880]   being a Smucker's natural product line that they have for that particular type of peanut
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   butter.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.960]   So of course I can buy giant tubs of it at the restaurant supply store.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.680]   I can buy the Kirkland brand at Costco, which I don't care for.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.400]   So I just knock that off.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.680]   But still that calculates per unit cost.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.960]   With a rebate, I recently found a deal on peanut butter that with the rebate, it's
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.800]   cheaper than the giant tubs of the junky stuff at the restaurant supply store.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.400]   In that case, clear the shelf.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.840]   There have been times I've come home with 20 jars of peanut butter.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.520]   Lasts a long time.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.160]   Certainly not going to go bad in my usage schedule.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   So stock up.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   That's easy.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.120]   Some things, of course, it's not so easy.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.080]   But it may be worth in your best interest to think through a little bit.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.420]   Put some stuff in Ziploc bags.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:30.420]   Use some Tupperwares.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.420]   Use your freezer.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.880]   In some cases, use a food saver, a vacuum sealer.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.640]   Maybe for some people, it's worth it to do home canning.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:44.880]   I think that unless you live in an agricultural area where you can have access to huge quantities
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.080]   of much discounted produce, I think canning is so labor-intensive.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   I've done it and I've done it with meats.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.360]   But I don't have a source of those vegetables.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   But maybe you do.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:01.160]   In which case, you can do home canning and that will produce much better solutions for
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.160]   you.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.800]   What I found with home canning is I can use that for meat.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:09.440]   I can go and purchase 40-pound boxes of chicken at 58 cents a pound at the restaurant supply
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:16.920]   store and by going ahead and canning it, then I can get the value of that price for a long
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:24.560]   period of time and in a way that I wouldn't ordinarily be able to use 40 pounds of chicken.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.240]   Then finally, don't forget to extend the life of things whenever possible.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.080]   Just because you got it cheap doesn't mean you should waste it.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:36.840]   So look for all those ways to use something less and to extend its life through better
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   care and maintenance.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.900]   And you can do this to many different things.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.480]   From time to time, just pick something that you're purchasing and do a web search and
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.880]   try to figure out how to extend the life of something.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.000]   If you find yourself buying disposable razors, search "how to extend the life of your razors"
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.080]   and you'll find that with something like a razor, you can oil the blade so it doesn't
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.560]   rust or store it in oil.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   I've done that.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.800]   You can strop it on a towel, on a leather strop if you use that or just a pair of blue
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.240]   jeans or an old blue jeans.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.440]   You can strop your razors and make them last longer.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:17.080]   You can get 50% or 100% more lifespan out of your razors with just a little bit of use.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.600]   If you're buying shoes, how to extend the life of your shoes.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.840]   Maybe it's time to get a pair of shoe trees or maybe it's time to change.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.880]   When I was younger, I used to drag my feet and that resulted in the back of my shoes
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.320]   being worn down.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.640]   Well, that's dumb.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:36.000]   Fix the problem of the habit, the bad habit, and that makes your shoes last longer.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.320]   All those things result in your having a lower total cost of ownership like we discussed
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:46.200]   in last week's show where we talked about how to save money, buy it cheaper, make it
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.840]   last longer and use it less.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.600]   I close with this question.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.720]   Is this important?
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.240]   Is this worth your time?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:04.000]   The examples that I'm using from groceries, on the whole, each individual one is not that
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.120]   big a deal.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:13.500]   Is it really going to matter in your budget that you can get Costco organic tortilla chips
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:21.120]   at 12 cents an ounce instead of 13 cents an ounce at the restaurant supply store?
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:28.800]   Obviously, if the question is, does saving that extra one cent per ounce going to make
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:36.440]   you be broken in debt at the end of the year if you buy a bag of chips every few weeks?
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   No, of course not.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   We're grand total.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.160]   We're talking about a couple of dollars.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.440]   But I don't think that's the only way to look at it.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.920]   Number one, we're dealing with a skill here.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.680]   Once you've developed that skill, that skill can be applied to every other area of your
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.320]   life.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.640]   Skills come with practice and all of these little transactions give you a chance to practice.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:08.160]   When I outline this, it sounds very complicated.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.240]   I'm good at taking something simple and making it sound very complicated.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.480]   But let me collapse this down to the simple.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:21.920]   All it practically means is now I know that tortilla chips at Costco are cheap.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.680]   I'm going to make that my standard tortilla chip that we buy when we need chips.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.240]   When they do put them on rebate, I'm going to grab a few extra bags because they'll last
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:32.840]   for probably a couple of months and that way I have some extra bags.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   That's it.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.000]   It doesn't require any more time.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.560]   I may be at Costco anyway.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   It doesn't require any more effort and it's perfectly fine to go ahead and buy another
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:44.920]   bag of the other chips from the store next to my house if that's what I need sometime
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.760]   just to make up for a recipe or to have a little snack.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.960]   So when we go through all the mechanics of this, it sounds very complicated but in actuality
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.320]   it's very simple and the knowledge is simple.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:04.240]   But all these little things do matter because they demonstrate you developing skills.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:13.080]   As you develop and practice those skills, they will translate over to bigger areas.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:22.600]   Many people when they buy a car, believe it or not, do actually just go to the car dealership
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.160]   and buy the car.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.400]   They don't research it.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.800]   They don't pit dealers against one another.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   They don't put competitors.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.640]   They just go and buy the car.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   You don't believe me?
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.120]   Just start helping people with their money and you will find that that's exactly what
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.800]   happens.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.920]   I didn't know that people ever bought cars from buy here, pay here places.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:48.960]   You see them on the side of the road but it was so – it was anathema to me to think
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.760]   that I would go to a buy here, pay here used car store to buy a car.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.720]   So I didn't know that anybody actually did it.
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.200]   Until a number of years ago, my parents took in a young lady who was in difficult circumstances
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.560]   and she lived with us for a while and they were helping her and I found out that she
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.480]   had bought one of their cars and it was a nightmare of a deal.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:16.800]   I forget detail of numbers but basically she wound up paying $5,000 for a $1,500 car.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:24.960]   It was a measure of ignorance and naivety and just a tough situation.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.360]   But many people actually do that.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.960]   So who doesn't do that?
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.640]   Well, the type of person who knows to do research and there are different levels of this.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   It is very much probably more important if you're going to buy a car this year and
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.440]   that's something that you need to do.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.520]   It's more important if you've only got 20 hours to spend.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.320]   It's more important for you to spend those 20 hours getting the best possible deal on
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.840]   your prospective car than it is for you to figure out how to save money on your tortilla
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:03.720]   chips because you can save thousands and thousands of dollars off the cost of your car with research
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:10.600]   and negotiation where you may only save $10 this year on the cost of your tortilla chips.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.800]   If you have to choose, focus on the tortilla chips.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.760]   My observation has been that very few people only have enough time to save money on their
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.880]   car.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.560]   Whether you're the type of person who knows that saving money is valuable and you look
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:34.160]   for little strategies on just about everything and that leads you to save money on your car
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.520]   or you may just tend to be the kind of person who just pays whatever is in front of you.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.560]   I was talking with my wife about this the other night.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.560]   There are a couple of gas stations by my house that I do not understand how they pay it there
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.440]   in business because they charge $0.30 a gallon more than the gas station that I use which
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.240]   is about a mile and a half away.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.200]   I don't understand where they get their business from and I just look around and I think they
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.060]   don't offer anything in terms of the quality of the product.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:07.080]   They don't offer anything in terms of the layout.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.960]   It's not that I shop at the nasty dangerous gas station and these are nice.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.000]   So the same product, the cheap gas station has a better environment.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.120]   The location, I don't see that they're offering anything in terms of location that's all that
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.480]   superior.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.080]   It just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.800]   But yet all the time I see people there putting gas in their car.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.440]   I would understand if we were maybe in a tourist district or there were lots of travelers or
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.400]   this were one of those things where it was a matter of convenience just getting off the
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.080]   highway but none of those things apply.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   It's a mystery of life to me how these gas stations stay in business.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.160]   Just for me, it makes sense that I'm the kind of person who's going to look for a deal and
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:54.280]   since I'm constantly driving past the one that's cheaper and better and more convenient
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:03:01.080]   but it happens to be a mile away and it saves me 30 cents a gallon, I'll just use that one.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.560]   Back to the car.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.680]   All these little saving strategies have many more opportunities for you to use than buying
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680]   a car.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.240]   What are you going to buy a car once every five years if you have multiple cars, once
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.480]   every 10 years if you have one car?
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.760]   A car these days should last you 10 to 20 years.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.680]   So you can only do that about one time.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:30.040]   Whereas all these little things have lots of uses and it doesn't take any more time.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.200]   Next reason it's important is just that there are lots more strategies for all these things
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:41.040]   and they're much less efficient markets than some of the big strategies.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.640]   I'm so thankful the new car marketplace has become much more efficient in the last few
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.640]   years.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.920]   I've watched it carefully.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:55.520]   With your ability to deal with things, with virtual bidding, with access to information,
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.760]   the new car market has become much more efficient.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.920]   If you're going to buy a new car, it's relatively easy for you to get a decent deal and there
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.640]   aren't that many strategies for you to save.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.600]   But the vegetable marketplace and the fruit marketplace and the bread marketplace is pretty
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.240]   inefficient nearby you.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.920]   You can use these strategies.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.600]   There are tons of them.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.960]   They're all over the place.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:28.520]   The actual amount of investment of time is just tiny and it's good practice for you to
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.720]   be ready for those big things.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.280]   It's a good experience for you.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.880]   It's a good experience for your children.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:43.160]   The way that you train your children, especially as regards money, will drive them in the direction
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.240]   that they will pursue as young adults and as adults.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   That's your responsibility.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:54.080]   So I just close with two little stories that perhaps you'll think are funny but they're
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.200]   real stories from my life here in the last week.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.600]   I guess I'll go ahead and – I'll tell the whole story because it's fun.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.760]   Especially those of you who are tightwads and enjoy fun strategies, you'll enjoy the
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760]   fun stories.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.880]   Those of you who aren't, recognize this is fun for me.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   That's my point.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880]   Some of this stuff is fun.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.360]   I enjoy sitting down and working on my price book.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   If you don't, that's fine.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.360]   My wife doesn't.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360]   So I do it.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.480]   It's fun.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.920]   She enjoys things that I don't enjoy.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.160]   So she does some of those things.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.280]   But for me, putting some of these things together is really fun and it's really important.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.640]   I'll share the story.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:36.520]   So with regard to children's bicycles, my son – for those of you who don't know,
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.920]   with children, some of the ideas of teaching children to ride bikes has changed over the
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.120]   years.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.480]   When most of us were growing up, we started off with a tricycle and then we got a bike
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.960]   with training wheels and then in time, we would take those training wheels off and that's
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.000]   the process that many of us went through.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.120]   I have the scar on my chin to demonstrate the challenge of that.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:02.400]   The first night I rode a bike without training wheels and fell and crashed my chin open.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   But that's changed.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.160]   Now there's a popularity of something that's called a strider bike.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.760]   That's a leading brand name.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.320]   But in essence, it's a pedal-less bike that you give to little children and they learn
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.320]   to ride it around.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.140]   It's fun for them because they enjoy taking those bikes around and they can get the enjoyment
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.280]   of riding without having to deal with the pedals.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.080]   They just put their feet up and down.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.960]   And there's a very natural and easy progression.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:31.760]   So for our eldest son's first bicycle, we were actually given for his birthday, given
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.160]   one of those bicycles by a friend who their child had outgrown it and they didn't need
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   it anymore.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.360]   So they gifted it to us, which was a very great gift.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:46.280]   Of course, they asked – they have such a stupid stigma in the United States of America
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.600]   of not wanting to give things that are used.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.080]   So our friends asked in advance, "Hey, we have a used bicycle.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.920]   Would it be OK to give that because we don't need it anymore and we thought it would be
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   a good present?"
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.000]   Of course, I'd love to destroy that stigma.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.920]   I hate to see us constantly buying new things and filling up the landfill and the dump with
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.380]   just stuff that is perfectly good.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.380]   So we said yes.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.380]   We got a free bicycle up front.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.720]   And the great thing about the strider bikes is that the kids can learn to ride them.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   And we found a really great solution for entertainment that at a local BMX track – we can go to
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.760]   the local BMX track and they've built a whole side track for the strider bikes that
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.240]   you could take your two and your three and your four-year-old and have them enjoy doing
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.200]   these things while some of the older kids on their pedal bikes are out on the big track.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.840]   And so a little frugal entertainment for the children.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.320]   You might have that nearby.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.400]   Look to see if you have a BMX track with a strider bike.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.280]   This has blown up in the last couple of years in popularity and we enjoy that.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.560]   The kids really love it and we enjoy that.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:51.520]   So my son has gotten to the point where he was able to outgrow – he was in a place
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.600]   where he was ready to move up.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.880]   Now comparable buying strategy for one for my daughter.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.380]   We didn't have a second one and we waited around to see if one would show up for free
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:03.740]   and one didn't show – hasn't shown up for free.
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.280]   But she was at the point where she needed one as well.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.080]   So in that case, we had been given a number of years ago a bunch of gift cards for – a
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.400]   bunch of gift cards for Toys R Us.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:22.440]   And the problem was that we never used them because Toys R Us is just this – mostly
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.360]   this insanely expensive store with toys that your kids use for a month and they get rid
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.240]   of and we have no problem at all finding giant streams of toys that just invade our lives.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.080]   It's one of the blessings and the curses of living in the West.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.000]   You work harder to keep toys out of your house than living in your house.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.440]   I so desperately wish I could ship them all up and get them to somewhere else where the
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.000]   toys are not in such abundant supply.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   I feel embarrassed even uttering the words about it.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.840]   But that's the reality of it.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.360]   We find constant streams of toys flowing in from friends as hand-me-downs from friends
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.520]   and from family members.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.640]   We find toys constantly when we're out trash picking and dumpster diving.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.440]   They're just all over the place.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.320]   So it seems pointless to spend money down at Toys R Us, which might be why they're
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   going bankrupt.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.400]   It seems pointless to us to spend money.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.760]   And finally, we had a need for something.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.200]   We were very excited that we could use these Toys R Us gift cards that were, I think, a
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.480]   baby shower gift a number of years ago.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.720]   And so they put Strider bikes on rebate.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.600]   We were able to go and buy it and I think it cost me a dollar or two out of pocket to
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.800]   make it up, which was great.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.000]   So now we have two Strider bikes.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.120]   But going on with the frugal strategies going forward and recognize something.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   I'm describing these for fun.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:41.200]   I think most people who know me in person wouldn't necessarily know me as being a weirdo
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   tightwad.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.040]   I don't think that's the case, although I don't mind a little bit of that.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.280]   But I think there are – I'm uncomfortable with being too radical or too extreme in some
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.540]   of those cases.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.880]   But we were waiting for a bike, waiting to see what would show up.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:01.360]   So after Christmas, some friends of ours had gotten their son, who's older than our oldest
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.300]   son, a new bicycle.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.120]   And so he had his previous one.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.040]   And so they were looking for a way to get rid of it and so we happily volunteered and
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.800]   very kindly, they offered a chance to – they said, "Hey, you want it."
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.800]   We offered to pay for it.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800]   It was a very nice bike.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.160]   But they were just happy to have it go to a good home instead of just randomly tossing
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.080]   it down to Goodwill and they were just very happy to have it go to a good home.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.080]   So we were able to get another free bicycle for my son.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.560]   But it – and we're skipping the training wheels.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.720]   I've been teaching him how to ride that, which my anecdotal experience thus far is
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.120]   I prefer the modern method of the strider bike.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.480]   It has worked well so far with one experience so far.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.120]   But it didn't have a kickstand.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.380]   So he wanted a kickstand.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:52.040]   So we went down and we were out shopping and we went down to Walmart and we priced out
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.400]   the kickstands.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.260]   And so in that chance, I showed him, "Look, here's the kickstand.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.920]   You can buy it at Walmart.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920]   Here's what it is.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.740]   It's $6.29.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.280]   So let's not buy it.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280]   Let's wait.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280]   We don't have to have it right now.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.720]   There's nothing pressing about needing a kickstand.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.840]   Let's just ride it down and see what else we can come up with and give it time."
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.200]   So we rode it down, rode down, kickstand, Walmart, $6.29.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.680]   Now my intention was to come home and check online and see is there something cheaper
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.740]   on Amazon, maybe check the local bicycle stores or anything else, any other good ideas.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.520]   But as we were on our way home, we went through our regular kind of neighborhood drive and
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.560]   lo and behold, there by the side of the road were some bikes being thrown away.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.320]   So I got out and I picked which one was the least rusty and I grabbed that, brought it
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:44.440]   home and took the kickstand off of it and took it off, cleaned up some of the rust,
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.560]   tossed the rest of the bike out.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.880]   And then with my son, I helped show him, we bolted it on his bike.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.520]   I had to cut the kickstand and modify it a little bit to make it work.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.920]   But at the end of the day, we were able to develop a perfectly functional kickstand for
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.080]   his bike.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:05.240]   And he had the lesson of deferring gratification, which was my point in this story.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.040]   He had the lesson of deferring gratification to say, "We have the money.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.900]   If he needed the money, he's got the money in his spending money.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   I have the money.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.220]   I can buy a $6.29 kickstand.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:23.520]   But what a waste to buy something new when I can just recycle something that's used and
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.640]   get a little bit more life out of that product and just stop seeing so much waste happen.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.200]   And I can teach my son delayed gratification.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:39.440]   I can teach him to think carefully, not to impulse buy, and just to take time."
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   To me, those are really valuable parenting lessons.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.240]   Those are the kind of lessons that as a parent, you really – you wish they happened every
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   day but they don't.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   You got to look for them.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.680]   You got to look for them.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.620]   But when you can find them, they're valuable.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:02.440]   Now here would be just one more fun story from a parenting perspective.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:08.280]   While ago for a birthday of my oldest son, I bought him a Nerf gun, little dart guns.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.080]   I paid full retail price for it.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.920]   I bought a brand new full retail price at – I think it was Target.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920]   He had wanted a gun like that.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.960]   One of his cousins had one and I wanted to make sure I got him one.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.400]   I think it's important for children to have toy guns when they're growing up.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.400]   This is my opinion.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.720]   It's very important from the perspective of gun safety.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:32.440]   Some of you would be horrified at how unfun I am as a father with Nerf gun.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.640]   The whole point of – for many people, Nerf gun is to shoot it at people.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:43.520]   But I don't allow my children to shoot guns at people or to – and I force on them firearm
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.520]   safety rules.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.100]   So I teach – you gun nerds will – may chuckle.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.920]   But I teach them – they always have to be pointing the gun in a safe direction.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.800]   I teach them about muzzling their legs so they're not muzzling their leg with a gun.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.280]   I'm a nut.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.820]   You know that.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:03.120]   But I think it's really valuable for children to have toy guns so they can learn all of
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.360]   those rules of gun safety.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.280]   Well, there's not even the tiniest danger of a paintball bullet or an airsoft pellet.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.320]   We're not even talking about real full velocity weapons.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.440]   We're just talking about Nerf guns.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.540]   It's allowed to shoot at anything except people and animals.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.720]   So that's the – and breakable stuff of course.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.840]   So bought him a gun for his birthday.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.200]   He loved it, super happy with it and he's enjoyed it.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.360]   Well, he decided that his handgun wasn't so great and he wanted to have a long gun.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.560]   So of course we started to go out and start pricing those things.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.760]   Well, they're 20 bucks for this piece of junk, piece of plastic that you buy at the
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   store.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.240]   So one of the great benefits of the way that I have been teaching our children to handle
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.720]   money is that they have their money.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.920]   I'm not going to buy him that.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.280]   But he has his own spending money and so – if he wants to save for it.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.720]   But thankfully he doesn't have enough money to buy it at this point.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.000]   I think it's a total waste but I think as parents, you got to let your kids waste money
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   sometimes, right?
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   So we'll see.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.440]   But the point is that we can work with him and I can say, "Hey, well, you keep saving
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.120]   and when you have enough money, then that would be the solution."
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.240]   But immediately that needs to go down on the price list.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.940]   And now he doesn't have a concept of what $20 actually represents.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.940]   But I do.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.160]   I think that's an egregious amount of money to pay for a gun that's not going to be
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:17.120]   used and you have other ones that already do the job.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.240]   But I've also got the lesson for him of looking and looking for it.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.000]   And so we can use that and say, "Well, here's what the cost is.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.680]   Let's look at some different options."
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.120]   We go different places and I'm teaching him to get the prices, have it in his head
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.240]   and then we're looking at all of the options.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:39.040]   And so just last night, looking in a local dumpster, found a perfectly serviceable gun
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.600]   for now.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.440]   And now he got the joy of saying, "Hey, I can have this one for free."
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.440]   Now it's not perfect.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.640]   We're still waiting on one that shoots darts.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.280]   This one doesn't shoot darts.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.360]   But it's part of it and it's a really important and valuable lesson for him to learn to delay
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360]   gratification.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.120]   Yes, you'd like to have that but let's look for alternatives.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.440]   Let's look for something that's free.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.280]   Let's look for something that can be repurposed.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   Let's wait.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.320]   Let's shop the used market.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.640]   Those things are everywhere.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.840]   It will show up on the trash pile.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.320]   There's no reason for him to waste his $20 on a new one.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:15.720]   Remember to write it down, put it in the price book and start comparing things while waiting
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.480]   to see where you find the best option.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.320]   Maybe the best option will come from a store.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.720]   Maybe it will come from a yard sale.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.360]   Maybe it will come from the thrift store.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.760]   Maybe it will come from a trash heap.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.040]   Doesn't matter.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.920]   It's the principle in the skill development.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.460]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.480]   That's what I'm teaching my children.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.440]   Did your parents teach you that?
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.600]   Or did you have to learn it as an adult?
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.960]   Or do you need to learn it as an adult?
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:56.080]   I don't honestly think that you being able to buy tortilla chips for $0.12 an ounce instead
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.320]   of $0.13 an ounce is going to make you wealthy.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:07.080]   I do honestly think that if you'll implement a price book and start using it, you could
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.360]   save probably a thousand or a couple thousand or for some of you multiple thousands of dollars
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.520]   off of your grocery budget this year and everything else that you buy.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.840]   I do think that over the coming decades if you'll implement those skills, it'll save
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.400]   you tens of thousands of dollars.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:32.200]   I do think that that simple habit and practice of shopping carefully for groceries will develop
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:39.560]   in you a character to look for deals on other things.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.920]   I do think that that will lead to much increased wealth.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:56.080]   As the things that you buy change from $0.12 tortilla chips to $120,000 sailing boats,
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.240]   your life will change and you'll be able to afford those sailing boats because you saved
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.700]   on tortilla chips.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.240]   It's not the $4 or the $10 a year you saved on tortilla chips.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.760]   It's how you saved on it and how you built those skills.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.360]   Do you know what I notice about Costco?
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:20.400]   There are very few broken down beat up cars in the driveway or in the parking lot.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.680]   At least at my Costco, I usually park next to a Lexus on one side and a Mercedes Benz
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.040]   on the other.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.440]   Now causation correlation, how does that all work?
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.440]   I don't know.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:35.840]   But I know there aren't a lot of people in there.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.120]   Is that because they sell a lot of organic fancy stuff?
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.120]   Maybe.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.000]   Is that because it's hard to get out of there for less than a hundred bucks because of the
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   unit sizes?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   Maybe.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.960]   But you can get some great deals there.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.920]   But the rich people are there shopping.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:54.240]   The habits you put in now are the same habits that will help you get deals on multimillion
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.960]   dollar deals years from now.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.080]   Do not despise the day of small beginnings.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.680]   Don't despise the day of small beginnings.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.800]   You need that – by the way, that's an allusion to the book of Zechariah.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.480]   You need those skills developed in time.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.480]   Here's my final thing.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:19.000]   I don't think that getting tortilla chips for 12 cents an ounce instead of 13 ounces
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.520]   is going to make you rich this year.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:34.800]   But I do think that your kids understand tortilla chips and that by modeling the practice of
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:42.760]   deal shopping and unit prices, et cetera, you can accomplish a world of parenting good
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.800]   that is not possible in other ways.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:51.240]   Whether that's showing the relevance of mathematics, giving them fun prices, fun things to do,
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.640]   or just showing them how to save money and how to – the value of a dollar, those are
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.920]   lessons that they will take with them.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.760]   Your children – I can point to example after example after example.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:08.400]   Your children can emerge from your household as careful, diligent stewards of the resources
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:15.080]   that they have with tens of thousands and in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.880]   under their stewardship that they've earned, saved and invested.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:26.520]   Or they can turn out like the kind of children who just walk into a local convenience store,
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.600]   pop a bag of chips on the counter and swipe their credit card.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.240]   It's your job as a parent to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.280]   That's it for today's show.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.920]   I hope this content has been useful for you.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.960]   A little philosophical there at the end.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960]   I hope you like my stories.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:48.080]   It's always – man, those of you who are parents will know you share parenting stuff
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.560]   in public, you risk the wrath of the internet coming down upon you.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   But I share them.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.560]   For those of you who will enjoy the stories, just what they are, just fun parenting stories
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   as related to money.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.560]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.880]   I appreciate your being here.

[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:15.720]   I've suppressed a lot of the ads out here recently and that's for a few reasons but
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.480]   ads will come back in the future I think but for right now I've been working on some
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.800]   other things just trying to finish up some products to sell to you and some really good
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.280]   stuff has been the hardest thing I've done in my business thus far and I've failed
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   miserably.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.080]   But I've also had some success.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.960]   I'm still working hard at that and failure is a good chance to keep on pressing forward.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   That's what I'm doing.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:39.320]   But in the meantime, I would be grateful to you if you gain value from this, if you'd
