[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.480]   Marilynne Robinson has written a novel titled Gilead, a beautiful novel of hers
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.600]   that you readily recommend, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.440]   And at one place in the novel, this is what she writes, quote,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.920]   in eternity, this world will be Troy, I believe.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.840]   And all that has passed here will be the epic of the universe,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.000]   the ballad they sing in the streets.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.480]   Because I don't imagine any reality putting this one in the shade entirely, and
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.080]   I think piety forbids me to try, end quote.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.040]   What do you think, Pastor John?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240]   Will this life be a ballad of eternity?
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.720]   Obviously, there will be no tears and no regrets in heaven, but
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.320]   are there any biblical clues on the place of history in eternity?
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.560]   >> I would love to know what she means by piety forbids me to try.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.480]   I know what I mean when I say yes to your question, because I agree with her.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.680]   At least insofar as I understand her, I agree with her.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280]   When Troy is mentioned, not everybody might get that.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.600]   Troy was the city that the Greek states were attacking to try to capture,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.280]   and it was a ten year conquest, and Homer wrote the Iliad about it.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.680]   And the Iliad, I think,
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.200]   focuses pretty much on the last several weeks of that conquest.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.680]   And Troy is captured, and so the bravery is heralded for generations to come.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.640]   And the Odyssey is about the coming home of Odysseus.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.320]   And so in other words, a great historical exploit that is told and
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.880]   written in poems for generations to come.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.280]   And she's saying, in the age to come, after Christ returns and
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.480]   the kingdom is established and the new heavens and the new earth are in place,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.920]   the last thousands of years of church history that we are living in right now
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760]   are going to be that balladry.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760]   They're going to be that, and I think that's right.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.280]   So here's my reason.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.200]   What is history for?
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.280]   What is history for?
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.480]   All your, this is Psalm 145, all your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.800]   All your saints shall bless you.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.120]   They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom and tell of your power
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.520]   to make known to the children of man your mighty deeds and
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.600]   the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.720]   And I want to say, what?
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.840]   They're just going to stop?
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.640]   [LAUGH]
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880]   All of that is magnificently worth heralding now, and
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.240]   it won't be magnificently worth heralding then?
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   I don't think so.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   What does Christ's work mean?
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.680]   When I read in Revelation 5 that they are singing,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.600]   in heaven worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   For you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.240]   God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.480]   They're singing that ages after the event in heaven,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.600]   they're singing about the cross.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.560]   Now, what meaning could the cross possibly have in heaven
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.480]   if the history of redemption is forgotten?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.440]   Nothing, it will be meaningless.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.760]   In other words, if you say, what will be celebrated about Jesus Christ?
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.840]   Surely, he will be celebrated for
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.680]   having fulfilled all the promises of the Old Testament.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.160]   Surely, he will be celebrated in ways we've never seen
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.920]   by fulfilling everything the history of redemption was all about.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.120]   Surely, he will be celebrated by being the ground and
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.160]   cause of every good thing that happened after him in the world.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.120]   And so if Christ really is the center, the apex of redemptive history for
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.360]   that apex to have its meaning, then the rest of history of which it
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.920]   is the apex has to be known and understood and celebrated as well.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.120]   And here's another pointer.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.160]   Revelation 15, 3, they sing in heaven, they sing the song of Moses,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.680]   the servant of God and of the Lamb.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.560]   Now, the song of Moses is Exodus 15,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.400]   where they're singing about the triumphs of the people of God over Pharaoh.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.720]   So if we're singing about the Lamb and we're singing the song of Moses,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.080]   surely that is symptomatic of singing the songs of the triumphs of God
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   in world history right down to the salvation of Tony Ranke, surely, right?
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.720]   Why would your story not be told and not be remembered to the praise and
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.560]   the glory of God?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   You're a trophy of grace.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.720]   Well, I think those trophies are gonna be walking around in the kingdom.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.280]   And if you see a trophy on somebody's shelf, you say, what's that?
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.040]   And he tells you about the game, right, the game.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.160]   And the season when the trophy was won.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   Or here's another clue.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.960]   We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, Paul says,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.480]   so that each one may receive his due from the body, what is good and what is evil.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.120]   Well, if you're gonna receive something for what was good,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.760]   though the good is gonna be remembered and something is gonna happen to you
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.680]   that will constantly call to mind the good.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.240]   So there's another evidence or the ten talents, you're gonna be serving over ten
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.400]   cities, I'll be serving over five cities, and there will be some explanation for
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.440]   that, and the explanation is it has roots back in this age.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.720]   Now, I think you asked also, well, wait a minute,
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.880]   there's a lot of sad stuff in this age, and he's gonna wipe away every tear.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.960]   Okay, here's my take, and you can say this is speculative maybe,
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.880]   but I don't think Jesus is going to wipe away tears of joy.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.640]   When he says every tear will be wiped away, he means painful tear,
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.720]   tear that is destructive and hurtful and paralyzing,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.240]   and it makes my life miserable to have these tears and these memories.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   But if my, I mean, I'm sure most of our listeners will agree that
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.840]   the deepest joys have sometimes brought tears rather than laughter.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.800]   Tears of stunned amazement that we've been treated so well,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.120]   and those tears aren't gonna be wiped away, they're beautiful.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.600]   You can see the sparkle of grace in those tears.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.280]   And if you would ask me, well, will there be regrets?
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:52.000]   Hmm, for years I have tried to put together two texts that I think gives an answer to this.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.120]   One is Philippians 3 where it says, forgetting what lies behind,
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.800]   we strain forward to the goal, so you're supposed to forget what lies behind.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.640]   And the other is Ephesians 2 that says, remember that you were once separated from Christ.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   So you got a command to forget and a command to remember.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.080]   How do you put those together?
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.960]   I put them together like this.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:24.360]   Every regret and every memory will be done away with that cannot serve your greater joy,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.760]   cannot serve your greater love for Jesus, your greater valuing of grace.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.440]   So he will wipe away every way of remembering,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.760]   every way of regretting that ruins your joy in heaven,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.240]   and minimizes his mercy and minimizes his glory.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:57.480]   But I think, Tony, that Marilynne Robinson is right that we have a great Troy in redemptive history,
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   and God will see to it that all the mighty works of grace done in the thousands of years leading up to the second coming
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.320]   will not be forgotten.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:14.520]   And yes, she's probably right that piety should prevent us from wanting it to be forgotten.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.400]   Excellent. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
