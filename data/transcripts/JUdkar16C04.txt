[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.720]   that portion of scripture we read at the beginning, namely in the Gospel according to St Luke
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.480]   in chapter 17, reading again verses 20 and 21.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.280]   And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.600]   them and said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, neither shall they say
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.280]   lo here or lo there.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.720]   For behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.920]   Now there are those who would translate that last statement like this, "For behold, the
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.920]   kingdom of God is among you."
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.120]   We can't say finally which of the two is right.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.680]   It's wise, I believe, to accept both of them, "The kingdom of God is within you, the kingdom
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.640]   of God is among you."
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.400]   Now I'm calling your attention once more to the bare elements and essentials of the Christian
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   faith.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.200]   I say I'm doing this once more because I've already been doing it for two Sunday nights.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.840]   And I'm doing it as I've been explaining it because of the terrible and appalling confusion
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.680]   at the present moment with regard to this very question, as to what the Christian faith
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   really is.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480]   Now I say that this is a tragic confusion for this reason.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.760]   The world is in terrible trouble.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.520]   All the ideas of men have been tried and have been found wanting.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.920]   They've been given an opportunity but they've not yielded any results.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.360]   And men and women at long last are beginning to ask, "Is there any hope?
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   Can anything be done?"
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.760]   And it's at that point the Christian church appears and she stands before the world and
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.040]   she says, "Listen to what we've got to say.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.560]   Here is the message."
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.320]   And I believe that in many senses the world is more ready to listen than it has been for
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.880]   many a long year.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.420]   But unfortunately, when it does turn to listen, it hears a confused sound.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.120]   And as the Apostle Paul puts it in writing to the Corinthians in the first epistle in
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.600]   chapter 14, "If the trumpet yield an uncertain sound, who shall prepare him for the battle?"
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.720]   If the sound is uncertain, well then, we are going to add to the confusion.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   And that is why I say that nothing is more important at the present hour than that we
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.240]   should be perfectly clear in our minds as to what this Christian message really is.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.840]   What does Christianity offer to people?
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   What is it?
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.200]   How can we become Christian?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.160]   Those are the questions which it seems to me we've got to answer at this present time.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   Now what makes this terrible confusion so utterly inexcusable, of course, is that we've
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.960]   got an open Bible before us.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   And we have it in a language that we can understand.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   It's in English.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.480]   Here it is, translated into so many other languages.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.280]   If we hadn't a Bible at all, if we had merely some oral tradition, well, there would be
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.360]   some excuse for this terrible prevailing confusion.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.520]   Or if we'd got a Bible but we couldn't understand the language in which it was written,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.680]   again, there would be considerable excuse.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.880]   But that's not our position at all.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   We've got it.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.200]   It's open before us.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.560]   There's no difficulty in obtaining it.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.680]   But it is in a language, it's been translated into a language that we can all understand.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.200]   Well then why is there any confusion?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.120]   And there's only one answer to that question.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.600]   It is because men and women, instead of taking the message as it is here, are imposing their
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   own message upon it.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.560]   They're approaching Christianity as if we hadn't an open book.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.240]   They're approaching it with their minds, with their philosophies, with their theories,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.640]   with their ideas, and their attempts to understand.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.720]   And they're bypassing what is here stated in this book that is open before us, I say,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.520]   in a language that we can all understand.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.000]   So my plea is just this, that in honesty, apart from anything else, we are bound to
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.400]   come back to this book.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.040]   Here are the documents of the early church.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.520]   Here are the records of how Christianity came into being, how Christianity began, what she
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.360]   taught at the beginning, and something of what happened as the result of it.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.240]   Here it is.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.800]   And I suggest to you that the time has arrived when we must come back to it and listen to
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   what it has got to say.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.200]   Whatever we may make of it, we must attenuate, listen to it.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.880]   And we must say that is clearly the message of the New Testament itself.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.560]   And in particular, we must come back to the words and to the teaching and to the message
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.840]   of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.520]   Now that's what we've been doing.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.120]   And as a result of turning back, we've seen already certain things.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   And here they are.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.400]   Let me summarize them.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.080]   It's a clear message.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.720]   We are told that when John was cast into prison, Jesus came preaching, proclaiming, making
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.280]   an announcement, like a man blowing a trumpet, a kind of town crier, making a proclamation,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.040]   not putting forward rival theories, but telling them something.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   And what did he tell them?
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.760]   Well, what he said was this.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.840]   He said, "The time is fulfilled."
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   What time?
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.560]   The time that God had indicated many centuries before to the children of Israel and even
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.520]   before that, the time when he was going to send a deliverer, a Messiah, into this world.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.360]   He says, "It's come.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.480]   The kingdom of God is drawn near."
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.920]   And he says that he is that king of that kingdom, and that it is with his coming that the kingdom
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.000]   of God is drawn near unto men and women in this world.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.960]   And then he goes on, as we saw, to urge men and women to seek this above everything else.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.760]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness," he says, "and all these
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.880]   other things shall be added unto you."
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.360]   He says, "The trouble with life and with men and women is that their whole idea is
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   wrong.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.280]   The trouble is not that we are wrong here and there.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.920]   Our fundamental outlook is wrong.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.680]   We are putting the wrong thing first.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   We are putting clothing first, food and drink.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.960]   We are putting money first."
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.320]   "No, no," he says, "you need a radical reorientation of your whole outlook.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.160]   You need a change at the centre of your lives.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.280]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.520]   That's the thing that you need above everything else."
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.180]   The world, he says, is looking in the wrong directions for happiness and peace and joy
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.240]   and for the solution to its problems.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.680]   He says, "This is the thing to look for, and you must go for it with the whole of your
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   being.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.160]   You must make a fresh start.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.280]   You must make a new beginning."
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.760]   The only hope, he says, is to be in the kingdom of God.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.960]   Very well.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.560]   The question we now have to face, therefore, is this.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.040]   What is this kingdom of God that he talks about?
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.520]   You must have noticed as you read your four Gospels, the great prominence that is given
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.440]   to this theme, the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.240]   Our Lord was always preaching about it.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.800]   He puts it in different ways, but that was his major theme.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.200]   So we don't have any hope of understanding his message unless we have some clear idea
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.280]   as to what he means when he talks about this kingdom of God.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.360]   "You seek that first," he says, "you get into that.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.440]   All these other things shall be added unto you."
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.240]   And we saw something of how he does that.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.560]   But what is this kingdom?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:31.400]   Well, now, then, here again I am constrained to say that there is no excuse for the confusion.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.440]   There is tremendous confusion as to what this kingdom of God is.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.480]   And it's because these verses that I have read to you deal specifically with that particular
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.760]   question that I am calling your attention to them tonight.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.920]   This it seems to me is the next step in our approach to this essential message of the
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.400]   Christian faith.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.480]   So I would divide up the matter like this.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.240]   How does the Lord Jesus Christ set up his kingdom?
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.520]   Or if you prefer it, how does the kingdom of God come?
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:15.880]   Now, you see, he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.080]   That was the question they kept on putting to him.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:26.720]   And his reply is, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, neither shall they say
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.600]   lo here or lo there.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   For behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.680]   Now, then, here is our first point.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:46.240]   The way in which this kingdom of God comes is something that has been misunderstood from
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   the very beginning.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.480]   Now, here is the case in point, you see.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.160]   The Pharisees asked him, "You see, you're always talking about a kingdom.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.960]   You say that your coming means that the kingdom of God is drawn near.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.680]   What is this kingdom of God of yours?
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680]   When is it going to come?"
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.040]   "Isn't it about time," they said, "that you told us now how it's going to come and when
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   it's going to come?"
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   And our Lord immediately corrects them.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.800]   And he corrects them, of course, because he discerns immediately that their whole notion
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.000]   of the coming of the kingdom is entirely wrong.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.440]   And as you go through the Gospels, I say you will see this happening repeatedly.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.360]   There's another illustration of exactly this same thing in the sixth chapter of John's
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.160]   Gospel in verse 30.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.600]   "Here they come to him, the same people, and they said therefore unto him, 'What sign
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.640]   showest thou then that we may see and believe thee?
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   What is thy work?'"
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.360]   They say, "You keep on talking about this kingdom."
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.840]   Now, they said, "We want some sign from you.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.640]   Moses gave our fathers.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.000]   Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, and it is written he gave them bread from heaven
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.240]   to eat.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.600]   What are you doing?" they say.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.800]   Moses was God's leader.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.600]   He was the lawgiver, and he gave a sign by giving them manna.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.240]   What sign are you giving?
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.680]   What evidence are you going to give us?"
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.640]   They said, "That you really are this king that you're talking about, and that you are
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.520]   going to bring in a kingdom."
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:19.960]   Now the Pharisees and Stribes were constantly arguing and debating with him over that very
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   point.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.760]   Haven't you been struck as you've read your four Gospels?
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.720]   As to how much of their time is taken up, and particularly the Gospel according to St.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:36.560]   John, in mere arguments and disputations and wranglings between our Lord and these Pharisees
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.520]   and Scribes and doctors of the law.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.520]   What was it about?
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.840]   Well, it was all due to the fact that they were completely and entirely wrong in their
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.760]   notions and ideas about the coming of this kingdom.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.920]   They'd listen to him, and then they'd ply him with their questions.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.960]   They'd say, "When's it coming then?
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960]   You've been talking about it.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.680]   When's it going to come, men?
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   We want some tangible evidence.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.480]   We want some real sign.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.560]   We are practical men.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.520]   We are tired of this mere preaching.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.080]   When are you going to show us your kingdom?"
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.800]   Now this is true not only of the Pharisees and the Scribes.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.400]   It was equally true of the Roman governor, the governor Pilate.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:21.800]   Let me read to you from the 18th chapter of John's Gospel, and this is what I read.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.200]   "Here is our Lord standing before Pilate in the judgment hall.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.560]   Pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called Jesus and said unto him, 'Art
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.200]   thou the king of the Jews?'
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.000]   Jesus answered him, 'Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   me?'
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.120]   Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew?
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.840]   Thy known nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.120]   What hast thou done?'
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:53.080]   Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.560]   If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.880]   to the Jews.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.000]   But now is my kingdom not from hence.'
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.200]   Pilate therefore said unto him, 'Art thou a king?'
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.160]   Then Jesus answered, 'Thou sayest that I am the king.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.000]   To this end I was born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.080]   witness unto the truth.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.600]   Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.'"
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.520]   Pilate, you see, again was in trouble.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.400]   He says, "They say you are a king, and you say that you are a king.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   What's your kingdom then?
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.000]   Where's your kingdom?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.840]   I am representing an earthly kingdom.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.040]   I am the emissary of the emperor of Rome.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.600]   I understand a thing like that, but where's your kingdom if you say that you are a king?"
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.720]   And his answer is, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.880]   My kingdom cometh not with observation.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.080]   My kingdom is not of this world."
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.680]   But you see, it's the answer to the same sort of misunderstanding.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.520]   Indeed still more remarkable, we are told that his own brothers didn't understand it.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   In the seventh chapter of John's Gospel I read this, "The time of the feast of Tabernacles
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.960]   hath arrived.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.000]   His brethren therefore said unto him, 'Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.760]   also may see the works that thou doest.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.400]   For there is no man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   openly.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:22.320]   If thou do these things, show thyself unto the world.'
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.240]   For neither did his brethren believe in him," says John.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.200]   Our Lord answers his own brothers, and he says, "My time is not yet come, but your time
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.600]   is always ready.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.120]   The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it that the works thereof
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.800]   are evil."
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.880]   Now that's the most significant thing.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.080]   His own brethren, his own brothers, born of the same mother, they were jeering at him
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.880]   and mocking him and saying, "Now you're claiming so much for yourself.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.520]   If you are what you say you are, well go up to Jerusalem, go up to the feast.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   People will have come there from everywhere.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.400]   Stand up before them and make a proclamation.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   Show yourself.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.000]   What's this you're doing?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.520]   You're claiming a lot, but you're spending your time here amongst a handful of poor people.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.520]   What is this?
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.520]   Why don't you do something about it?"
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.800]   They were expecting the kingdom of God to come with some sort of observation.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:21.240]   Indeed, still more remarkable and most remarkable of all was the way the very disciples and
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.000]   apostles themselves stumbled over this very thing.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.240]   We've got illustrations of it in the Gospels.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.400]   I won't worry with them, but let me give you an illustration of how they still stumbled
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.160]   even after his resurrection.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.480]   It's in the first chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.120]   Being assembled together with them, our Lord commended them that they should not depart
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.920]   from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he, "Ye have heard
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   of me."
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.640]   For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.240]   many days hence.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.760]   When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, "Lord, wilt thou at
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.600]   this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.800]   Now, this is after the resurrection.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.560]   These men had seen the crucifixion.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   They had seen him dead.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   They had seen him buried.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.280]   They had seen that he's risen.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   They know that he's the risen Lord.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.240]   Still they hold on to this notion.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:27.120]   "Wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.280]   He said unto them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.120]   hath put into his own power.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.440]   But there it is, even his own chosen apostles, they're in trouble about this."
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.240]   They said, "Now then, having conquered death and the grave surely, and having risen from
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.920]   the dead, he's now surely going to bring in his kingdom."
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.200]   He talked a lot about it.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.920]   So they even ventured to ask him, "Is this the moment when you're going to do it?"
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:58.080]   You see, the misunderstanding concerning the kingdom was universal.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.800]   Now I've taken you through all that evidence because it seems to me to be most important.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.640]   You see, there's a common fallacy in them all.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.600]   And the fallacy is that the kingdom of God is something that comes visibly, that it comes
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.920]   externally, that it comes as the result of some momentous action.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.440]   It wasn't there, it is there.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.240]   They were all expecting it to come in a similar way and manner, by observation.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.720]   Their whole notions concerning it were in the realm of the visible.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   What was their idea?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.320]   Well, it was the same idea they all had it.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.880]   Their idea was this, that the Messiah of God, when he came, the great Deliverer, when he
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:43.800]   arrived, would be first and foremost a military and a political personage.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:49.080]   You see, they'd been conquered by the Roman Empire, and they were disgruntled and they
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.960]   were unhappy and they wanted to be set at liberty.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.600]   They were patriotic Jews, they'd had a great past, and they wanted that great past restored.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.200]   They'd become unimportant.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.240]   They wanted to be the chief nation in the world.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.920]   And their idea of the Messiah, the Saviour, when he came was that he'd come and gather
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   a great army.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.320]   He'd lead them against the enemy, he'd rout the enemy.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.440]   Israel would be the greatest nation in the world.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.680]   Jerusalem would be the capital city of the universe, and he would be the king who should
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   reign over them.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.740]   That was their notion.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.640]   So they were expecting him to set up a kingdom.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.480]   And that is why we read that extraordinary thing in the sixth chapter of John's Gospel
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.720]   in verse 15.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.360]   Our Lord had just worked that tremendous miracle of feeding the five thousand, and they were
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   all deeply impressed.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:42.920]   Then these men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, "This is of a truth,
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.040]   that prophet that should come into the world."
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.560]   Then listen, here's the next verse.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:56.200]   When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.880]   he departed himself again into a mountain alone.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.880]   He understood their minds.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.440]   He heard them murmuring to one another.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.160]   They said, "This man must be the prophet.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.000]   We've never seen a miracle like this before.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.120]   This is this unusual person that we were expecting.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.400]   This is the prophet."
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.200]   So they said, "Well now, then, let's take hold of him.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.380]   We must get him from here.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.640]   He should be in Jerusalem.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.000]   He should be set up as a king.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Let's take hold of him."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.440]   And they were about to take him by force to make him a king in Jerusalem.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.120]   He saw it.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.440]   He intercepted.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.560]   Then he went up into a mountain again himself alone.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.640]   Now there, you see, was the common fallacy with regard to this kingdom of God.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.800]   And unfortunately, it's a fallacy that has persisted.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.880]   I want to be very plain and simple.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.380]   We are living, my friends, in a terrible age.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.380]   It's an age of bombs.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.080]   It may be the last age of the world.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.880]   There are many signs and indications of that.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.320]   And our eternal destiny depends upon our belief or disbelief of this gospel.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.880]   I therefore do not apologize for speaking very plainly.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.960]   This misunderstanding about this kingdom has persisted.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.000]   The Roman Catholic Church has helped to persist the wrong idea.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   When she states that she is the kingdom, and she's political as well as spiritual, and
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.440]   the Pope is a political personage, and you send ambassadors to his court, and he has
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   his ambassadors.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.680]   There it is, this union of church and state.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.400]   You've got it in Rome.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.800]   And all her persecution came out of that, the way she persecuted people.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.120]   Let me be quite honest.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.840]   Even Protestantism has fallen at times into the same error.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.200]   And there have been periods and eras in the history of the world when men have tried to
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.920]   make others Christian at the point of the sword.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.040]   When armies have gathered together to try to compel people to become Christian at the
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.240]   very point of the sword and face to face with death.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.960]   It's all this misunderstanding about the kingdom.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:58.160]   And unfortunately the misunderstanding has persisted even down until tonight.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.960]   One of the commonest ideas about the kingdom of God in this present century has been this,
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   that the kingdom of God comes by reforming the world, by changing the world.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:18.080]   And that as the world is reformed and as it's changed, so the kingdom of God comes.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.280]   I'm old enough to remember the first 13 years of this present century.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.240]   I remember some of them.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.000]   And I remember the great age of the so-called social gospel.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   That was what they believed.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.760]   They said, "You know, it used to be said that you brought in the kingdom of God by
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   preaching.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.280]   But now, the Liberal Party is going to bring it in by passing Acts of Parliament.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.240]   And it was believed that that Liberal government of 1906 onwards was really legislating into
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.600]   being the kingdom of God.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   This is it.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.320]   You relieve the poor, you build hospitals, you build better houses, you bring in your
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:56.240]   welfare state, you bring in your affluent society, you do away with children working
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.440]   in mines and so on.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.880]   The world is so much better.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   You've brought in the kingdom of God."
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.840]   There are still many who believe that.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.360]   I shouldn't be surprised but that at just this moment, a program on one of the channels
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.800]   of the television has just been carrying some such message.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.480]   Others have put it in this form, that the business of bringing in the kingdom of God
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.640]   is to make your protest, organize your movements, marches, campaigns, and protest against injustices,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.520]   against bombs and war, and in so doing, and by agitating on social political matters,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.520]   you are bringing in the kingdom of God.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   That's their idea of it.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.640]   Jesus, a political social teacher.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.680]   Now, this has been the tragedy of the centuries.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.880]   People complain of the empty chapels and churches today.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   Why are they empty?
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.560]   I think one of the main reasons is this, that before that first world war, it used to be
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:00.680]   said that the Tory party was nothing but the Church of England at prayer, and the Liberal
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.520]   and the non-conformity was nothing but the Liberal party at prayer.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.640]   And there was a great deal of truth in it.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.520]   And so the kingdom of God became lost between these two rival parties.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.920]   The whole thing had been materialized.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.680]   And so men and women began to say, "We don't any longer need our churches.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.160]   We don't need our Bibles.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   The thing's been done.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.040]   It's there happening before our eyes.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.320]   The kingdom of God has come in a visible manner.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.240]   We've brought it in by legislation.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.440]   What more is there?"
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.240]   And that is why I believe the masses are uninterested at the present time.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.080]   Well, now, that's the fallacy with which our Lord deals.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.960]   "That's wrong," he says.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.000]   "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.520]   Well then, how does it come?
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.520]   Well, now, I want to deal with this in a second point.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.080]   What are the forms of the kingdom of God?
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.240]   That's the question that emerges from what I've been saying, isn't it?
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.960]   If it doesn't come like that, how does it come?
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.040]   Well, there are three main answers to that question.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.440]   And they're all put before us in the Gospels, in the New Testament teaching.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:17.800]   The kingdom of God comes and came with the very presence and power manifested by the
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.320]   Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:25.240]   Now, there's a very wonderful illustration of that in the eleventh chapter of the Gospel
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.840]   according to St. Luke.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.200]   I must read this to you because it's so vital, my friends, that we should be clear
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   about this kingdom.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.120]   I read that he was casting out a devil and it was dumb.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.600]   And it came to pass when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake and the people wondered.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   But some of them said, "He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils."
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.320]   And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.720]   But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, "Every kingdom divided against itself
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.480]   is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falleth.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.600]   If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.840]   Because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:16.040]   And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.560]   Therefore shall they be your judges.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:30.680]   If I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   Now that's it.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   That's what I mean.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:40.240]   The kingdom of God came when the Son of God was in this world.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   What is the kingdom of God?
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.360]   Well, it's a manifestation of the power of God.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   It's a manifestation of God's reign.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.400]   It's a manifestation of the fact that God is superior to the elements of nature, that
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.640]   he's superior to the devils and everything that's evil.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.000]   The kingdom of God is God's reign.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   It's God reigning.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.960]   And when Christ was here on earth, and when he worked his miracles and manifested his
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.880]   marvelous powers, he says, "This is the kingdom of God."
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.920]   Not legislation, not an army conquering another army, but the manifestation of the power of
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   God.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.000]   And do you notice what he did?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.880]   He could calm a storm at sea.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:28.540]   He could heal the blind, heal the lame, heal the deaf.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.600]   He could even raise the dead.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.480]   He was a master of creation.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.240]   He was a master of all the devils.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.080]   And he says that is proof positive that the kingdom of God has come.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.600]   Now he gave this same answer in a very dramatic manner, you remember, even to poor John the
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   Baptist.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.080]   Even John the Baptist went wrong about this.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.760]   You get that in the eleventh chapter of Matthew's Gospel.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.640]   It came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commending his twelve disciples, he departed
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.600]   thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.720]   Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:18.600]   and said unto him, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   You see John's trouble.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:25.520]   He had heard that our Lord was preaching up in Galilee to some poor people.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.760]   He wasn't down in Jerusalem setting himself up as a king.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.840]   He was there in that distant part of the country and working these works.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:38.720]   And there he was surrounded by poor people and John in the prison in pain and in agony
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.040]   sends his two messengers and says, "Look here, I thought you were the Messiah.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.840]   I said to my disciples, 'Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.'
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.080]   Do you know I'm beginning to wonder whether I was right.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.880]   Are you really the Messiah?
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.240]   Art thou he that should come?
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.960]   Or are we to wait for somebody else?
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.240]   Are we to look for another?"
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and show John again the things which ye do hear
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.840]   and see.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.160]   The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:16.280]   dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them."
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   What does he mean?
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   He means this.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.160]   He says, "Go back and tell John what you've seen and ask him a question.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.720]   Can't you see men, that there are the signs of the coming of the kingdom?
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.680]   Can't you see the power of God is here?
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.440]   No one has ever done things like this before.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.240]   The very miracles worked by our Lord, the manifestations of his almighty power, are
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.320]   an indication of the fact that the kingdom of God has come in his presence and in his
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   power."
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.960]   Now then, he says to these Pharisees who ask him, "When is it going to come?"
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.060]   He says, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.060]   You are waiting and looking.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.060]   Can't you see it's among you?
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.920]   Can't you see it's happening in your midst?
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.400]   Haven't you felt something of the power yourselves?
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   It's among you.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   It's here.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.840]   It's in me and my mighty power which my Father has given me through the Spirit."
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.960]   That's his answer.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.240]   It's already come in that way.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:14.320]   But then it comes in another way, the second way, and that is, of course, in the church.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.120]   The kingdom of God being the realm in which God reigns and rules, the kingdom of God is
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:26.000]   present where men and women have subjected themselves to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   the Son of God.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   That is the church.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.680]   And the church is a manifestation of the kingdom of God.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.440]   But let me be perfectly plain and clear about this.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.680]   When I say the church, I'm not thinking of an external organization.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.280]   That comes into it, but it isn't only that.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.960]   I say once more that that system known as Roman Catholicism is not the church.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.320]   That's not the kingdom of God.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.920]   That's an earthly state and kingdom with pomp and power.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   And the kingdom of God doesn't yet come with pomp and power and show.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.960]   Neither is it any other state church.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.760]   Neither is the church merely men and women who are church members.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:17.160]   For alas, you can be a member of a church and not be a Christian.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.920]   There are many such, unfortunately.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.320]   There has been a time in the life of many of us when we were like that.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.800]   We were members of the church.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.120]   We had no idea as to what Christianity was.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.960]   I was received a member of the church at the age of fourteen.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   I hadn't the faintest idea as to what Christianity meant.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.200]   But I was received into the church.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.760]   I was allowed to take communion.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.680]   I had no notion as to its meaning.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.000]   I was in the church nevertheless.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.920]   I was a member of the church.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.080]   That's not what I mean.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.640]   I don't mean formal adherence to a society.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.720]   I don't mean my name on a church row.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.320]   I don't even mean activities within this society.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.600]   Well what do you mean, says someone?
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:05.360]   Do you mean this latest popular idea and stunt that what we need is a religionless Christianity?
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.400]   The teaching of this German Bonhoeffer?
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.720]   That you abolish your churches and cease to have religious rites and ceremonies and worship
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.800]   and you find the kingdom of God by going out into the world, mixing with people, and there
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.680]   as you mix with people in their needs and troubles you find the kingdom of God.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.480]   One of them goes further and says that if you really want to find the kingdom of God
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.040]   you don't go to churches, you go to the brothels in Algeria or somewhere like that and there
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.480]   you'll find it amongst the drink and the prostitution.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.880]   No, he's actually said that in the name of Christianity.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.720]   I don't mean that.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.280]   I don't mean a formal institutionalized church.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.080]   I don't mean a churchless, religionless Christianity.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   What do I mean?
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.640]   Well what I mean is this.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.480]   I mean a body of men and women who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.680]   I mean a body of men and women who believe in their hearts that he is the Son of God.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.280]   I mean a body of men and women who are living to his glory and who know him and who are
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   here to serve him.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   That's what I mean by the church.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.080]   He reigns in the hearts of his true believers.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.560]   He reigns in the hearts of those who are constrained by his love.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:20.880]   He reigns in those whose chief desire is to know him and to serve him and to be aware
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   of his power.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.280]   That's the church.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.920]   And it is one of the forms of the kingdom of God.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.840]   It is its main form at the present time.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.040]   When he was here in the flesh, there it was.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   He's here in his people.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.180]   The church is the body of Christ.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.920]   He acts through her, body of Christ, members in particular.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:47.360]   And according to this teaching, there is to be a third form of this kingdom, and that
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.280]   is one which is to come.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.680]   And it was that, of course, that he went on to speak about to these Pharisees who put
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.160]   this question to him that we are considering together in this seventeenth chapter of the
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.840]   gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.800]   "There's a day coming," he says.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.600]   "It's the day of the Son of Man."
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   And what he means is this, you see, there is a day coming when the kingdom of God will
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:21.880]   come in a visible manner, in an external manner, in a manner when all shall see it and none
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.560]   shall be able to evade it.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.600]   Not yet, it hasn't come.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.520]   This is the third form.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.800]   This is at the end of the church age.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.760]   This is at the time when Christ comes back again, when he really returns to earth in
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.720]   a visible bodily form, surrounded by the angels riding the clouds of heaven.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.320]   He's going to come like that.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   He said so himself.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.960]   "The Son of Man," he said, "is going to come riding on the clouds of heaven.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.520]   Every eye is going to see him, yea, they that pierced him also."
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.880]   The kingdom of God will come with great external pomp and glory.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.320]   He will come in the majesty of his eternal Godhead.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.160]   And he will come to rule, to reign, to judge, and to set up his everlasting kingdom.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.800]   Now, let me give you his own words in which he said this.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.480]   You will find them at the end of the nineteenth chapter of the gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.920]   Here they are.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.600]   Then answered Peter and said unto him, "Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.120]   What shall we have therefore?"
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:32.040]   And Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me in
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:39.120]   the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.400]   sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.560]   That's it.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.720]   The Son of Man is going to come and sit in the throne of his glory.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.600]   It's the regeneration, he says.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   What does that mean?
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.240]   Well, you see, it means this, and this is the great message about the visible form of
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.720]   the kingdom that is to come.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:06.000]   That when all the elect have been gathered in, the Son of God will return again, as I
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.200]   say, into this world.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.840]   He'll set up the judgment throne.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.240]   He will judge the whole world in righteousness.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.440]   All who don't believe in him will be consigned to everlasting punishment with the devil and
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.640]   all the evil angels, and they'll be banished out of his sight.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.200]   Then the whole world, the cosmos, shall be purged of all evil.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   Nature is now red in tooth and claw.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.360]   It won't be then.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.280]   The lion will lie down with the lamb and the wolf with the ox will eat straw together.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.200]   A little child shall lead them.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.720]   The child shall put his hand upon the hoe of the asps.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   This is the regeneration.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.720]   It's coming.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.800]   Sin and evil are going to be banished out of the cosmos.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.480]   There'll be a realm of glory and he'll sit upon his throne in the glory, and all
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   who believed in him will be with him.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.800]   They will reign with him forever and forever.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   That's coming.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.960]   This is his own teaching, as it is the teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:06.920]   Now then, there you see I've answered the second question.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.880]   Those are the three forms which the kingdom of God takes.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.800]   Two of them have already ceased.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.280]   The other is in operation.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.960]   The other is yet to come.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.520]   That brings me to my third and my last great principle, which is this.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.480]   Our relationship to this kingdom.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.800]   Now then, we know something about it, don't we?
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.140]   The kingdom is that realm in which he reigns, in which he masters all his enemies, in which
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.320]   he controls all evil and finally disposes of it.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.880]   And the one thing that matters to us, therefore, is to belong to that kingdom.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.680]   That's the thing we should all be concerned about.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.060]   And the question is, how can I enter this kingdom?
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.560]   How can I be sure that I belong to this kingdom so defined?
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.640]   And he answers us, "The kingdom of God," he says, "is within you.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.360]   The kingdom of God is among you."
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   What does this mean?
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.800]   Well, again, I must emphasize what it doesn't mean.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:22.280]   It doesn't mean, you see, that I just accept that part of his teaching which agrees with
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.420]   my ideas.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.240]   There are many people doing that.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.280]   There are people who come to services here, and they come to talk to me afterwards, and
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.640]   that is what they say to me, some of them.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.520]   You see, they've got certain ideas about world improvement and reform, and they read the
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.280]   Sermon on the Mount and they say, "Now, there are very good ideas there.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.880]   We must use these, as Mr. Gandhi used to do.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.280]   He'd pick out portions of Christ's teaching and he'd adopt them, though he remained a
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.680]   Hindu and he thought that was a way of bringing in the kingdom of God."
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.400]   That isn't it.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.480]   Neither does it mean that we accept out of his teaching that with which we agree.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.520]   You don't enter the kingdom of God like that.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.960]   There are many trying to do that.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.560]   They're looking out for the best teaching, they're looking out for the best ideas, they
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   want the world to be a better place, they want to be happier themselves.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.440]   They've read the philosophers, they've read the great religious geniuses, they've read
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.840]   about Confucianism and Buddhism and Hinduism, they've read about the cults, and they come
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.240]   to what they call the teaching of Jesus.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.160]   And they're going to take this and adapt it in order that they may know something about
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   this kingdom of God.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:30.360]   It can't be done like that.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.240]   Neither is it done by our trying to imitate him.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.600]   There are many who are trying to do that.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.000]   We are even being urged to do it by some of these modern representations of Christianity.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.840]   We are told that his great secret was his selflessness, that he didn't consider himself.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.240]   He became weak and allowed the world to edge him out, do anything they like to him.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.800]   They say if you do the same, you are in his kingdom, you are imitating him and you are
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.220]   like him, and that's the way you save yourselves.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:03.560]   The imitation of Christ, becoming selfless, making great acts of self-sacrifice, doing
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.960]   good in the world, trying to improve it, and trying to give a helping hand to people.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:14.000]   We are told that as we imitate him and try to repeat his life and his actions, so we
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.840]   introduce ourselves into the kingdom of God.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.920]   But he gives the lie direct to all such notions.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   No, no.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.720]   How do I enter this kingdom?
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:32.240]   Oh, he says the kingdom of God is within you.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.120]   What does he mean?
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.020]   How can the kingdom of God be in me?
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.840]   How can it be amongst us?
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.300]   Well, you see, it comes to this.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.580]   This is his teaching.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:51.520]   The kingdom of God is in me when I recognize who he is.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.100]   That's the first absolute essential step.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:03.180]   The kingdom of God is only in me when I suddenly realize who he is.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:07.620]   I may have admired him as a great man, I may have admired him as a great teacher, I may
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:12.540]   have admired him as the greatest political expert that the world has ever known, the
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.620]   one who had the greatest insight, the greatest social reformer.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.140]   I may have looked at him in all these ways and admired him and praised him.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.580]   The kingdom of God isn't in me.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:32.460]   The kingdom of God only enters into me when I realize that he is the Son of God incarnate.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:38.140]   When I listen to him saying the time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.780]   It's in hand in me.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.780]   Why?
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.140]   Well, because I've come from heaven, because I am son of God, because I'm the one who's
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.420]   come from the glory and has taken on me human nature.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.020]   My belief in him has God in the flesh come to redeem me.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.420]   There I see him and the kingdom of God has entered me.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:01.060]   But he doesn't stop there.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.860]   It means that I give a recognition to his demands of me.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:12.460]   It means that I say my Amen to the rightness of his teaching.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.060]   You see, that's what the Pharisees would never do.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.260]   That's why they were always arguing with him and giving him their trick-trap questions
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.420]   and disputing every point with them.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.420]   You see, the trouble was that he came and he began to expound the law to them.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.460]   They were the experts on the law.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.980]   They thought they knew all about it, but now he begins to expound the law.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:38.060]   He starts off by saying this, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:46.540]   of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.780]   Now there it is, flat, straight, absolute.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.740]   The Pharisees fast twice in the week.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.940]   They give a tenth of their goods to the poor.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.700]   Not good enough, says this man.
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.180]   Not good enough, not sufficient.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.380]   No, that's not enough.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.940]   It must exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.940]   What's he talking about?
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.260]   Well, he goes on to expound it.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.540]   He says, "Verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.380]   in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.940]   Therefore, whosoever shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.660]   men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:29.460]   But whoso shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.640]   And then he goes on to illustrate what he means.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.660]   He says, "You have heard it said, Thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill shall be
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.740]   in danger of the judgment.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.380]   But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.940]   in danger of judgment.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.980]   And whosoever shall say to his brother, Racker, shall be in danger of the council.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:54.500]   But whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire."
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.340]   That's his teaching about that.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.700]   Then he goes on, "Thou hast heard it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   adultery."
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.940]   "All right," says the Pharisee, "I've never committed adultery.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.940]   I'm all right."
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.940]   "Wait a minute," says Christ.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:14.740]   "I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.900]   with her already in his heart."
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.420]   And on he goes, he says, "If you are right I offend thee, plug it out and cast it from
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.420]   thee.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.860]   It is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.900]   body should be cast into hell.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.620]   And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.260]   It is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.580]   body should be cast into hell."
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.780]   Then he goes on with his teaching about divorce.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.140]   They just wrote a bill of divorce and all was well.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.900]   He says, "Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.460]   her to commit adultery."
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.260]   He then says, "Thou shalt not forswear thyself.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.540]   I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by heaven nor by earth, for it is God's throne,
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.340]   nor by earth, for it is his footstool.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.460]   Let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.540]   For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.540]   You have heard it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.900]   But I say unto you that he resists not evil.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.980]   But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   If any man will sue thee at the lawn, take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also."
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.740]   And on he goes.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:33.260]   Having the kingdom of God in your heart means this, my friend, that you accept the teaching,
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.340]   but you are not content with you a bit of morality, that unlike the Pharisees you say
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.260]   he is right.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.380]   He gives a spiritual view of the law.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:47.380]   He says that God is concerned as much about my heart as about my actions, about my motives
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.440]   as about my deeds, as about what I think in my heart as what I do actually with my hands
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.020]   or my feet.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:59.980]   God searcheth the heart and is not content with a mere casual inspection of my superficial
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.980]   actions.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.940]   It means that I accept his teaching, I cease to argue, I say that's right, God demands
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:11.780]   an absolute righteousness of me.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:19.300]   And then it means this, that I listen to and accept his definition of me.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.500]   This is the hardest thing of all.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.040]   What does he say about me?
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.300]   What he says about me is that I am lost.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:32.480]   son of man, he says, is come to seek and to save that which is lost. They that are whole
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.260]   but sinners, to repentance. These are the people who are in his kingdom, the people
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.400]   who recognize that they are lost, that they are sick, that they are sinners, that they
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.380]   are hopeless, that they are vile, that they are so bad that they cannot be improved, that
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:59.380]   they must be born again. Have you accepted that, my friend? This is how you enter into
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.140]   his kingdom? This is how the kingdom of God comes into you? The kingdom of God is among
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.180]   you? It's in you? And how does it come? It comes into you when you see this, when you
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:15.180]   say, "Yes, absolutely right." He says, "I came to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.780]   And you've got to say, "Yes, it's perfectly true, I'm lost. I've been trying to save myself
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.700]   and I can't. I've been taking my resolutions. I've been trying to be moral and good. I can't
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:32.300]   do it. I'm lost. I'm damned. I'm hopeless. I'm vile." He's right. The moment you say
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:39.300]   that, the kingdom of God has come in you because you've repented. And then the next step is,
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:46.500]   of course, that you submit to yourself utterly and absolutely to his way of salvation. You've
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.820]   got to accept his rule, you see, in every respect. You've got to accept his interpretation
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:57.020]   of the law. You've got to accept his diagnosis of yourself. And now, in your utter helplessness,
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   you've got to believe and accept and surrender to his way of saving. What is it? He tells
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:12.220]   you quite plainly, "The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:19.220]   to give his life a ransom for many." As mercy is lifted up to serpent in the wilderness,
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:24.660]   even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:31.220]   perish, but have everlasting life. You've got to believe it, that there is life for
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.900]   a look at the crucified one, that you can do nothing, that you can decide to be good
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.300]   for the rest of your life, it won't save you, that you can try to imitate him, it'll damn
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:46.300]   you all the more. You've got to come helpless, hopeless, lost, vile sinner, and cast yourself
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:51.580]   at his feet and look up into his face. In other words, you and I have got to do with
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:57.340]   him exactly as this man whom we read of before we came to the text tonight did. You remember
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:02.780]   those ten lepers that were healed? And we are told that one of them, when he saw that
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:09.780]   he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God and fell down on his face
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:17.020]   at his feet, giving him thanks. And that's what you and I have got to do. We've got
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:25.100]   to realize that he brings us into his kingdom by dying for us, by bearing our sins in his
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:31.700]   own body on the tree, by being made the Lamb of God for us, that he bears our punishment,
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:36.260]   and it's our only way of deliverance and salvation. You believe it, and you say, "Just
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:41.340]   as I am, without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bidst me come
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:48.340]   to thee, O Lamb of God, I come." In other words, it means that you make an absolute
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:55.340]   total surrender. You cast yourself entirely into his hands. You deny yourself. You take
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   up your cross, and you follow him. And if you do these things, the kingdom of God is
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:12.460]   in you. It's within you. You've entered the kingdom, and the kingdom has entered you.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.900]   Why? Well, because, you see, he's everything to you. You are nothing. He is everything.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:22.460]   Nobody else counts at all. You say, "Christ is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.980]   the End. He's the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star. He's the Fairest
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:33.980]   of Ten Thousand to my soul. Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find."
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:43.300]   You just give yourself to him and acknowledge him as the Son of God and your personal Saviour
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:49.580]   and your Lord. You say that you require nothing but him, and he is everything to you, and
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.540]   you're going to live to his glory. Your one desire is to know him, to be near him,
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:58.380]   and to follow him, in order that you may be in that glory with him when he comes at the
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:05.380]   end of time. That's it. It doesn't come with observation. It doesn't come by passing
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:13.300]   Acts of Parliament in St. Stephen's. It doesn't come by world reformation. No, no.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:17.220]   The world may be going worse and worse, but the kingdom of God comes into you, and it
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:22.320]   comes into you when you see that he's Son of God, and you humble yourself at his feet,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.860]   and you say, "My Lord and my God," and you give yourself utterly, absolutely to
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   him. And you enter the kingdom as you do so, and the kingdom comes into you, and he reigns
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:39.660]   in your heart. He's got the throne of your life. He's your master. He's your Lord,
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.660]   as well as your most blessed Saviour.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:50.660]   Well, my friends, there it is. What was your idea, I wonder, of the kingdom of God? What
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:57.660]   was your idea, I wonder, of the kingdom of God? Do you now see what the kingdom of God
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:05.680]   is? Are you in this kingdom of God? Is this kingdom of God in you? Are you looking, "Yellow,
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:13.480]   yellow there? What can we do? What can we do to bring it in?" Oh, as it comes silently
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.840]   into your heart tonight, as you've listened to him, as you've realized that he's Son
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.920]   of God made man, as you've heard his teaching, his condemnation, have you agreed? Have you
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.840]   given in? Have you accepted it? And have you seen him in the fullness of his divine Saviourhood?
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:35.440]   And have you given yourself over entirely and utterly unto him? Have you fallen at his
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:42.440]   feet and looked up into his face? And have you made the grand confession, "Thou art
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   mine and I am thine. I desire nothing but thee. Let nothing please nor pain me apart,
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:52:00.520]   O Lord, from thee"? Is he the Lord of your life? Is he reigning in your heart? If so,
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   the kingdom of God is within you, and you are in the kingdom, and you are destined for
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:23.440]   that glory indescribable, which is yet to come when he shall appear in the final regeneration
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:33.080]   and sit upon the seat of his glory, in the glory everlasting. Amen.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   Amen.
