[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.220]   We're back with guest Trip Lee.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.340]   Trip, in your new book Rise, you write this, quote,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.420]   "I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theorizing
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.800]   "doomsday prophet with canned food
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.420]   "stacked ceiling high in my basement.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.700]   "I assure you I only keep enough canned food
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.860]   "in the house for the week ahead of me.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.040]   "But we do need to think about what it means
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.300]   "to be faithful to Christ in a culture
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.560]   "where our presence is less and less appreciated."
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.400]   End quote.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.120]   Yes, we do need to think about this
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.660]   and we all wanna be liked and accepted,
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.060]   but faithfulness to Christ means we won't be liked
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.040]   by the world ultimately.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.140]   So how do we live in the world
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.600]   seeking to influence the world positively,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.920]   but without living for the approval of the world?
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.840]   How do you personally find balance in this?
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840]   Yeah, that is tricky.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.280]   And something I had to think a lot about
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.960]   even while writing this book Rise
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.400]   because I'm writing to a generation that's growing up
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.760]   with that really decrease in appreciation
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.160]   for serious Christians.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.000]   And I think scripture really gives us lots of ways
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.620]   to kind of think about this and navigate this
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.800]   because it's not like after Jesus and the apostles
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.640]   and the early church, everybody always loved Christians
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.320]   and was excited for them to be around.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.540]   And then just recently,
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.120]   people have started not to like them.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.200]   Peter writes to young Christians in 1 Peter,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.880]   he says, "Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.720]   so that when they speak against you as evil doers,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   they may see your good deeds
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.600]   and glorify God on the day of visitation."
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120]   You know, Peter's really clear,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.440]   hey, live such good lives among them
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.240]   that they'll see your good deeds and glorify God.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640]   He's saying, they are gonna speak against you
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   as evil doers, that will happen,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880]   but you should live such a good life.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.280]   Even when they try to do that,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.240]   they'll look into your life
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.900]   and they'll see so many good deeds
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.040]   that it's gonna lead to glory for God himself.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.080]   And I think that's what we're really seeking to do
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.120]   is to live these really faithful lives in public
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.080]   that show the goodness of God.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.800]   And so it's not as if while living in the world,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.280]   we just say, hey, we're gonna do what we do.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.120]   We don't care what anybody thinks about anything.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.960]   No, no, no.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.880]   We do absolutely care about the way we live our lives
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.740]   because it does say something very, very clearly
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.900]   about the God that we serve.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.280]   But when people still don't even like us,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.480]   even though we're trying to do
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   what Peter's calling us to here,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.200]   there are a few things I talk about in the book
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.120]   that I think we should do.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   And one of them is we should stop being so surprised.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.560]   We should stop getting shocked
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.160]   when people are annoyed that we're serious about Jesus,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.560]   because it's not like Jesus said,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.640]   hey, follow me, everyone will love you for.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.880]   Jesus says, others will hate you for my name's sake.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.020]   So we should stop being so surprised.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.320]   And we have to fall out of love with being cool
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.860]   and being liked by everybody.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.640]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.900]   it's not gonna be cool to really pursue Jesus
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.440]   with everything you have.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.480]   And so we have to be okay with the fact
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.320]   that we won't be the ones that the culture looks to
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.520]   as the coolest, or even in our day and age, the nicest.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.980]   They're gonna really speak against
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.360]   a lot of the things that we do.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.200]   But we also have to be compassionate and not combative,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.920]   because the temptation is gonna be,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.980]   they're fighting me, let me fight back.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.840]   Or we have some Christians who the only way
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.740]   they can think of to really fight for the glory of Jesus
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.160]   is to yell at people for everything they do
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   that they don't personally like
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.120]   or that they don't see in scripture.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.560]   And instead, we wanna be very compassionate.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   It doesn't mean we don't say hard things to people,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.080]   but we wanna do it in a very loving and gentle way.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.000]   So the gospel itself is already offensive enough.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.780]   We don't need to add offense to it
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.520]   by being jerks about everything.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.200]   We don't need to add offense to it
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.480]   by being very condemning and self-righteous.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   We don't need to add offense to it
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.640]   by being incapable of actually loving
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.440]   and being in relationship with people.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.280]   We really wanna show people the compassion of Jesus,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.560]   even as we say very hard things.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.440]   I've seen it, it's easy to say hard things to people
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.880]   when they can tell that you care about 'em and love 'em,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.480]   when they don't feel like your project.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.160]   And when there's a track record that you have with somebody
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.240]   of genuinely loving them and caring for them
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.160]   and taking interest in their life and serving them,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.400]   when you say a hard thing, it may still be hard,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.800]   but it fits into a different context.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.640]   They can't just say,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.720]   well, it's just 'cause this person is hateful.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.560]   They say, well, nah, it is something much deeper than that.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.000]   And we have to stand firm.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.960]   People are really gonna wanna kinda push us
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.820]   off what we stand on.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.280]   They are gonna try to evangelize us and proselytize
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   and push us off of faith in Jesus,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.480]   but we are gonna really have to stand firm.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.640]   And that's only gonna happen
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.360]   when we have a very deep faith in the gospel.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.080]   And we can't be afraid to tell people
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.320]   very clearly about Jesus.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.000]   We can't, with our desire for approval,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.480]   decide that the gospel's offensive,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.840]   therefore I won't share it.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.200]   That's the thing that makes us distinct.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.800]   That's the incredible message that we have for everybody.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.040]   And we wanna share it freely
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.580]   and pray that the Lord will give us grace.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.480]   It'll be hard, but I am very curious to see
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.380]   the way that it impacts our evangelism
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.520]   and the way that it impacts this next generation.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.480]   - Outstanding, thank you, Trip.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.740]   Jesus never said, "Follow me,
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.460]   "and people will love you for it."
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.580]   That's a brilliant line, very true.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.040]   Thank you, Trip Lee.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.840]   I was earlier quoting from the new book titled
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.020]   "Rise" from Trip Lee, and you can find it
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.660]   in the new album by the same title at amazon.com.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.980]   Well, what's the key to being insecure
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.420]   for the rest of your life?
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.500]   Trip Lee will explain how tomorrow.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.460]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.100]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.560]   (whooshing)
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.880]   (whooshing)
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
