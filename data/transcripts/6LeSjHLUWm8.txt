[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   Welcome back on this Friday.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.000]   On Wednesday, last time we met in APJ 1925,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.560]   we looked at the cloud of anxiety
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.000]   that can encroach into our lives,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.680]   a feeling you sometimes get,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.520]   but can't quite put your finger on,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.480]   one that makes you just feel tense and anxious
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.300]   that something is going to go bad today.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.660]   Christians can find themselves inside such a fog of anxiety.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.260]   In fact, some Christians struggle a lot with daily anxiety,
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.200]   but should we?
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.020]   Hasn't the Holy Spirit delivered us
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.580]   from anxiety altogether?
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.780]   As we saw on Wednesday, the Apostle Paul claims that,
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.460]   quote, "God gave us a spirit, not of fear,
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.540]   but of power and love and self-control," unquote.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.300]   That's 2 Timothy 1:7.
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.660]   So why would any spirit-indwelt Christian
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740]   still struggle with anxiousness?
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.340]   That's Eric's question, a listener to the podcast.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.180]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.540]   If God does not give us a spirit of fear,
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.860]   but of power and love and self-control,
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.820]   2 Timothy 1:7 again,
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.520]   then why am I, as a believer,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.540]   still struggling to overcome fear?
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.400]   Shouldn't the Spirit's presence in me
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.940]   be the end of all my fearing?
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.060]   - One of the reasons I'm eager to tackle this question
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.460]   is because even though it is specifically
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.060]   about fear or anxiety,
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.180]   the principle that it's wrestling with
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.180]   relates to almost every area of Christian ethics
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.220]   or Christian virtue or sanctification.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.220]   The principle, namely,
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020]   of being made decisively new in Christ
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.580]   because of God's legal act of justification by faith
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.580]   and because of God's transformative act in the new birth
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.300]   and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.300]   and yet, in our actual daily lives,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.660]   realizing that we are not yet completely new,
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.820]   not completely transformed.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.420]   That's the tension that we all live with.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.780]   That's the reality of Christian living.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.020]   And even though we have addressed this, Tony,
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.740]   many times in this podcast,
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.740]   it is so basic and so important for every area of life
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.660]   that it's hard to address it too often or too many times.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.940]   All of us, not just Eric,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.940]   deal with this both and in our Christian lives every day,
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.900]   both decisively new, that's who we are,
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.800]   we are decisively new creatures in Christ,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.580]   and not yet completely new.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.980]   That's the reality, and learning how to live that way
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.000]   is the key to the Christian life.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.780]   What I mean by decisive, I like that word,
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.500]   it's really helpful, here's what I mean by it.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.740]   What I mean by decisive is that
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.280]   God has done something for us, for Christians.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.460]   He's done something for us, and he's done something in us
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.320]   that will never be taken away, ever.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.460]   God has done it, it's decided.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.980]   The saving work, he starts, he completes, Philippians 1, 6.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.500]   That's what I mean by decisive.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.060]   And yet, some of that saving work in us,
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.060]   that newness, is not yet complete.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.140]   It is crucial that we understand
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.500]   what God has done for us in justification,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.060]   what he has done in us in the new birth,
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.820]   what he's doing in us now by the Spirit,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.580]   what he will finally do for us
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.540]   as our newness becomes complete at the resurrection.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.140]   That's really crucial,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.180]   and that's what the question is ultimately about.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.860]   And what I'm trying to show is that Eric's experience
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.240]   of both, both of those,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.260]   having God's Spirit of fearlessness within him,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.980]   and fighting to overcome fear daily in his life
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.700]   by depending on the Spirit,
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.240]   that's what normal Christian life looks like.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.340]   So, let's get clear,
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.820]   'cause I think it's this basic structure of salvation
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.020]   that people, if they have a handle on this,
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.080]   I think they can sort out what their experience is.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.740]   So let's get clear that salvation,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.900]   which God gives us from guilt and sin and wrath
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.340]   and death and pain and hell,
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.820]   that full salvation into everlasting joy
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.820]   happens in stages, not all at once.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.300]   It has happened in some senses,
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.620]   it is happening in some senses,
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.660]   it will happen in the future in some senses,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.700]   and there are texts that say each of those.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.700]   Ephesians 2.8, "For by grace you have been saved
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.060]   through faith."
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.080]   This is not your own doing, it's the gift of God,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.940]   that's done, you have been saved.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.940]   1 Corinthians 1.18, "The word of the cross is folly
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.760]   to those who are perishing,
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.380]   Romans 13.11, "The hour has come for you to wake from sleep
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.900]   for salvation is nearer to us now,"
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.740]   like it's not here yet,
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.740]   but it's nearer than when we first believed.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.940]   Amazing.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.940]   You can fasten rich biblical words to God's work
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.740]   in each of those three stages of salvation.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.220]   It's done, it's happening,
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.380]   it's going to happen in the future.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.620]   You can fasten rich biblical words to those.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.460]   For example, what's already done?
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.420]   What's decisive?
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.460]   God's act of justification is already done.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.700]   It's past and complete.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.060]   There's no process to it
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.060]   because it's a legal declaration that happens all at once
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.500]   at the point of our conversion,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.260]   when we embrace Christ as our treasured Savior and Lord,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.540]   God declares us righteous in his sight.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.540]   Romans 5,1, "Having been justified by faith,
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.460]   we have peace with God."
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.260]   It's done, no process.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.860]   The court proceeding is over.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.700]   No double jeopardy.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.540]   You don't have to go back to court ever again on that issue.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.540]   Corresponding to this once for all legal act
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.940]   is the once for all transformative act
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.620]   called the new birth or regeneration.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.580]   That too has no process.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.380]   Unlike justification, it doesn't happen legally
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.380]   as in a courtroom, it happens inside us, but only once.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.660]   Babies are only born once.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.100]   1 Peter 1,23, "You have been born again,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.500]   not of perishable seed,
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.980]   but of imperishable through the living
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.180]   and abiding word of God."
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.220]   It's done only once.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.340]   Doesn't happen again.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.780]   It's not a process.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.700]   So justification, being counted righteous in Christ
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.660]   and regeneration, being born again,
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.660]   are acts of salvation that are totally complete.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.340]   Once for all, decisive, unchangeable.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.980]   God never reverses them.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.020]   Those whom he predestined, he called,
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.980]   and those whom he called, he justified,
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.900]   and those whom he justified, he glorified.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.620]   No failures, no dropouts, no reversals.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.620]   Justification and regeneration, once for all, decisive.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.620]   And the reason I stress it is because
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.940]   that's the ground we stand on.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.740]   When we're fighting to overcome anxiety,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.740]   that's where we're standing.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.500]   Then there's the saving act of God in process.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.660]   And the key word here is being sanctified.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.300]   Hebrews 10,14, "By a single offering,
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.220]   he has perfected for all time
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.100]   those who are being sanctified."
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.900]   So we are being saved by the present work
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.740]   of the Holy Spirit in our lives,
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.380]   helping us to put sin to death
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.500]   and walk in paths of righteousness.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.340]   And then finally, there's this future completion
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.020]   of salvation.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.020]   Peter says in 1 Peter 1,5, "By God's power,
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.020]   we are being guarded through faith
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.020]   for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.020]   So one aspect of that future salvation is rescue
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.940]   from the final wrath of God.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.420]   Romans 5,9, "Since therefore we have now been justified
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.420]   by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.660]   from the wrath of God."
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.020]   That's coming in the future.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:52.340]   Another aspect is our complete glorification.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.820]   Those whom he justified, he also glorified.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.940]   It's as good as done.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.900]   Complete and final bodily resurrection
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.340]   into sinless glory.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.980]   That's not here yet.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.820]   That's coming.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.620]   Now, what Eric's question draws our attention to
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:17.540]   is that between decisive justification and regeneration
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.220]   at the beginning of our Christian life
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.860]   and sinless glorification at the end of this age,
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.620]   this present life of being sanctified
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.100]   is not one of sinless perfection,
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.100]   but of warfare against sin in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.780]   God has his reasons.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.380]   This is one of the things I've wondered about all my life.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.340]   God has his reasons for why he does not perfect us
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.820]   instantaneously at the point of our conversion
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.300]   so that we never sin again.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.100]   He's gonna do that at the resurrection.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.860]   We'll never sin again.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.580]   Why doesn't he do it now?
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.540]   He doesn't do it in that way.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.780]   Why?
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.780]   He has chosen to save us by enabling us through the Spirit
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.580]   by faith in his promises to fight sin
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.740]   as justified children of God.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:22.740]   Maybe one reason God has done it this way
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.140]   is that every time we kill a sinful temptation in our lives,
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.260]   like the temptation to fear,
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.420]   every time we put to death a sin
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.500]   by trusting in God's promises,
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.020]   we show the devil and the world and our own consciences
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.260]   that Jesus is more precious
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.260]   than any promise sin could make to us.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.620]   That's what God is after in the world,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.940]   the open demonstration that Christ is glorious.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.980]   He's more to be desired than anything else.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.940]   So my final word to Eric is,
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.940]   yes, you have not been given a spirit of fear,
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.220]   but rather of courage, of self-control.
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.340]   That does not mean you won't be tempted to fear.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.500]   It does not mean you won't wake up
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.180]   in the middle of the night like I did recently
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.300]   with anxiety about five things
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.100]   that have to be done tomorrow
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.820]   and you wonder how you can do them.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.100]   You're not even sure how to do some of them.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.020]   What it means is that God has given you
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.740]   the resources to fight that fear.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.920]   He has justified you.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.500]   You're forgiven, accepted, loved.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.060]   He has regenerated you and you are a new creature,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.260]   new person in Christ, a child of God.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.580]   He has given you his sanctifying spirit.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.260]   He has given you promises like Hebrews 13, five and six.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.620]   I'll never leave you, Eric.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   I'll never forsake you.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.020]   So we can confidently say the Lord is my helper.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.300]   I will not fear.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.140]   I will not fear.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.460]   What can man do to me?
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.100]   And he has given you the promise
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.400]   that you are going to make it home to glory.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.640]   So keep fighting so you can say with Paul
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.840]   at the end of your life,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.060]   I have fought the good fight.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.460]   I have finished the race.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.260]   I have kept the faith.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.140]   Saved to sin no more.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.660]   I look forward to that day.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.700]   - Hasten the day.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.900]   - Amen.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.940]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.420]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.100]   Ask a question of your own like Eric did.

[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.500]   Well, we break now for the weekend
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.140]   and return on Monday to talk about
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.500]   what kinds of sin in our past
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.020]   could potentially disqualify us
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.220]   from pastoral ministry in the future.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.500]   One listener lived a life of fornication
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.380]   before he was saved.
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.220]   Does that history mean that he cannot pastor today?
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.440]   It's a great question.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.380]   And we will ask Pastor John next time.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.540]   We'll see you Monday.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:32.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
