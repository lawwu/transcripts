[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, does God want me to be happy or does God want me to be holy?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Which is the priority? Such a question is really, really important
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   to address. This time it comes in the form of an email from a listener named Megan.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Megan writes, "Hello Pastor John, I'm with you when you say that Christian hedonism says
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   my happiness is not at odds with God's will for me. But what about the dark
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   seasons of trials? In those seasons it seems my happiness
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   is not as significant as God's intent to grow my holiness.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   How would you describe the pains of trials in light of Christian hedonism
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and God's desire for my joy?"
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   If human life, apart from Christ and salvation,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   consisted in zero happiness,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   and God's goal were to bring us from the condition
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   of zero happiness to great happiness in God,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I suspect God would not need to
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   introduce any hardship into our lives, any discipline,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   in order to bring us to the experience
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   of supreme happiness in Him. But that's not
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   the real world. Human life, apart from Christ
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and salvation, does not consist in zero
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   happiness. It consists in a thousand experiences
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   of God-less happiness. When Peter
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   describes the pre-Christian life among the Gentiles
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   in his day, he says it consists in sensuality,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and lawless idolatry. In other words, the world outside
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Christ abounds with what Hebrews 11:25
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   calls "the fleeting pleasures of sin."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So when God saves us and brings us
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   into relationship with Christ and declares us
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   righteous, justifies us in union with Him
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   through faith, He's not working with
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   people who have zero happiness and need
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   to be given some. He's working with a person, with people
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   who have a thousand experiences of pleasure and happiness that are
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   not rooted in God, do not flow from a sight of God's
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   glory, are not abounding with thanksgiving to God for His goodness,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   do not reflect the character of God and His holiness,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   which means—this is amazing, I never thought of it
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   quite this way before—which means that through
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   conversion, God now has in
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   His family, in His house, children who
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   are deeply contaminated, all of us
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   deeply contaminated with the world from which He is
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   saving us because we still find
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   so much pleasure outside God and His ways
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and His will. So Ephesians 4.22 says,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   "Put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   and is corrupt through deceitful
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   desires." In other words, the process of
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   sanctification, the process of becoming holy
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   is the process of ceasing to have
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   sinful desires and growing
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   in our enjoyment of holy desires.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Or, to put it another way, holiness is the
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   newness of the human heart that no longer
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   finds sin and self more desirable
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   than God and goodness. To become holy,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   to be sanctified, is not
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   something different than becoming happy
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   in God. Sanctification
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   is precisely the divine work
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   by which we are weaned off the
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   pleasures of the world onto the pleasures of God.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So when Megan says—this is important—
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   when Megan says, "In these seasons of
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   darkness and hardship, it seems my happiness
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   is not as significant as God's intent
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   to grow my holiness,"
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   this shows a serious confusion
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   about what holiness is. She is
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   treating holiness as one thing
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and her happiness as another thing.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   She's treating holiness as
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   one thing which God pursues through dark seasons,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and that's exactly right, and she is treating happiness as a
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   separate thing which God seems to be neglecting in those seasons
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of darkness. That's not the way the Bible sees holiness
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and happiness. Holiness—now, this is the most
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   important sentence—holiness is the condition
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   of heart in which God is our
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   greatest happiness. That's holiness. The unholy
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   heart is the heart that finds
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   God boring or offensive
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   or false. The holy heart sees God as its
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   supreme treasure and is supremely satisfied in God, and when we're
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   perfectly holy, we will have perfect satisfaction
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   someday in heaven. So, when
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Hebrews 12 describes the discipline of God
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   toward his children—like she conceives it, she's right—the aim
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   is to make them holy, and it says, "God disciplines
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   us"—this is verse 11—"God disciplines us for our good
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   that we may share his holiness.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   rather than pleasant,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   but later it yields the
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   have been trained by it." Now, notice a couple things. The holiness
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   he is pursuing through this discipline is a
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   peaceful fruit. That means a sweet,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   restful, pleasant fruit. That's
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   the goal. And when he says the discipline seems
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   painful rather than pleasant, he's
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   not suggesting that the discipline doesn't hurt. It wouldn't be
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   disciplined if the spanking didn't hurt. He's pointing
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   to the fact that the outcome really
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   is pleasant and not painful.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's the goal. The goal of holiness is supreme
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   pleasure in God that breaks the back of all the
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   fleeting pleasures of sin, severs the root of all
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   those other pleasures so they lose their power and they don't control us
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   anymore, and we walk in sweet obedience to Jesus because
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   he has come to satisfy our hearts, which is why James
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   says, "Count it all joy, brothers,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   when you meet various trials," because you know that the testing of your faith
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   produces steadfastness, and why Paul says
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   we rejoice in our sufferings. Why?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Knowing that the suffering produces endurance, and the endurance produces
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   character, and character produces hope, which is of joyful
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   motion. So, my answer to Megan's final question—here's
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   her final question—how would you describe the pain of
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   trials in light of Christian hedonism
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and God's desire for my joy? And here's my answer.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   That the pain of all the
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   trials in the life of God's children is indeed
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   aimed at their holiness. Yes, that's true,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   because holiness consists precisely in
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   the heart's forsaking the fleeting pleasures
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   of sin and growing in the enjoyment of the
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   permanent pleasures of God. That's what sanctification
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   is. That's what God is doing in the hard seasons.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And the reason God puts such a high premium on the pleasures
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   that we have in God, even at the cost of great
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   pain to us in the dark seasons of our life, is that no
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   other pleasures can satisfy us eternally, and
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   no other pleasures can glorify God forever.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Amen. Amen. Sanctification is the divine work by
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   which we are weaned off the pleasures of the world
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and onto the pleasures of God.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Such a great and important line. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening
