[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   If you've had a terrible diet for all of your life and you've never exercised and you decide,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.080]   "You know what? I'd really like to have a healthier body," that's not going to be an
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.200]   easy transition. That's going to require some adjustments in your life. It's simple,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.280]   just like the simple path to wealth. I mean, what you need to do is pretty simple.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.320]   If you've developed decades of habit doing one thing, then shifting gears is not going to be
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.760]   easy. But the other thing that I think is important to recognize is that if you follow the simple
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.720]   path to wealth, you will, in fact, become wealthy. Because at that point, once you're there,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.000]   you can really afford anything you want. We fly first class now. I never would have been
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.520]   willing to spend the money because it wasn't worth it to me back when I was building my wealth.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.080]   But now, it's a rounding error. It cost me literally nothing functionally to fly first
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.960]   class. So, of course, I'm going to do it because it makes my life a little easier.
