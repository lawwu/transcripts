[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.200]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound, where we have the smartest audience in all of finance
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.560]   YouTube. Ask the Compound show at gmail.com is the email we get tons of emails every week.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.080]   Very smart questions. We have a great show for you today. We have not one, but two great
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.720]   guest experts. First, today's show is sponsored by Future Proof. Yesterday, Michael and I
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.000]   recorded a podcast with Matt Milton from Advisor Circle. Matt is one of the architects of Future
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.520]   Proof Festival. We discussed how it all came together, the evolution of finance conferences.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.600]   Over time, what makes this event so special. I even gave a few secrets of conferences.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.920]   I gave the icebreaker that everyone uses at every single conference you've ever been to.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.800]   You've got to wait for Monday to listen to that. If you haven't signed up yet, it's futureproof.advisorcircle.com.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.960]   When we talked about it yesterday, it got me all excited again. I think it's like 50
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.700]   days away, so I can't wait. Make sure to listen to Animal Spirits this Monday for some more
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.880]   background on it. Again, I share some of my conference secrets. It's going to be fun.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.560]   Cool. Ben's top 10 secrets.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   Cameras, shooting video. We'll be doing a live podcast. It's going to be awesome.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.200]   Yeah. Looking forward to it.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   It's beautiful. All right. Let's get into some questions.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.560]   Up first today, we have a question from Joel from the YouTube comments. "I feel like you
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.840]   guys get very similar questions in the realm of what should I do with my money next. Do
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   you recommend an order of operations that people should follow, like emergency fund,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.480]   money match, high interest rate debt, etc.? Would love to hear you talk about this."
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.880]   As a man of the people, I do dive into the YouTube comment sections. I pulled this one
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.080]   out myself last week. Great question, Joel. The textbook personal finance answer would
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   go something like this. First, you get the match from your 401(k). If you have one from
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.720]   your employer, that's 100% ROI. You can't really turn that down. Then you'd pay down
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.880]   high interest rate credit card debts. I think the average credit card debt rate right now
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.040]   is something like 25%, 27%. That's like 1950s Warren Buffett couldn't even beat that hurdle
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   rate. So, pay that off next. Then, once that high rate debt is paid off, you do three to
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.160]   six months emergency fund. After that, then you move back to the 401(k), max that out.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.600]   I think for 2023, it's $22,500. After that, then you go to the Roth IRA. That's another
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.240]   $6,500 for 2023. Then maybe HSA, 529s. Then finally, after all that's taken care of, then
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.920]   you can open a taxable brokerage account. I'm sure some experts might quibble, but that's
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.280]   like the stuff you find in most boring personal finance books. Here's my problem with this
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.400]   advice. First of all, not everyone has the ability to save this much money, right? Some
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.680]   of these buckets would never get filled because you just simply don't have that much money.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   Not everyone is that well off. For most people just starting out, I think the three to six
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.840]   months of expenses and emergency funds sounds awesome, but it might take them years to get
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.400]   to. So, it's just unattainable as a goal. Then maybe 2% of the population has the ability
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.520]   to save and invest like a robot like this. I'm going to check this off and check this
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.240]   off and check that off. I think it just doesn't take into account the human element. I think
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.200]   the actual hierarchy is different for people depending on their circumstances. Plus, there's
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.480]   the psychological effects of small improvements and building financial habits, especially
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   early on in your financial life cycle. Let's say you have a bunch of credit card debt,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.080]   which is a bad place to be because it's the biggest compounder against you. Let's say
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.560]   you have a Macy's card, a Target card. Do people still shop at Banana Republic, Duncan?
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.680]   Maybe a Banana card, a Gap card? Sure. I'm just kidding. If I'm being honest, I still
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.120]   shop at Banana Republic. Who am I kidding? Maybe a Chase Sapphire Reserve. I thought
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.880]   you were more of a J.Crew guy. Yeah, I guess this is probably J.Crew. Let's be serious.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.120]   I'm so mid. So, let's say then a Chase Sapphire Reserve because you want that sweet sign-up
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.960]   bonus and you have all these balances and you're falling behind. Textbook theory would
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.560]   say you take the highest rate and you pay that down first because that's math, right?
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.920]   But researchers at Northwestern looked at this and they looked at the debt snowball
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.200]   thing, which I guess is originally Dave Ramsey's idea. He hasn't had great investing advice,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.180]   his personal finance advice is pretty good. Did he steal it from someone? I don't know.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.560]   I'm giving it to him. So, they looked at 6,000 people at Northwestern who paid off their
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.480]   credit cards and they figured out what was the one guiding light here for these people.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.280]   And they found the people who paid off small balances first and got those small wins actually
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.880]   were the ones who stuck with it and paid off all their larger balances later, regardless
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.320]   of the size of the debt and regardless of the size of the rate. So, it's like this idea
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.760]   of finding these small little victories that give you the confidence to stick with your
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.200]   plan. And so, I like that idea for a psychological boost. I think that's a lot of what this is.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.560]   One of my greatest accomplishments this year has nothing to do with finances. It's getting
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.600]   my twin six-year-olds to make their bed every morning, okay? It took a long time. And I'm
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.760]   a guy who wakes up every single day, I make my bed first thing in the morning, right?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.680]   My wife has to love me.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.720]   I don't think that will surprise anyone.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.280]   No. But you start the day out with a small win. You set the tone, right? And I think
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.060]   the same applies to your finances. If you're starting small, I don't think you try to go
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.080]   through this checklist. I think you start small in some of these, and you build up small
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.160]   victories in each of these buckets, so you build good habits. No one starts out running
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.280]   26.2 miles marathon right away. Are you training for a marathon, Duncan?
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.160]   No, my wife. She's a marathoner.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.480]   Okay. So, I think you start small, and it's daunting for most people, again, to get to
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.600]   the three to six months and the 401(k) and all that seems so unrealistic. And I think
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.880]   most people just throw up their hands and give up. Well, I'm never going to get to that
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.400]   point. So, I think you start small, especially when you're young. I opened up an IRA in my
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.760]   20s well before I started. I had three to six months of emergency funds, because I knew
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.360]   that was just unrealistic. So, I think that's how I would think about it. Slowly but surely,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.760]   reach your goalpost. Don't try to do it all at once.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   That makes sense.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.960]   That's the hierarchy for me.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.440]   Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of off-putting. If it's something that seems unattainable, people
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.800]   will just give up.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.600]   The Carlson's hierarchy of needs is not as pretty as the Maslow's, but I think it works.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   I agree.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   Another question.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.360]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from John.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.680]   I love this question before you even get to it. This is a great question.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.040]   Yeah, this is a good one. "I find myself in a situation I know I shouldn't be in. I've
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.480]   recently returned to living in the U.S. from a country with a lot of U.S. tax treaties.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.600]   My equity investments had to be sold or taxed as if I sold them, as part of an exit tax
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.560]   before departing. I sold some years-long holdings and index funds with substantial gains, not
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.440]   to brag. Let's just say the amount would buy Michael many modern renovations. This money
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.960]   is now in cash or T-bills. Why is it so hard to avoid market timing and just dive right
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.080]   back into the same holdings? It was so much easier paycheck to paycheck."
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.200]   Alright, great question from John here. This is all psychological here, right? This has
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.920]   nothing to do with math. This is totally psychological. So, let's bring in two of my favorite market
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.240]   psychologists, Josh Brown and Phil Perlman. I think Phil has an actual PhD.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.000]   Hey, boys. What's up, fellas? Great answer to number one, by the way, Ben. Great job.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.440]   Thank you. And beautiful shirt. I love that shirt.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.520]   Thank you. I just learned last week from Doug Bonaparte that it's called a camper.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   It's a camper.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.040]   I just want to say, I am also a marathoner who makes his own bed every morning. So, how
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   about that?
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.280]   So, one of the pieces of advice that you get when you're young is, before you start trading
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.240]   stocks, start a paper portfolio. Or, let's think about this hypothetically. I always
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   thought that was a great idea at first, until you actually put real money to work, and then
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.540]   you realize, "Oh, wait. The paper portfolio is useless." Once you feel the emotions of
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.320]   making money or losing money, you can't describe that and recreate that on a spreadsheet.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.240]   The other thing is, one of the hypotheticals people will say is, "Pretend your portfolio
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.760]   was starting from scratch today. You are in all cash. You have none of the same decisions
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.840]   or tax consequences you had before. What would you do?" And I think that hypothetical is
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.880]   worthless, too, because there are all those things that are embedded in how you created
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.620]   the asset allocation and holdings. But this person actually has that. And I think their
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.160]   problem is, obviously, the siren song of market timing. Like, "Wait a minute. I'm in cash.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.600]   What if I just waited a little longer, and the market pulls back 5% or 10%, and then
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.400]   I could get in?" And I think that's the problem here, because they are starting from zero,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.320]   and you don't get this opportunity very often.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.280]   So Phil, I'd like to ask you a question.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.160]   Yeah, we'll go to Phil. I just want to say what's so interesting about the way this question
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.960]   is phrased, Ben, and I agree with you, it's a great question. This is not like somebody
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.240]   that got out of the stock market during the financial crisis and then sat in cash. This
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.740]   person was forced to sell, and they just did it. So it's like, "Why can't I just buy back
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:09.200]   the thing I sold? I had to sell technically. I didn't want to sell. Why is it so hard to
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.980]   just put the thing back on the shelf that I just took off the shelf?" That's a really
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.520]   interesting framing of this that you don't hear very often.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.160]   Yeah. So Phil, what's the psychology behind this? Because this person, the greatest thing
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.560]   is that they know that they have a problem. They've admitted it. "I know my emotions are
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.340]   getting in the way here. How do I overcome them?"
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:34.840]   So here's the thing about this, is the brain is so complicated, right? We're just learning
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.760]   a little bit about it. And so you're going to get answers from neuropsychologists, behavioral
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:48.680]   economists, especially the ones with the big egos that have really big words, ego, dystonic,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:55.840]   or whatever they're saying. And all of that stuff is nonsense. So there really is no good
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.160]   answer to that question. Why is it so hard not to be a marketer? We don't know. As a
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:08.260]   matter of fact, probably the best answer comes from Fisher Black, Black-Scholes. And he wasn't
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.720]   even an economist or psychologist. He was a mathematician. And he just said, "People
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.360]   just love the action. Maybe people just love the action. We just love the excitement of
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:25.600]   it." So there's an answer, but that answer actually does you no good at all because it
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.560]   doesn't give you any practical advice.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:36.360]   So what I would say is to reframe, to do this cognitive reframing, which is, "Sorry, I just
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.480]   used fancy words. I said don't use fancy words, but I just did it." Cognitive reframing is
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.520]   just reframe sort of what the problem is. And so the way that I would think about this
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.960]   is I would say, "Well, let's say that I was part of a club that not so many people were
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:59.180]   a part of." And this club is the Rational Actors Club. Nobody is a part of this club.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.800]   Everybody is crazy out there. Everybody's chasing. Everybody's FOMO. But if you're part
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.480]   of the Rational Actors Club, it's an exclusive club. And you write down on a piece of paper
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   what would be the rational thing for the rational actor to do. You keep it super, super stupid
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:24.020]   simple. One, for me, if it was me, it would be one, buy a lot of VTI. Just stuff my accounts
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:31.240]   with VTI. Two, buy more of it. Read Nick's book and buy more of it. And then three, never
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.320]   sell. And then if you think about that, if you frame that as, "I'm doing something that's
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:45.760]   special, not I'm missing out or I'm doing a boring thing." Back in the day, if you heard
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.200]   about a band before everybody else did, you were part of the cool crowd. You saw U2 at
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:58.280]   a club in 19-whatever. That would be the way to think about, "Hey, I'm doing this thing
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.480]   that is actually, it sounds boring, but it's actually the special thing that nobody else
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   is doing."
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:10.840]   - My favorite behavioral quote, I think from you, was, "The thing about behavioral finance
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.040]   is people are crazy." Was that your tweet?
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.000]   - Everybody's crazy, yeah. Everybody's crazy, right.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.800]   - But I think the great thing about this person is they realize they're crazy and they still
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.640]   are having a hard time doing it. I think that's the first step. Some people don't realize,
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.200]   "Oh wait, I don't realize that I'm making an irrational decision." So that's the first
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.800]   step for most people, is like, "Okay, how do I force myself to make good decisions ahead
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.200]   of time so I'm not making them under an emotional state?"
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.240]   - I have a question. Is it still market timing if you're just like, "The market, the S&P
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.600]   is up 2% today. I'm not gonna put it all to work today. I'm gonna wait for the next."
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   Is that market timing?
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   - It is.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   - Yeah.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   - It's a less egregious form.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   - Okay.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.520]   - I think the way to do this, the way I make a lot of decisions like this is, and I would
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.680]   have just as much of a hard time like, "Wait, now I'm all in cash and it's like, the slate
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.480]   has been wiped clean. Do I really want to put all this money back in the stock market
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.380]   with the S&P up 20% year to date, the NASDAQ up 40% year to date, and interest rates and
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.120]   all this? Do I really want to do that?" So I would have the same issue. But what I would
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.240]   do, and we've helped clients with this over the last, I don't know, nine or 10 years.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.840]   We've heard different versions of this. I would not write it down, but mentally write
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:25.880]   it down. Okay, which would be a worse outcome? Outcome one, you put all the money in, and
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:32.080]   there's a 20% S&P 500 correction. It starts an hour later. It could happen. And Ben actually
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.320]   did a famous post about, "Let's pretend you are the world's worst market timer." And I
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.760]   think you did that in response to all the people that were in cash thinking the minute
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.400]   they buy, it's 2008 again.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.760]   - All right, what if I invest at the top?
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.520]   - What if I buy at the top? And your work suggests, actually, forget dollar cost averaging,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.720]   even on a lump sum basis, actually, even if it's a worst case scenario, you get back to
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.200]   even way faster than you think, historically, which is my takeaway from your piece. But
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.760]   so I would say, okay, what's worse? That I buy it, and the correction starts that night,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.480]   which I suppose is conceivable. It's a low probability bet, but fine. Or B, I don't buy
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.960]   back my holdings, and then three years from now, the stock market is 30% higher, and I
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:29.520]   capitulate and buy back then. My point is, unless you're 70, choice A is worse. So if
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:36.600]   we're saying, like, this is choosing between two not great options, obviously, you know,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.960]   it's way worse to watch the market keep going without you, and then you buy higher anyway.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.840]   So I would take the risk that today is the start of a new Great Depression, and I'm the
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.860]   last asshole to buy stocks going into that. Take that risk. That's probably not the risk
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.920]   that's going to hit.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.320]   - Yeah, it's a rare minimization.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.720]   - Yeah. I get it, though. Listen, I'd be the same way.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.480]   - Good question. Alright, Duncan, let's do another one.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.400]   - Okay. Up next, we have, "I'm 26 and have been studying the market since I was 19. I
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.520]   realize the safest way is probably holding low-cost index funds in an IRA. However, I
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.720]   recently opened a Roth IRA with the idea of purchasing quite a few small caps and hoping
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.840]   for them to potentially 20 or 50X in 30 years. Since the Roth is a major tax shelter," oh,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.640]   yeah, that's why they use that, "I've talked with a few people who think it's a good idea
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.720]   and others who think I should just stack ETFs and let compound interest take control. Am
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.840]   I wrong for wanting to swing for the fences and what some would call gambling? With my
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.400]   timeline, even if all the companies go to zero, I think I'd be able to recover with
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.500]   proper position sizing. For context, I own a condo and contribute to my 401(k)."
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.240]   - I like this guy. Send him a laptop sticker.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   - Okay.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   - Phil, what do you think?
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.680]   - Another smart way of thinking about this, but they're thinking, they're asking for permission
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   to gamble.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.560]   - Are they? Is that what they're asking? He's not looking to day trade. He wants to make
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.360]   long-term investments. He just wants to bet on smaller companies that he thinks have the
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.400]   ability to outgrow the S&P. Is that the same as gambling?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   - He's a dreamer.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.440]   - It's not crypto shit. He wants to invest in companies. I really don't hate this that
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.440]   much.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:24.720]   - I would just have him add up all of his assets on one spreadsheet in one column. So
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:31.040]   he says, "I have a condo, I have 401(k)," and then he gets a number down at the bottom.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.640]   And then from that number, he makes a pie chart. And he says, "Okay, the majority of
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.480]   the money, I'm just going to put in ETFs and forget about it and keep piling in," and "stacking"
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.640]   was the word he used. "And then I'm going to take a small part over here and I'm going
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:52.240]   to buy those small, you know, I'm going to buy a higher risk stuff with that and play."
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.520]   And you know, two things could happen. One, he really does get super rich and he hits
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.480]   all and he has 100 baggers and 10 baggers or whatever. And two, he learns that this
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.960]   is a very hard thing to do, picking stocks like this and there's a lot of sharks out
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.320]   there and there's a lot of irrationality and our emotions get in the way. Either way, he
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.800]   learns and either way, he does the wise thing with the majority of his money. And with that
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:25.280]   small part, he also has this opportunity to gamble or as Josh says, you know, make good
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   risky investments.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.400]   Yeah, the fund account has to be sized correctly. It's 10% of my portfolio and I'm going to
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.040]   leave it at that. I just think that 20 to 50X hope is like bringing your expectations
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.520]   a little bit. That's my only worry. That's why I'm thinking it's gambling, because if
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.360]   that's your expectation, then you're bound to be disappointed.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:49.240]   He might be amazing. I suppose if you pick a few biotechs, you could get a 20X, 30X,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.600]   40X. Like if you pick a few biotechs that somehow miraculously get a pharma partner,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.920]   drug, gets FDA approval.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.280]   Just think of it like a VC portfolio that the other nine of them are going to go out
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.440]   of business and one might hit big.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.800]   Well, that's what I was going to say is like some of these might be zeros, but if you have
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.240]   a few that 50X, you should more than offset that. And if that's like what you need to
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.460]   scratch that itch, there's probably way worse ways to do it.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.880]   And we have no idea. This could be 94 for AI right now. You know what I mean? Like this
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.800]   could be like the early, early days of AI. And there's going to be a few companies that
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.860]   are like Intel or whatever that become these gargantuan, or Microsoft, they become gargantuan
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.540]   companies. We could be at the beginning of that bubble right now.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.420]   Just size it correctly.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.200]   If all of these stocks that he picks go to zero, then he just switches strategy and starts
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.640]   shorting all of the stocks he wants to buy?
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:50.700]   I still follow stocks. My first year as a stock broker, like the late 90s, I still follow
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.700]   the stocks.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.700]   There's a bubble crossing.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.400]   I still follow the stocks that we were pitching and we like most of them are zero by now.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.280]   It's been 25 years. But I remember there was a company called Cooper Companies. If you
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.160]   pull up, I think it's COO. If you pull up this chart, I think the stock's up thousands
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.580]   of percentage points. They make contact lenses like that. And that was the pitch in 98. We
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.580]   were cold calling and pitching. And the pitch was they make contact lenses like what? What
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:24.720]   else do you need to hear? And that's still what they do.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.660]   There are those opportunities that exist. But I remember that one because it's still
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.260]   trades. I don't remember all the ones that went to zero.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.580]   That's a $396 stock now.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:41.060]   $396. I swear to God, I think I was selling this at $5 a share. I swear to God. Now, most
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:46.940]   of the ones I was selling at $5 a share are gone. But I'm just saying, it's not impossible
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:52.340]   that you're going to get a few Cooper Companies-type home runs, but just don't count on it.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.420]   But if we're going back to the hierarchy question from before, this sounds like this guy's already
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.000]   checked off some of the other things and he's left himself some room. So, yeah. Pick a size
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.020]   for this part of your portfolio and then don't mess with it.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.620]   Alright, let's do another one.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.340]   Okay, so that question was from Evan, by the way. So, this one's from Peter. "My girlfriend
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.740]   and I have been living off my salary while she's in grad school, and we've been together
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.660]   for almost nine years. I'm financially literate, have a 401(k) and contribute to other investment
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.620]   accounts with any leftover savings. She is now making substantial money, and we would
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:31.100]   like to include part of her pay as a contribution to these funds. Do you have any recommendations
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.660]   on how to navigate these situations? She's not nearly as financially educated, so to
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.500]   her it's difficult to understand where the money is going. I feel added responsibility
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.060]   investing her/our money on her behalf, so I find myself in a strange place of trying
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.540]   to navigate relationships and our finances."
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.540]   I have more questions.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.540]   Me too.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.540]   Are we engaged?
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.540]   That's true.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.540]   Nine years.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.180]   This guy's like her/our money, which is gangster, but like are, you know, did we buy a ring?
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.940]   That's true. Trying to put them together. That could be, that's a big part of it.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.940]   Nine years is a while.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.940]   Nine years is a while.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.940]   It's a while.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.940]   Her mom is asking questions.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:12.260]   He feels responsibility about investing her money. I feel responsibility to know if you're
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.100]   investing that money as though it's going to be yours.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.160]   Yeah, he better show her the fund that's saving for an engagement ring here. I've told this
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   story before.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.660]   Where are you registered?
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.100]   Before my wife and I got married, we were engaged. I sat her down with a literal PowerPoint
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.580]   presentation to show her how we're going to invest our money, and it didn't go over well.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.580]   She's like, "What are we doing here?" She shut it down pretty quickly, but I was trying
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.660]   to have the conversation. I just went about it the wrong way, but this is a conversation
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.800]   that can be difficult if one person is really into this stuff and the other person is either
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.900]   just starting out or is not into this stuff. This is honestly one of the harder conversations
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.340]   to have, I think, for a person who is nervous or scared of investing in the stock market
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.020]   or just is overwhelmed by what to do. It can be a tricky conversation to have.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:01.580]   I don't really think they should have a conversation. I think he should just give her a few index
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:08.360]   funds and have her do that, and if he wants to log into the account with her and do it
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.660]   with her, but to sit down and explain investing to somebody who's clearly focused on their
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:20.420]   own career and making money. It almost feels like, let her, when she wants to learn, say,
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.660]   "I'm going to dedicate some time to learning." I don't think he should sit there and be like,
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.140]   "Okay, this is a P/E ratio."
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.300]   Right. Give her a target date fund in her 401(k) and make sure she gets a match and
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   call it good.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.980]   And maybe go to sales, guy. You know what I mean?
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.740]   I've heard these conversations before. Sometimes people who are totally financially illiterate
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.900]   or don't care at all about it, they see this and they're like, "Wait, I can't touch this
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.220]   money for how long? I'm putting money into what? I can't do anything with it?" So I think
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.720]   that might be part of what he's talking about. It's kind of difficult to get across.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.780]   You get across that by opening an account at a brokerage firm that she would have seen
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:02.580]   an ad or a commercial for. Not even joking around, Fidelity or Schwab is probably where
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.540]   you would want to have her investing. And every time she's watching like a tennis match
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:13.820]   or a golf tournament, she'll see Charles Schwab. That's the added comfort. It sounds silly,
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.840]   but it's real.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.220]   So if that's what we're talking about, it's just like, "I don't know about putting my
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.540]   money in this thing and I can't touch it." It's like, "Well, this company actually exists
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:29.360]   and they've existed for 100 years and many generations of people have saved this way."
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.060]   And also one last thing, we were joking and Josh was joking about the relationship and
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.300]   the nine years, but more seriously, you do want to define what this relationship is.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.600]   Is this somebody you're planning to spend your whole life with? You're going to be planning
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.480]   to get married or maybe you're younger, maybe you're never going to get married, but you
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.660]   are going to be, you don't have to get married to be with somebody for your whole life and
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.580]   have kids together and bing and bang.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.680]   And so you want to define, but you do want to define that relationship because if that
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.500]   is your plan and it's a strong plan there and you feel like you're on firm footing,
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:11.920]   then you want to be focusing the money together and making it a big pot so that you can allocate
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.080]   it that way, the most rational way.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.680]   That's a good point because the first part of the conversation is, are we going to actually
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.480]   put our money together? Are we going to have a shared checking account? Are we going to
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.240]   pay the bills together? Who's going to pay what of rent or whatever it is if they're
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.960]   living together? I think that's the personal finance stuff is way more important off the
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.360]   bat. How much are we spending on stuff before we ask, is this too much to spend? Those kind
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   of questions.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.480]   - It is rare though for people to cohabitate and live a whole life together, never get
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:46.080]   married and co-mingle their accounts. I mean, I've seen it before, but I'm just saying for
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.040]   the most part, most joint accounts are a married couple. It's fairly rare, even for people
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.280]   that live together their whole lives to take that next step and co-mingle all the money.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.760]   But I suppose it's something that you do see from time to time. It's just, it's a little
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.460]   bit trickier if God forbid things don't work out.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:09.040]   - Is there a rule of thumb for joint versus separate accounts for like married or in this
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.000]   case long-term couples?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   - It's subjective. It depends on the relationship, I feel like. It's probably no rule of thumb
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.360]   would really apply to everyone.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.000]   - I've heard people who do the separate thing and it works for them. I've heard way more
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.960]   people who say we do joint and that's, I think that's probably 90% of it, but I have heard
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   people who say--
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   - But they're married though.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   - Yes.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   - For the most part.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   - Yeah, but most people keep it together.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:37.920]   - You know where I see a lot of separate stuff with guys where like the wife is real, comes
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:43.680]   from a really wealthy family and her family is like giving her money all the time for
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.920]   various reasons. And it's not that there's like a secret, it's just like, you know, this
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.280]   is my dad helping us. You know, you see that with young couples in their 20s even though
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:00.200]   they've gotten married. You see that there are women whose family, and I've seen it with
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.840]   one of my friends, a male friend also, so I don't mean to say that it's one or the other.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   But in that case, you see separate accounts for married people because there's just some
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.240]   cash or some source of financing that's not necessarily coming from the job.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.560]   - Well, that's another question, another point of conversation. I had a friend who had signed
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.040]   a prenup because his wife's family was very wealthy. And he was fine doing it, but that
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.880]   could be a problem, right? Going into the marriage. Not a bad problem to have.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.600]   - Oh, no. I always say you sign that prenup because there are a lot of loopholes a lot
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   of ways around it.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   - Yes.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   - The most romantic part of the relationship.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   - Get your foot in the door. We'll figure out how to deal with the prenup later.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.040]   - All right, we've got one more question.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.040]   - Okay.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.600]   - Okay. Last but not least, I used to fall for the trope that personal finance was just
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:52.160]   like health when it comes to changing bad behavior. Investing isn't necessarily easier,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.120]   but technology allows you to automate good decisions ahead of time for things like contributions,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.760]   investing, rebalancing, et cetera. When it comes to working out or dieting, you can't
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.440]   automate that. So how do you go about changing behavior when it comes to your health?
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.000]   - All right, I'm not going to lie. I had planned this question for you.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.360]   - I was about to say, this question says Ben.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.280]   - This is a fantastic question because-
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   - I'll handle this.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   - Yeah.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.640]   - There are so many parallels between health and wealth, and they are so similar, and health
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:27.160]   is wealth. There is the planning aspect. There is the future self aspect, and you're doing
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:32.080]   things for your future self that your future self will look at you and say, "Hey, I love
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.600]   that you're doing that. You're putting money away, or you're exercising and taking care
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:41.720]   of yourself." But they're not the same exact thing, so there are some differences. And
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.580]   one of the differences is exactly what this question asks, that one, you can automate,
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.560]   but you can't fully automate it, so you can't exaggerate that because there still is emotions
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.440]   involved. I mean, you could have a completely automated market crashes and you're selling
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:04.960]   at the bottom. You can override, manualize the automation. That's one side point, but
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.480]   the thing is you're exactly correct, and I've thought about this before. One difference
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.360]   between health and wealth is that you can automate a lot. You can have this direct deposit
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.560]   automatically. You know, one of the greatest inventions of all time in the financial space
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:26.640]   is this automatic 401k, whatever it is, automatic direct deposit was genius. It was the greatest
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.360]   nudge of all time, right, to use a Thaler term. On the other hand, exercising, you have
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.640]   to do it all the time. You have to stay with it. Eating well, you have to do it all the
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.600]   time and stay with it over a very long period of time, and you slip up and you can really
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.680]   get away from it, and that's why we see so much weight yo-yoing in our society.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.640]   - Well, I think the set I heard in one of the books I read was like 95% of all diets
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.960]   fail. Like, you get on it and it works, then you fail. So, Phil, you've kind of made this
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.880]   transition into health and wellness. I'm curious, because I think giving that sort of advice
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:05.120]   is even harder than giving financial advice, so I'm curious how you've navigated that idea.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.200]   - Here's what you do. You find your gateway drug, in the positive sense. You find the
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.880]   one thing that's healthy that you love to do, and that will generalize over time. Maybe
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.400]   when you were a kid, maybe when you were 15 or 14, you loved to play tennis. You'd always
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.380]   go out and play tennis. You know what? Go out and buy yourself a racket, because chances
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.480]   are there's a part of you that still loves doing that. And then once you start doing
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.320]   that one healthy thing, it can generalize. Like, "Hey, I'm playing tennis now, and you
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.120]   know what? If I want to get better at tennis, I maybe have to start sleeping better the
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.160]   night before I'm playing, because I don't want to be tired. Or maybe I need to take
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.980]   off a few pounds, because I want to be lighter and I want to have more mobility on the court."
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:55.240]   And so, a lot of times, finding that one thing that we love. Our 12-year-old selves were
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.800]   our real selves. That's what we were just doing. We were just out there having fun and
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:07.540]   doing things we enjoyed. Or maybe it's something different. Maybe you love grilling. If you're
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.400]   creating a lot of animal protein to consume, that's really health food. I mean, don't believe
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.800]   what you hear in the media. Health food is beef and chicken, and it's on the grill, and
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.240]   it's really clean. But anyway, find that one healthy thing you love to do. That becomes
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.260]   your gateway drug, and it becomes a path for you to start doing more and more healthy things.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:35.480]   I agree with that. You know what I just started doing? Very manually, make my own sundae.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:42.240]   That was what I loved to do. So, I'm putting in the work. I'm not just rolling up at Carvel
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:52.360]   and having them do it. So, listen, it's really good advice. I think that's a really interesting
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:58.920]   question I had never thought of before. Ben said, "Is it harder to give nutrition and/or
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.640]   fitness advice than it is to give financial advice?" I would say way harder.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.680]   It's people's lives, literally, on the line. You agree with that? You've given versions
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.400]   of both. One other thing that you can do related to that is, and this works for wealth and
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.640]   health, and as a matter of fact, a lot of RIAs use this type of thing with their clients,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.780]   is imagine your future self vividly. So, think about, "Hey, you know, when I turn 65, close
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:31.740]   my eyes. What do I want to look like? How do I want to move? How do I look? How do I
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.720]   move my body? How do I feel when I wake up in the morning?" Imagine those things vividly
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:42.520]   and get really tuned into your future self the same way that you might do with your wealth
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   and say, "Hey, I want the leg caps." Is there a non-depressant way to do that, though?
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.600]   Here's the way it did for me. You can imagine really positive things. It could be aspirational.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.960]   When I had twins on the way, I knew I was going to be getting a lack of sleep and I
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.440]   was going to need energy. I've always eaten crap. I've worked out my whole life because
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.920]   of sports, but I've always eaten junky. So, you pick up a bunch of Nerdos.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.280]   No. So, I decided to change my diet a little bit to give myself more energy because I knew
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   I was going to need it for having three kids and two twins. That was the thing that set
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.120]   me on the path, using them as the goal. What did you do? What was the change?
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.880]   The Phil's thing of just, it's protein and veggies, basically. It's more, and that's
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.120]   the automation. Less carbs, less sugar, added sugar.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.560]   That's the automation, is eating the same stuff over and over again and then giving
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.160]   yourself a cheat day or two. That's my dieting automation.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.000]   How much time do we have? Can we do a very, very fast health lightning round with Phil?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.520]   Go for it. We have a couple of minutes.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.600]   Let's just fire stuff at him. All right. So, give us short answers so we can keep going.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   Okay. Verbose.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:51.240]   Like, just habits. All right. I'll start. Butter in my coffee. Good? Bad?
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.040]   I got no problem with that. Okay. You're good with it. Okay. Ben, go ahead.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:01.820]   How about no coffee ever? That's great, right? Yeah. You know, every person is an N of one,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.080]   and if you like having coffee and you can sleep at night, drink it. And if it keeps
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.920]   you up at night, even if you drink it at nine in the morning, don't drink it.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:14.400]   I've got one. Do you think that alcohol will be seen like tobacco in 20 years?
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.880]   Yes. And I also think sugar will be seen that way too.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:24.240]   Yeah. I just listened to Huberman's alcohol episode from August of last year. It's a year
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.640]   old now. It's great.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.920]   Honestly, I feel like I might never drink again. I mean, I'm going to drink tonight,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.960]   but I'm saying- Besides tonight.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:37.440]   The links between alcohol and cancer that he gets into toward the end of that are like
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.360]   the first thing that's really scared me. Like, I don't care that much about my liver. I definitely
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.080]   don't like the things that he was ending the episode with.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:51.540]   Neurodegenerative stuff. I have new clients who are sort of kindaholics,
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.720]   you know, like functional alcoholics. I give them that episode immediately.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.280]   And then what? Well, different people respond to it.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.400]   You're a big protein guy. Bacon, end of the world?
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   Great. It's great.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.800]   It's fantastic. Eat bacon. It is listed as a carcinogen, man.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.360]   Lay off a beer, eat bacon. All right.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.640]   Nah, it's not. Wait, wait. Salt, unlimited.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   Salt is fine. Salt is great.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.960]   As much as you want? Especially if you're schvitzing. I mean, if
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.400]   you have high blood pressure, you talk to your doctor and, you know, if you have any
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:28.720]   health problems, talk to your doctor. Here's a question I've gotten from people.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.960]   Why do you get benefits from intermittent fasting where you eat for like a six hour
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.400]   period of the day? What are the benefits from that?
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.840]   It's great. Well, first of all, it limits how much you're
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.200]   eating because you're eating in less of a window.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:47.000]   Phil only eats at midnight. Only eat at midnight and I only have one egg.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.680]   That's what I do. That's my secret.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.640]   I eat one egg at midnight and then I cluck like a chicken and then I go to bed.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.760]   But seriously, that's one part of it. It condenses the time you're eating, so you're
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.000]   not like always snacking. This whole thing about eating six small meals,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.480]   horrible. Whoever made that up, you know, probably Hostess Twinkie or General Mills
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.360]   made that up. Terrible advice.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.600]   So you condense it. The other thing is that it gives your body
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.700]   a chance to rest. And when your body is resting, it can do
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:25.880]   other important functions like autophagy, which is really just a fancy way of saying
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.600]   it can clean your body, it can get rid of dead cells, get rid of damaged cells and create
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.880]   new cells. So if you're always busy digesting, you don't
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.680]   have time to do autophagy to clean out your cells.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:45.760]   What window do you recommend? Is it feasible for a regular person who needs
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.720]   enough energy to get through a full day to eat inside of a six hour window?
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.280]   Is that too restrictive? It's going to fail, right?
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   The great thing about intermittent fasting is pairing it with high protein, low carb.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:04.240]   Because when you do that, what happens is your body learns to burn fat more efficiently.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.960]   You become fat adapted. And when you burn fat more efficiently, you
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.680]   don't need to eat as often and you don't run out of energy.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:17.440]   Here's the way it works for me. I do it during the week and I eat probably a little bit more
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.480]   during that window. And I don't count calories and I eat just
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.320]   the same amount of food. What's your window? How many hours during
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   the week? Probably like six hours like Phil.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.480]   So what is that, noon to dinner? Noon to six, call it. But I eat just as much
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.020]   food and sometimes more maybe. And then your body gets used to it eventually.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.120]   If you stop eating earlier in the evening and you're eating high protein, you will just
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.080]   shed weight. That is an early way to formula.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.080]   If you stop eating around 6, 7 o'clock. Oh, stop eating, okay.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.340]   And I've never counted a calorie in my life. Looking at the nutrition facts, that's too
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.400]   detolerant. Calorie counting is terrible. Eating high
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.520]   protein is fantastic. Should we have Phil back sometime?
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.120]   I love the lightning round. Yeah, lightning round is cool, right?
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.540]   See how I'm innovating? He's a food and market psychologist.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:14.560]   All right, I love it. If you have a question here, askcompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.040]   Thanks everyone for tuning in live. Pleasure to be here.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.960]   Appreciate it. By the way. Thanks to Phil and Josh for coming on as always.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.740]   See you next time. Hey Michael. If you're watching on YouTube,
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.700]   leave us a comment. Appreciate it. Thank you. We'll see you all next week.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.700]   Adios. See you everyone.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   Was that fun?
