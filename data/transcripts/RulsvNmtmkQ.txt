[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:11.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.680]   - Welcome back, Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.120]   Each week we get tons of questions from YouTube viewers
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.320]   and podcast listeners and blog readers.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.440]   And this is a show we created to answer those questions.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.660]   Remember, if you have one, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.960]   Duncan, we're in a nice little correction here.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.200]   So, last year, peak to trough,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.720]   worst drawdown on the S&P 500, 5.2%.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.040]   As of the close on Wednesday, yesterday,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.880]   the S&P was down 5.5%.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.480]   That doesn't sound too bad.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.520]   We look at other areas of the market,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.200]   NASDAQ 100 was down 9.2%
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.640]   and small cap stocks were off almost 16%.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.200]   So there is a market getting dinged right now.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.840]   I don't think our inbox reflects this quite yet.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.400]   We did get a couple questions on corrections.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.200]   We're gonna talk about that a little this week.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.680]   How are you feeling?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.160]   - I mean, things have only gotten worse
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.500]   for my robin hood since last week.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.080]   But the good news is I feel like
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.120]   I'm a little more numb to it now.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.640]   - I mean, that was the one thing
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.080]   that all these other stocks are getting killed
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.760]   and the stock market's still at all time highs.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.580]   That had to be the big worry of,
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.420]   okay, but what happens when the market rolls over?
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.840]   It's not like these stocks are gonna start going up
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.920]   when the market goes.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.400]   So, who knows?
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.420]   We're gonna talk a little bit today
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.440]   about how long corrections take
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.840]   and we'll get to that in the second question.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.120]   But why don't we do the first one here
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.080]   and try to think more positively?
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.040]   - Yeah.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.660]   Okay, so first up today we have,
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.000]   so I know it's a little bit of Michigan bias
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.440]   in the questions this week,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.320]   but that's cool, that's cool.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.720]   So, first, is it just me or does everyone hope
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.560]   to run into Ben whenever they're in Grand Rapids?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.760]   Second, we all know Buffett's feelings on the S&P.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.600]   Kramer says to put your first 10K
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840]   into the index every year and so on.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.400]   Does S&P 500 provide enough diversification
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.720]   over a 20 plus year time horizon?
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.160]   If I want to set it and forget it from age 30 to 50,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.360]   do I really need anything more than to automate into VOO?
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   And VOO is the world market index?
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.180]   - No, VOO is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.920]   So, there's a million S&P 500 ETFs.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.400]   He's basically saying one of those Vanguard S&P 500 ETFs.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.560]   And by the way, thank you to our flyover state questions
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   here, I appreciate it.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.640]   Someone coming from West Michigan, not a coastal elitist.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.460]   I know you're more prone to these New York questions,
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.000]   Duncan, but it's nice to know
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.980]   the West Michigan faithful's here.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.140]   John, let's throw up the first chart.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.780]   So, this person's asking, 20 years,
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.740]   how can I reasonably feel good about the S&P?
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.420]   This is the rolling 20 year returns,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.020]   going back to the 1920s for the S&P 500.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.220]   You can see there's a wide range of results.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.900]   The good news here, there has never been
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.420]   a single 20 year rolling period in the S&P 500
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.420]   to start at any month you want that has been negative.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.020]   Not one, obviously this doesn't include things
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.140]   like taxes and transaction costs and all that stuff.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.820]   Or inflation, but still, pretty impressive.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.520]   There's never been a 20 year period
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.140]   with a loss over the last 100 years or so.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.700]   But, that's a wide enough range between the best
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.940]   and the worst that you could drive a truck through it.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.060]   So, the best 20 year return, it was 18% per year,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.100]   ending in 2000, so you had this wonderful run
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100]   in the 80s and 90s, 2700% return in the S&P.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.380]   The worst return, you had a total return with dividends
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.940]   of 45%, that's like 2% per year for 20 years.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.180]   Of course, that started in 1929.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.580]   So, you invest in September 1929, over the next 20 years,
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.940]   not only are you experiencing the bone crushing crash
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.580]   of the Great Depression, then another 50% crash in 1937,
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.020]   but you're getting 45% in total.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.780]   And basically, your whole return there
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.140]   and then some comes from dividends.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.740]   The price was still not back at those levels.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.700]   So, I know a lot of people think that these days,
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.800]   the S&P must be enough because listen,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.260]   it's a globalized world, the S&P now gets something
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.940]   like 40% of its cash flows or its revenue from overseas.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.920]   I guess the problem with this in terms of diversification,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   there's a few things.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.580]   So, John, let's put the next chart up of the decade return.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.540]   So, this is returns by decade in the U.S. stock market.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.380]   And you can see the 1930s, we had sort of a lost decade.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.220]   The 2000s, you had this lost decade.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.340]   And then, of course, you have your good times,
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.700]   like the 1950s, the 1980s, the 1990s.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.120]   2010s were great as well.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.620]   But it's not like those are consistent
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.620]   from decade to decade.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.580]   So, you can have these bad times.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.460]   So, let's do one more chart here, the lost decade.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.020]   So, this is the total returns from 2000 to 2009.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.900]   S&P 500 at a total return basis was down 9%.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.860]   But then you have all these other components of the market,
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.580]   European stocks, mid-caps, high yield,
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.260]   the aggregate bonds, small caps, emerging markets, REITs,
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.100]   all did so much better.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.740]   So, you had this lost decade in the S&P 500,
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.460]   but everything else seemed to do just fine in that time.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   So, you had all these other sectors picking up the slack.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.500]   And now, of course, we're seeing the reverse,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.880]   where the S&P is doing so much better
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.180]   than these other components,
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.780]   and these other ones are lagging.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.500]   So, I guess from a diversification perspective,
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.940]   one of the ways to think about this is,
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.900]   could you hold the S&P 500 for 20 years and do fine?
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.260]   Probably.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.180]   The problem is, could you live through
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.860]   a really terrible decade to see what happens?
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.260]   Like, can you handle that?
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.420]   So, from a diversification basis,
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.740]   you're basically putting all your eggs
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.820]   in one basket of large cap stocks.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.940]   So, in the top five for the S&P 500,
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.800]   it's 23% of the total, okay?
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.260]   For the top 10, it's 31% of the total.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.220]   The top 25 is 43% of the total,
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.980]   and the top 50 is 56% of the total.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.380]   So, you're putting a lot of eggs
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.020]   in these one segment of the market,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.680]   these large cap US corporations,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.180]   which, to be fair, have done amazing
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.420]   over the past 10, 12, 13 years.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.980]   But I think, not diversifying enough beyond that,
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.780]   for me, personally, I would have a hard time doing that.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   - Yeah, do you think, looking,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.060]   I'm looking at those returns over the years,
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.760]   do you think people's expectations now,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.940]   after the last couple years, are set so high,
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.780]   especially young investors, that, like,
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.540]   having a 7% return is gonna seem like a bad year?
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.300]   - Yeah, and I do think that there's this thing
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.020]   where you see international stocks,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.040]   and you go, why would I ever want to own those?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.780]   US stocks give me everything.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.740]   I get all the tech stocks.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.760]   I get everything that's going well.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.140]   So, I get that feeling.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.660]   I just think you're setting yourself up
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.500]   for a potential concentration risk.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.380]   Even though the S&P is a diversified holding of US stocks,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.740]   it's specifically US large cap stocks,
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.780]   and then, going one step further,
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.860]   it's mostly US large cap growth stocks,
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.920]   because it's so heavily weighted
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.940]   towards those biggest names.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.100]   So, that's the way I think about it,
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.860]   in terms of, could you add a little more
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.700]   diversification in there?
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.260]   I think it probably makes sense.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.980]   - Cool.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.900]   So, up next, oh, that question, by the way, was from Ken.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.660]   So, Ken might find you in Grand Rapids at some point.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.500]   - All right.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.320]   - And, yeah, y'all will have a good time.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.660]   - If I'm with three screaming kids,
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.180]   you know that just, it's not my day.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.480]   - Yeah, I was wondering if there's a place
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.280]   you wanted to tell everyone that you hang out all the time,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.120]   that they could find you or something.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.340]   - Home, I guess.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.800]   - Okay, so, up next, we have the following.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.240]   I just started investing in 2020,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.120]   and this is my first real correction.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.480]   I know downturns are inevitable,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.760]   but how much longer do you think this could last?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.480]   Should I change the way I invest now
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.260]   that my portfolio is getting killed?
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.240]   - All right, so we talked a little bit
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.540]   about the correction at the start here.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.520]   Especially as a young investor,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.840]   if you've ever been through this,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.080]   you just have to understand that this is a feature,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.000]   not a bug, of markets.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.160]   So, John, let's do the quick chart here.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.760]   So, I look back from 1928 to 1921,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.160]   and this is intro year for a calendar.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.840]   How often do we experience a correction?
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.120]   So, basically, every year you see a 5% correction.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.960]   It's very rare that doesn't happen.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.200]   10% correction happens roughly 2/3 of all years.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.720]   You're likely to see a bear market one out of every four
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.160]   years, and then a 30% correction,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.240]   maybe one out of every 10 years.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.580]   40% is a little harder to come by.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.760]   That's more like one out of every 20 years.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.920]   And, of course, these are averages,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.740]   so it doesn't mean they happen on a set schedule like this.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.500]   This is just the average over the long term.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.560]   Now, as a young person, I'm not quite a young whippersnapper
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.480]   like I used to be.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.280]   I turned 40 this past year.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.080]   According to Social Security, like the actuarial table,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.040]   I should live to be 79 years old
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.000]   based on where I am right now.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.920]   Let's say, take a higher end of that.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.840]   Let's say, you know, Ben's in pretty good shape,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.800]   eats well, works out a little bit.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.960]   Maybe I'll live 'til I'm 90 or 100.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.680]   So, I potentially have four or five decades
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.720]   left ahead of me.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.960]   I mean, realistically, I'm planning on, I don't know,
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.280]   eight to 10 more bear markets, five or six market crashes,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.520]   and what I constitute like a market crash,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.160]   like maybe 30, 35% or worse.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.480]   I don't know, seven or eight recessions in my career.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.200]   So, if you're 20, you know, add a few on to that.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.620]   This is just something that's going to happen.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.640]   So, I did look back.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.940]   So, the first data I showed there was from 1928.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.640]   If you include the 1930s, there's way more corrections
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   'cause the market was just getting drilled all the time
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.880]   after the Great Depression, but if we go back modern times,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.040]   let's say 1950, post-World War II era,
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.240]   it's like 72 years of data.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.680]   There's basically been a correction,
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.720]   and what I define a correction as is 10% every two years.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   A bear market once every seven years,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.080]   and a crash of 30% or worse once every 12 years.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.600]   So, obviously, a correction is way more likely
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.520]   to happen than a crash.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.880]   Crashes seem like they happen all the time.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.440]   It's really quite rare.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.560]   Now, if we go to something a little more volatile,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.080]   like the NASDAQ, again, a correction probably once
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.400]   every two years, and this is since 1970,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.720]   a bear market once every four years or so,
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   and then a crash once every seven years,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.320]   and in the NASDAQ, crashes are way worse.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.160]   So, the NASDAQ data goes back to 1970.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.200]   The first big crash then was 1973, '74 bear market.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.000]   The S&P fell like 48%.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.640]   The NASDAQ was down 60.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.440]   Then we have the dot-com blow-up.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.520]   Tech stocks did way better in the run-up,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.080]   but when the S&P fell 50%, the NASDAQ fell 80%.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.320]   So, a lot of these times,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.480]   you're gonna get maybe better returns,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   but it's gonna be more volatile, more corrections.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.440]   Same with the Russell 2000.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.320]   The Russell 2000, since 1979, it goes back to,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.600]   it's seen a correction once every two years,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.240]   a bear market every four years,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.040]   and a crash once every six years,
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.880]   and since 2008, the bottom,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.960]   the S&P has had one bear market of 20% or worse.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.640]   That was last year in a corona crash.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.800]   The Russell 2000 has seen that four times.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.600]   So, again, depending on how diversified you are
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.160]   and what you own, the type of stocks you own,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.080]   you should expect to see these corrections and crashes.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.680]   It's just gonna happen.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.400]   Now, as to should you change your portfolio
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.260]   or your investment plan based on a market downturn,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.020]   I mean, I could count on one hand
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.540]   the number of people I know that can do that,
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.420]   that can say, I can change the way I invest
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.620]   from a bull market to a bear market and be fine,
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.580]   do it consistently and do it well.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.100]   I just think it's really hard.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.260]   It's really hard to do.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.580]   So, I think the idea here,
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.820]   especially for a young person who's decades ahead of them,
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.660]   you build your portfolio with downturns in mind.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.180]   So, the understanding that downturns can and will happen
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.100]   in your portfolio or your saving strategy
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.620]   just has to be durable enough to survive those periods.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.260]   So, either emotionally or asset allocation-wise,
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.100]   where you hold more cash or bonds
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.160]   to be able to see through that.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.000]   That's the idea here,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.780]   but I think trying to change your strategy
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.140]   just because something's going down,
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.940]   you just have to basically live with it,
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.780]   especially with a long time horizon.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.860]   - Yeah, I found the stat of 10% of years
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.140]   having a 30% drawdown or worse,
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.720]   I found that pretty surprising.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.820]   I thought that was more rare than that,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.580]   but that kind of put it in perspective.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.820]   - Well, yeah, I still think,
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.380]   I mean, so that's one out of 10 years, though,
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.220]   if you think about it.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.040]   - It's true, it's true.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.420]   But yeah, it just sounds so drastic.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.380]   But yeah, I guess we had it in just March of 2020, right?
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.980]   - Yeah, so, I mean, we kind of,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.220]   so there was one in 2007 to 2009,
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.860]   and not quite, you know, 12 years later,
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.040]   we had one again in 2020 or 10, 11 years later.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.240]   So, that one actually came kind of right on schedule.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.080]   But the other thing is, like,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.100]   the 50% crashes are even more rare,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.580]   but we had two of those in seven years or eight years
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.420]   to start of the century.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.500]   So, it's hard to say.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.580]   But yeah, I think this is just,
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.940]   this is part of investing, unfortunately.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.860]   Sometimes you just have to, like,
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.700]   learn to eat your losses, unfortunately.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.700]   - Yeah, I'm glad I missed those 50% ones.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.660]   Would have been a good entry, though, right?
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.260]   - Yeah, honestly, the best purchases I ever made
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.660]   were just plowing money into my 401(k) in 2008.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.980]   I think those are probably the best purchases
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.500]   I'll ever make as an investor.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.100]   Okay, let's do the next one.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.500]   - Okay.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.100]   So, up next, we have a long one, but a good one.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.100]   I think it's gonna need some clarification,
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.380]   but on some of these acronyms, especially.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.540]   I wanted to email you about paying off a mortgage early
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.220]   when you have kids entering college.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.940]   I've been considering paying my 3.25% mortgage off early
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.220]   as I have children entering college
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.860]   and I'll have them in college for at least 10 years straight.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.220]   I report assets for FAFSA starting next year
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.100]   and have been thinking about
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.180]   my expected family contribution.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.980]   I've been thinking of a mortgage payoff
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.300]   as a return of 8.25%, which is very solid historically.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.420]   I would have to sell stock to make this move,
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.420]   but should be able to minimize the taxes.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.260]   Am I making too much of the expected family contribution,
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.700]   EFC, number on the FAFSA?
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.180]   Could you ask your college savings expert
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.860]   how important, to the bottom line, the EFC is?
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.340]   I don't understand much of that question,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.180]   I have to be honest, so I hope you can explain.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.020]   - I think I can walk it.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.780]   So, the thing is, so this guy said he's got 10 years straight
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.700]   of putting his kids through college,
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.220]   and I thought, oh man, that's tough.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.820]   But then I realized my daughter is seven
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.260]   and my twins are four, so I'm gonna have eight straight years
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.460]   of putting kids through college.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.740]   Jeez.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.620]   So, honestly, a lot of this stuff is kind of foreign to me
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.980]   'cause I haven't got there yet.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.100]   But we do actually have a college saving expert on our team,
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.860]   Tony Isola, who is one of our financial advisors
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.420]   and specializes in this.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.140]   Tony himself was a teacher, not in college,
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.580]   but Tony knows all this stuff and helps people
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.700]   and helps some of our clients work through this stuff.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.620]   So, Tony, I think the crux of the question here is,
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.220]   when does it make sense to sort of move
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.060]   some of your assets around?
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.660]   And is paying off your house a good idea
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.020]   if you don't want it to come up
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.580]   on your financial aid package?
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.060]   'Cause I guess the idea is certain assets can count
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.860]   for you or against you when you're trying to apply
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.700]   for financial aid.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.220]   So what do people need to know here?
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.260]   - Well, I think what people need to know,
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.660]   I think we need to start from the beginning, right?
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.660]   Like, think about what's going on here.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.100]   People are making this huge investment,
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.140]   the biggest investment they're gonna make
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.740]   other than purchasing a home.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.100]   And in the end, they're not gonna know
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.700]   what the price is gonna be.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.860]   You're gonna apply to college and you have no idea
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.020]   what you're gonna end up paying.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.300]   That's number one.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.620]   Number two, you don't really have anybody to help you.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.900]   Even in the CFP curriculum, only one,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.780]   I think it's like two pages cover paying for college.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.500]   So that's for a CFP.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.300]   Your college guidance counselor, okay,
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.260]   doesn't even have to take a course in financing college.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.860]   They know nothing about this.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.420]   So it's a wonder, like, this is like a really
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.740]   more in-depth question, but most people
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.460]   just don't have any clue where to begin.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.580]   And that's the reason why there's a trillion dollars
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.820]   in student debt, okay?
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.020]   - So I guess if you're a parent trying to plan for this,
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.540]   when does it, like, it sounds like someone's like
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.060]   trying to hide assets in a Cayman Island offshore account
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.780]   or something, like, what can you actually do
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.500]   that can help you, or is it just context dependent?
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.220]   - It's context dependent, because let's talk
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.340]   about this question.
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.340]   There's so many nuances here.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.340]   If you're applying to a public college, right,
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.380]   they don't count your home equity.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.020]   So it might make sense to take some of your cash,
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.700]   which they're gonna count that a little over 5%,
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.700]   and use it to pay off your mortgage.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.460]   Okay, let's go to scenario two.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.220]   If you're applying to a more expensive private college,
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.780]   many of them use your home equity.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.900]   So let's say you apply to a place like, say, Northwestern.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.340]   They will take 5% of your home equity
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.060]   and count it towards you being able to afford college.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.780]   So if you have $500,000 in home equity,
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.060]   they're saying, you know what,
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.020]   nevermind all the other money you might have,
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.260]   we're gonna count $25,000 right off the top
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.300]   towards you, you know, that you need to contribute.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.780]   Like, they're expecting, this is how crazy the system is.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.900]   - So they're effectively saying, like,
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.660]   you should be able to take that 25 out of your house
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.700]   and spend it on college.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.420]   - You got it, in addition to other loans.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.860]   But I mean, the school costs like 80 grand a year,
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.940]   so there's all kinds of things going on there.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.620]   But my point is what the guy,
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.860]   he's asking like a really good question, but it depends.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.420]   And I also think that there are many, again,
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.140]   the financial service industry, for the most part,
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.500]   is just not the most moral place in the world,
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.940]   you know, as we all know.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.100]   And you have people out there
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.580]   really not knowing college planning,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.180]   and all they're telling you is how to hide assets,
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.540]   where that's not really where you should be looking, okay?
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.100]   You should be looking at the colleges
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.140]   and looking at colleges who are willing
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.500]   to give you money to go there.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.380]   And that's really a much better plan.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.540]   - It sounds like it matters, like,
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.500]   are you sending your kids to a public or a private school?
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.500]   That's kind of like the first question, correct?
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.460]   - Yep, it's very important,
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.780]   because you could go to a very good,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.820]   like, for instance, where you are in Michigan.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.580]   Like, if you live in Michigan, there's one price.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.180]   If you live outside of Michigan, and you're like,
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.260]   I wanna go to Michigan or Michigan State
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.860]   and sit in the crowd with 110,000 screaming lunatics,
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.500]   and, you know, have all this stuff,
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.620]   you're gonna be paying a lot more.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.180]   So you need to know what's going on.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.300]   Like, do you wanna pay more to go to a state school,
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.100]   where you can go, like, to a school in your own state
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.260]   for maybe half the price, right?
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260]   So there's lots, there's so many things.
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.500]   I think if we could bring up that, the first chart,
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.220]   where it shows the sticker price and the net price,
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.140]   this is what's going on here.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.060]   Like, you're kind of, to pay the full price in college
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.900]   is just silly.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.420]   - This one kind of blows my mind,
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.300]   because people think that college
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.500]   is so ridiculously expensive, but to your point,
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.940]   like, the majority of people aren't paying
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.500]   that actual sticker price because either a financial aid
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.540]   or some sort of ability to negotiate, right?
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.620]   - Right, right.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.860]   Like, here's the deal.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.420]   Basically, most schools, other than maybe the top 1%,
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.900]   have trouble filling their freshman class.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.460]   And what they wanna do is offer you,
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.300]   they call it merit aid, it's really a discount.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.460]   So it's almost like, you know, they charge you a lot,
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.500]   and then they know they're gonna cut the price.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.900]   So people, it makes people feel good.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.460]   It's almost like bait and switch, right?
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.660]   - It's like JCPenney, like,
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.980]   everything was on sale all the time.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.020]   - Right, right.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.180]   So they're like, okay, it costs 80 grand to go here,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.740]   but you know, you're probably gonna, you know,
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.500]   they know in the end you're probably gonna end up paying,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   you know, 30 or 40, and then the people who get that
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.700]   feel really good, right?
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.100]   'Cause it's like, oh, we got a scholarship
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.700]   or whatever they're gonna call it,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.580]   but in all, in reality, it's more of a discount,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.380]   and it's kind of a game.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.660]   And every year, this game changes.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.020]   They look for different things.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.900]   So I'll give you a hint for your readers, for your listeners.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:58.260]   Most kids, 90, over 90% of kids go to college
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.940]   within 500 miles of where they live, right?
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.700]   So just by applying to a college that's further away,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   you're probably gonna get more of a break
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.740]   because the schools wanna have diversity,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.220]   say, in their student body.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.460]   So you're gonna be a better candidate.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.500]   Like, you might have the same grades
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.380]   as someone from that state,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.180]   but they're probably gonna look at you differently
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.700]   'cause they're like, hey, we wanna have a representative
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.340]   from New York or Connecticut.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.500]   - So I guess instead of trying to figure out some way
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.780]   to beat the system and move your assets around,
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.100]   it's more important to have a discussion
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.940]   with your children about,
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.780]   where do you wanna go to school?
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.180]   And then let's target a strategy to that specific school
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.660]   instead of trying to game the system somehow.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.500]   - Totally right.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.540]   And let's take a look at that second chart with the map.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.540]   Most people, too many people don't even fill out
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.220]   the federal financial aid form.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.180]   And it's just silly because some schools actually
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.220]   use that form to provide merit scholarships.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.460]   A few, not too many.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.700]   But the other thing about the financial aid form
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.540]   is you cannot get the best student loans,
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.860]   which is the federal direct student loans
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.940]   if you don't fill out the financial aid form.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.340]   They have the lowest interest rates.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.580]   They tend to have, they definitely have the best terms.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.780]   And if you don't fill out the financial aid form,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.780]   you're not eligible for them.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.500]   And a second thing is like, again, these are simple things,
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.980]   like just fill out the form.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.900]   You might not be eligible for financial aid,
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.260]   but say you lose your job
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.460]   and some bad things happen in your family.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.940]   If you didn't fill out the financial aid form,
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.300]   you're not eligible now to like appeal and say,
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.180]   hey, look, my situation changed.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.500]   What can be done?
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.980]   So it's like a no brainer to fill it out.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.060]   - So this is obviously something people
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.260]   don't go through very often.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.300]   Obviously this guy is with 10 years of colleges.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.540]   I think this price,
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.620]   the price you pay for college by Ron Lieber,
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.620]   it's probably a good starting point for a lot of people
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.700]   because this is a very complicated process
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.300]   and they don't make it easy for people.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.980]   So that's probably the first place to start.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.780]   All right, so Tony, thanks for that one.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.700]   Let's go on to the next question, guys.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.740]   - Okay, so next up, another Michigan one.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.140]   Hi, Ben, longtime listener from Grand Rapids.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.220]   I'm thinking about opening a savings account
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.500]   for my kids who are one and three years old.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.700]   We already have a 529 for each of them.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.500]   What's the best tax advantage account?
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.780]   Custodial brokerage, trust fund?
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.380]   Would love to hear your thoughts.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.900]   - If you think mentioning my hometown
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.740]   is going to get people to get their question on the show,
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.060]   then you are absolutely correct.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.580]   I'm just kidding.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.820]   So when my kids were born,
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.020]   I opened a 529 and all their names,
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.340]   started funding it right away.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.700]   But I also had this idea a few years later of,
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.780]   well, eventually when these kids are older
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.860]   and they're going off to college
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.780]   or don't have high school and wanna do something with their life,
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.020]   they're gonna need some money for a down payment
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.780]   for their first house or a wedding
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.340]   or maybe just a deposit for their first apartment.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.100]   So I said, I wanna start an account for them.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.340]   So I just did it through
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.380]   our Simple Liftoff program with Betterment.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.620]   And through that, you can open one account
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.900]   and then you can fund each different goal.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.940]   And I just named each goal for one of my kids.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.220]   So I did that.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.540]   Tony, what are some other things you can do?
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.820]   Because I know, unfortunately, you can't really open
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.100]   a Roth IRA in your kid's name
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.060]   if they don't have any earned income,
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.180]   but what are some other ways you can do this?
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.100]   Well, I think you can't open, say,
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.500]   the Roth IRA in your kid's name,
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.060]   but you could certainly fund it
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:20.060]   and give them the money each year when they need it.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.380]   I think it's now at $16,000 a year that you can give out,
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.620]   and you could give more.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.820]   So I guess having it in their name
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.740]   is not that big of a deal
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.060]   if you're gonna give it to 'em anyway, right?
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.580]   No, and I really like the idea of the Roth
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.860]   because it's like a flexibility thing, right?
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.980]   Like if the kids don't need the money,
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.780]   you now have this extra retirement money
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.020]   that you're going to get.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.420]   You know, it's gonna grow tax-free,
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.060]   and you're gonna be able to withdraw it tax-free.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.060]   So I really like, as a secondary option,
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.100]   to the 529 is the Roth IRA.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.560]   Even though it's not in the kid's name,
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.820]   there's no law that says you can't take
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.700]   any of the principal you put in over the year
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.580]   and no tax consequences, give it to your children.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.980]   So that's a big thing.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.980]   And I think if we look at the other,
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.120]   the total savings chart that I had given out,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.740]   it's unfortunate, but many people,
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   like here's how we pay for college.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.700]   I think 529s are by far the best way.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.020]   But you see, many people don't even know what a 529 is,
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.700]   and there's a lot of misinformation.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.100]   Oh, what happens if my kid doesn't go to college?
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.460]   Well, first of all, you know,
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.760]   you can use it for trade school.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.940]   You could use it for anything
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.740]   that's eligible for federal loans.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.340]   So if your child wants to be a chef
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.180]   or an electrician or a plumber, you can use 529.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.020]   - Well then, worst case scenario,
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.780]   you just end up paying the taxes after the fact, right?
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.100]   - Yeah, and all you do is pay taxes on the earnings, right?
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.720]   Whatever you, it's just the earnings.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.420]   And most people, let's look at, you know, the next chart.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.060]   What do people have saved?
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.660]   Like, what are you really worried about?
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.740]   You know, like the average person has saved,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:05.740]   that's one year of public school, right?
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.020]   A private school tends to cost
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.380]   between, you know, 60 and $80,000 a year.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.980]   So a public school, you know,
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.460]   tends to cost between like maybe 22 to 27.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.020]   So, you know, people are like worrying about these things
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.420]   that like they're gonna have like millions of dollars
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.600]   in this account, like, you know, like you said, Ben.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.140]   Secondly, you can change the beneficiary.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.620]   So you can use that money yourself
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.620]   if you want it to further your education,
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.740]   or if your kids have kids, your grandchildren,
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.580]   you could use it for them.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.620]   So I really don't see how people get these insane ideas
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.340]   that if you fund the 529 plan,
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.900]   there's going to be no use for the money.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.800]   And like I said, it's not like they're putting in
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.620]   like $200,000 a year.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.420]   What the average person is probably putting in
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.380]   $100, $200 a month, right?
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.220]   - Good point.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.140]   - Yeah, I think 529s are, I was just gonna say,
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.460]   they seem way more versatile than I think a lot of people,
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.540]   like Tony's saying, think.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.540]   A lot of people, I think, think that it's only
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.020]   for like a four-year university and, you know,
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.860]   that kind of thing.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.580]   - And it's graduate school.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.120]   Graduate school too, 'cause then people are like,
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.180]   well, what happens if we get a full scholarship?
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.300]   Again, like 1% of the people get full scholarship, right?
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.300]   They always come up with crazy scenarios.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.540]   - That's a good problem to have, right?
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.820]   - Of course, it's a good problem.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.420]   And how about this, let's take this one step further.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.900]   If you're that smart that you're gonna get
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.080]   a full scholarship, right?
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.680]   You're probably gonna go to graduate school,
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.520]   don't you think?
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.340]   Like law school or medical school.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.180]   - It's like it is a fact, yeah.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.620]   - And now you use it for that.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.060]   And they don't give out scholarships for the most part
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.540]   like they would in, you know, in a four-year school,
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.780]   in graduate school.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.860]   It's much harder to come by the money.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.420]   So again, it's like, you know, people just say,
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.820]   they just say crap that's just not true.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.380]   You know, they tell people don't fill out
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.540]   the financial aid form, don't put, you know,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.380]   like there's just so much misinformation that's out there.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.140]   This is why we have a disaster, quite frankly,
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.860]   with people paying for college
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.860]   because they don't have the right expectations.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.880]   And then there's the guilt factor.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.220]   Oh, my son or daughter got into Cornell or something.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.940]   We didn't really save enough, but we're not eligible for aid
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.300]   'cause we're kind of middle-class.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.860]   So now we're on the hook for $320,000 a year.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.080]   And no one thought about like that.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.740]   What happens if they get in and we get nothing?
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.580]   You understand?
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.940]   So like we have major situations here
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.540]   where people end up spending enormous amounts of money
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.420]   they don't have, so they have to borrow
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.060]   because they didn't set the proper expectations.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.100]   That's what we try to do.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.060]   Like when we talk to clients and stuff and tell them,
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.540]   look, here's, you need to know this before you apply
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.860]   what you're gonna end up spending.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.140]   But the problem is like, I have software,
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.020]   I have all kinds of tools to do this.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.060]   The average person is like, is completely unarmed.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.540]   - Yeah, and if anyone wants to check it out,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.340]   go to tonyisola.com.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.700]   That's his blog, A Teachable Moment.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.660]   Find his email there and shoot him an email.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.820]   I'm sure he will be happy to answer your questions.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.660]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.140]   Any questions you might have, absolutely.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.820]   - And Tony, I do see you have a Giants sweatshirt on there.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.660]   - Yes, I do.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.020]   - I just wanna say, I'm kind of sick of you New Yorkers
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:09.940]   complaining about the Giants.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.460]   You've won two Super Bowls in the last like 15 years.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.300]   - Oh, yes.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.220]   - The Lions are the worst professionally run organization
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.060]   in the world.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.540]   I'm sick of hearing you Giants fans complain.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.260]   You won two Super Bowls in the last 15 years
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.620]   and we've won one playoff game in the last 40.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.820]   - Yes, but on the other hand,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.540]   the Lions were like the 86 Bears this year
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.620]   compared to the Giants.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.700]   So we have to look at the recency effect also is in play.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.900]   So there's always that going on.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.300]   - If you have some thoughts about any of the stuff
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.340]   we talked about today, Tony's 529 stuff.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.220]   Tony is very pumped up about this, if you can't tell.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.660]   Leave some comments, let us know what you think.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.260]   Question for the show, email us,

[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.180]   Shop, what's our shop called?
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.060]   idontshop.com.com. - idontshop, yeah.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.140]   - You can get a Ben doesn't drink coffee mug there,
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.540]   which is still true, I still don't drink coffee.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.580]   And we will see you next week.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.580]   - See you, everyone.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.960]   (upbeat music)
