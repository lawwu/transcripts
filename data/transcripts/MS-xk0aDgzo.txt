[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   rabbit holes for me are my favorite thing in the world they're also dangerous right last night is
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   a great example so you probably tell my voice that we're covering from a little bit of a cold
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.720]   i was in a rabbit hole till 11 50 at night and i'm supposed to meet you early this morning and
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.600]   i'm just like researching this new type of high bandwidth memory that's only used in ai chips and
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.880]   you know nvidia uses them amd uses them all the big ai providers that are building these gpus to
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.640]   train all these ai models and i'm like oh if i can find out which publicly traded companies are the
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.600]   suppliers that are providing this that's an investment opportunity and i'm like going so
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.840]   deep and i'm like having ai do all the deep due diligence and research for me and i'm like what
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.840]   am i doing it's like midnight but it just shows you when you get geeky about something and yeah
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.440]   that could be anything right you just go down this rabbit hole
