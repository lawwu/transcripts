[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   You get an interesting mix of doctors, I've talked to a fair number of them,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.560]   and a lot of them are refugees from the U.S. healthcare system
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.840]   because they're tired of being harassed by the insurance companies
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.480]   to keep things moving along, to meet quotas because the reimbursement rates are so low.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.080]   So, at Bologna, for example, it's the top international medical travel hospital in the world.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.920]   Some 45% of their patients are from other countries,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.560]   but they have 300 American board-certified doctors and surgeons in that hospital.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920]   That's an anomaly. So, if you're checking on credentials,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120]   you know, again, you're doing your own research, you're referring yourself.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.200]   You have to trust that, you know, the University of Birmingham in the U.K.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.560]   puts out good doctors. On the other hand, in the United States,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.920]   one out of every seven surgeons is of Indian descent.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.680]   They were trained in India, and they're now in the United States.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.120]   And people don't really question that because they have a higher level of comfort
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.720]   when they're in the United States.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   If they knew this exact same doctor was going to treat them in Bangalore or Chennai,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.520]   they might run 100 miles from that.
