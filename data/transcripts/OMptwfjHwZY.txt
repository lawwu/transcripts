[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   I know some of you are driving around and maybe cannot see the title of today's episode.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.680]   It's a sensitive one, just a heads up.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.600]   Today we field a question from a listener named Ben.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.240]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.560]   Beginning as a 10-year-old, I became addicted to porn videos.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.760]   It was my primary battle for the next seven years.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.380]   There have been wonderful victories along the way, but I also know these videos are
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040]   unrealistic and perverse.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.180]   Models designed for sex must be a lot different than what I've seen, but what I've seen is
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.080]   the only model I know.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.020]   As I look forward to marriage, I fear that what I watched has already patterned my expectations.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.380]   What advice do you have for me?
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.440]   Is there any hope that I will experience loving, godly, healthy intimacy in marriage?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.020]   And what can I do now to ensure it?
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:59.200]   The answer is, there is hope for a loving, godly, healthy intimacy in marriage if, in
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.360]   God's mercy, a cluster of miracles happen in you and in your future wife.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.180]   I'm talking about spirit given, subconscious transformation of your instincts, what you
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.840]   unthinkingly do, and conscious steps you can take together with this woman that you might
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.700]   fall in love with based on God's Word for guarding your relationship from sin and for
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.080]   deepening and purifying your experience of intimacy.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.520]   So yes, there's hope.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.420]   This will not be automatic.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.160]   Just because you're a Christian, you must pursue these miracles.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.220]   One of my concerns in even addressing Ben's question or talking to him directly in this
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.280]   way is that I can't tell from his question whether he has gotten victory over this or
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.800]   not because he says, "There have been wonderful victories along the way."
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.520]   That doesn't sound like—and maybe he just didn't choose his words carefully—but
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.000]   it doesn't sound like the pornographic videos are behind him, but that he keeps returning
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   to them, perhaps with less frequency.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720]   That's not going to do.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.320]   You can't set your sights that low, Ben.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.600]   And if there's any woman listening to this who is considering marriage, you should ask
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   a man point blank the last time he looked at anything pornographic, and you should insist
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   on victory never to look at pornography, not simply infrequent exposure.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.320]   Too many people today think that pornography is just inevitable.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.960]   It's a given and that marriages should just cope, just adapt to it.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.100]   I think that's like saying poison is inevitable, and I'm just going to get used to taking
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.280]   poison.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   Here's my suggested path toward hope, Ben.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.680]   First, humble yourself by admitting that for the rest of your life, those seven years of
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.240]   poisoning your mind are going to have consequences that you are responsible for and that will
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:38.880]   require unusual self-abasement in relation to your sexual expectations and your wife.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.160]   Here's what I mean.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.680]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 6, 18-20, "Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.920]   Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.080]   from God?
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   You are not your own."
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.880]   What a powerful statement.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.180]   You are not your own, for you were bought with a price, namely the blood of Jesus.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.760]   So glorify God in your body.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:16.400]   So no longer is your body and its sexual desires and its engagement with your wife, no longer
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   is it vulgar.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.000]   It is holy.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   The body is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, and Paul says that, that, knowing
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.000]   he's going to give instructions one sentence later in chapter 7, verse 3, how a man and
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.560]   his wife should have sex.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.720]   Sexual relations in marriage are not vulgar.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   They are pure in Christ.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:51.600]   So Ben, if you are a Christian, your perversely distorted brain belongs to God.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   He bought you.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.120]   He knew what he was buying.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.080]   He bought you body and soul by his blood.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.920]   You are not your own.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.120]   He bought you so that he could indwell you, and the one who indwells you is explicitly
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.600]   called holy, and that is your calling.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.080]   Be holy because you are bought to be holy and indwelt by the Holy One.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:26.040]   Now comes these astonishing words in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 3, "The husband should give his wife
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.960]   her conjugal rights," that is, he should give her sexual satisfaction, "and likewise
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.200]   the wife to her husband," same, sexual satisfaction, his conjugal rights, "for the wife does not
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.640]   have authority over her own body, but the husband does.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.960]   Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.520]   And he's speaking specifically about sexual intercourse.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.040]   In those marriage bed moments of intimacy, that's the law he lays down.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.020]   Now that's a mysterious and wonderful and paradoxical thing to say, right?
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.400]   Just when a man thinks he can do whatever he pleases sexually with his wife, because
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.240]   he's got that authority, Paul says that she can do whatever she pleases sexually with
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.760]   her husband, which very likely will include informing him that some of the things that
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.040]   please him do not please her, thank you very much, and she would like it if he wouldn't
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.640]   do them.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.560]   Now you see how paradoxical this is?
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:45.520]   This is very much like Paul's command in Romans 12.10, "Outdo one another in showing
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   honor."
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   How do you do that?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   Like, "I'm going to beat you.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   No, I'm going to beat you.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.200]   I'm going to show that I honor you more.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   No, I'm going to show that I honor you more."
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:04.000]   Which in the marriage bed means, "Outdo one another in seeking to maximize each other's
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.720]   pleasure."
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.920]   Each other's pleasure.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:17.280]   Or another way to say it would be, "Each of you strive to find your greatest sexual pleasure
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.120]   in the greatest sexual pleasure of your spouse."
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:29.480]   Now Ben, with regard to your history, what this means is that you will not assume that
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.760]   you know best the acts of intimacy which will bring your wife greatest satisfaction.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.920]   You will assume that your mind is distorted.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.640]   In fact, all of us should assume that.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.800]   That's why there should be a lot of talking.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.440]   Therefore, you will be especially humble, especially hesitant to put your immediate
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.800]   desires forward as a guideline for what happens in the marriage bed.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.480]   This is why I said miracles will have to happen in your heart and her heart.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   And that leads me to the next part of your path toward hope, namely that you, perhaps
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:16.840]   even more than most husbands, though we all need it, will need to talk with her very frankly
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.320]   about what pleases her.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:28.040]   You will have acknowledged to her very early in your relationship, before the marriage,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.960]   all about your history sexually.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.640]   Before your marriage, early in the relationship, and you will admit to her that you probably
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.480]   do not have the best instincts and inclinations when it comes to the most healthy ways of
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.520]   sexual intimacy in marriage.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.640]   She will need to know all about this ahead of time so that she can decide if she's going
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.080]   to take a risk on you.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.200]   Don't you dare hide this from her, spring it on her after you're married, and know then
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.360]   there's no way out.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.280]   That would be very disingenuous, dishonest, evil of you to do that.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:11.560]   And then the two of you in marriage over time, if she's moved forward with you, will learn
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   to talk.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.520]   You'll learn how to talk.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:22.600]   And from your talk, you will learn a kind of unspoken language, a kind of delicate signaling,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:31.100]   so that there emerges over time a natural rhythm of intimacy that both of you find sweetly
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.440]   and deeply satisfying.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.720]   And let me mention one absolutely crucial feature of this satisfying intimacy.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:47.400]   I think it would be fair to say that every mature, healthy woman in marriage wants to
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:56.860]   enjoy her husband and wants to be enjoyed by her husband, but not used by him.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:05.100]   So what's the difference between your wife being enjoyed by you and being used by you?
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:12.800]   I'll put it in one sentence as best I can and then mention three ways to make it a reality.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:21.740]   A woman will feel properly enjoyed by her husband rather than used if she can tell that
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:29.420]   he is delighting in her body and her person as one.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:38.900]   If physical enjoying and personal cherishing are united, it will be crystal clear when
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.960]   and how the husband is enjoying her body.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:49.580]   But it needs to be made clear that in this enjoyment, he is cherishing her person.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.900]   In other words, it's pretty obvious to a woman when he's enjoying her body.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.060]   It may not be as obvious to her that he is cherishing her person.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:07.740]   So here are three things that contribute to this, this beautiful sense of not being used
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:15.520]   but being enjoyed by both the cherishing of a person and the enjoying of a body.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.500]   One is words.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:24.500]   He may not be a poet, but he can say to her in the moment, "I love you.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.140]   I want no other.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:36.380]   My eyes and my hands go after no other with the desire to do what we are doing now.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.100]   You are precious to me.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.540]   I cherish you."
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.020]   He can say that.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.420]   He can say that.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.740]   Words matter.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.940]   Secondly, eye contact.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:57.980]   Don't either of you give the impression that as you move toward the height of delight,
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.900]   you lose personal contact and float into some dream world abstracted from the person in
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.700]   your arms?
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.460]   Open your eyes.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:18.460]   Look as deeply into your spouse's eyes as you can, down into the very soul, and say
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:27.140]   with your eyes, "You, you only, you only, and forever you."
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.100]   And finally, and this is true for everyone, but especially, Ben, for people with your
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:40.900]   background, through all the communication and experimentation, build that beautiful
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:52.860]   garden of pleasure with a hedge around it made out of her glad desires and permissions.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:00.940]   So set your face, Ben, in these next years to pursue holiness and purity and deep transformation,
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.660]   and there will be hope for you.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.460]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the very open and honest question, Ben.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.660]   You can ask your own open and honest question to Pastor John, or you can browse all 1,600
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.060]   of our past answers, or you can subscribe to the podcast.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:21.500]   You can do all of those things online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.220]   Well we live in a fog of triviality.
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.700]   Everything is funny.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.820]   Nothing is sacred.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.940]   Everything is irony.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.180]   So how can we rise above the trifling effects of the culture all around us?
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.300]   That's the question on Wednesday that we will be addressing.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.620]   It's an important one, very important topic.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.620]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.860]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.220]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.060]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.060]   [END]
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.060]   1. What is the Holy Spirit?
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.060]   2. What is the Holy Spirit?
