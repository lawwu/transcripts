[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Well, we begin the new week on the podcast going into a deep theological question, but
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.140]   hang with us for a moment.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:18.100]   The question is this, if God has two wills, a will of decree and a will of desire, does
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.560]   God ever decree something to happen that he does not desire to have happen?
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.320]   And if so, wouldn't he have a divided mind?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.120]   Now before you skip this episode, give us a chance to explain more about it because
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.560]   it's a sharp question from a listener named Ethan.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.880]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.560]   When reading through and discussing the themes at the outset of Desiring God, your book,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.840]   along with does God desire all to be saved, a perplexing theological question comes to
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   mind.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.920]   If God indeed has two wills, one of desire and one of decree, which are both biblically
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.720]   affirmed, how then does his will of decree overrule, in a sense, his will of desire?
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.220]   If God's sovereignty is the foundation of his happiness, as in chapter one of your book
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.760]   Desiring God says, then it seems as if the two wills idea is somewhat insufficient in
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.680]   addressing texts such as 1 Timothy 2, 3-4.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.120]   In other words, if God's sovereignty is the foundation of his happiness, how is it possible
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.880]   for his will of decree to act independent of his will of desire?
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.720]   Well let me see if I can help the listeners get into the discussion here, because this
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.440]   is probably landing on them with "huh?"
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.000]   Ethan is referring to an article I wrote, "Are There Two Wills in God?"
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.840]   And what I was trying to do is show that sometimes the Bible treats the will of God as his absolute
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   sovereign decree by which he plans everything and sees to it that everything he plans comes
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.280]   to pass.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.700]   And sometimes the Bible treats the will of God as something that he commands, but which
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.000]   in fact does not always come to pass.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.480]   Let me give an example.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.920]   In the Ten Commandments, it is clear that God commands, "Thou shalt not murder."
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.480]   So it's right to say God's will is that human beings not murder each other.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.400]   And yet we know from Acts 4, verse 27-28, that Herod and Pontius Pilate and the Gentile
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.160]   soldiers and the peoples of Israel on Good Friday did, quote—this is what the Bible
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   says—they did whatever your hand, God, and your plan—that is, your will—had predestined
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   to take place.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.400]   Now what's that?
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   Well, namely, they murdered Jesus.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:22.840]   So in another sense, it was God's will that his Son die at the hands of murderous, sinning
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.080]   people.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.600]   God willed the murder of his Son.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.320]   It's written through the Old Testament.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.880]   It's written in the New Testament.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.240]   The death of Jesus at the hand of sinning murderers was the will of God.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.800]   So even though the Ten Commandments says, "Thou shalt not murder."
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.440]   So when I speak of two wills in God, I'm simply describing what I find in Scripture.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.840]   And of course, hundreds of theologians before me in the centuries of church history have
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.680]   seen the same thing, and I'm simply using the language that has been developed to describe
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.080]   these two wills.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.720]   We can call them the will of command and the will of decree—that would be one way.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   Or we could call them the revealed will of God and the sovereign will of God.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.080]   These terms simply refer to the fact that sometimes the will of God—the phrase "will
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.400]   of God"—refers to the sovereign plan of God that always comes to pass, and sometimes
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.880]   the phrase "will of God" refers to what he commands, which does not always come to
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   pass.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.680]   Now, Ethan is simply making explicit the fact that sometimes the Bible talks about God desiring
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.360]   something that in fact he does not decree to happen.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.720]   For example, he refers to 1 Timothy 2.4.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.800]   This is a very famous text.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.760]   God desires all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:14.200]   And yet, just a few chapters later in 2 Timothy 2.24 and 25, Paul says this, "The Lord's
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   servant should be correcting his opponents with gentleness.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   God may perhaps grant them to repent, leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil after being captured by him to
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.800]   do his will."
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:44.160]   So if we put those two texts together, 1 Timothy 2.4 and 2 Timothy 2.25, what we see is that
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.600]   on the one hand, God desires all people to repent and come to a knowledge of the truth
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.800]   and be saved, and on the other hand, he may or may not grant them to repent and come to
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.400]   a knowledge of the truth and be saved.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.600]   And of course, this is not the only passage where we're told that all human beings are
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.560]   dead and helpless in their trespasses and sins, and only God can deliver them.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.240]   So Ethan asks two questions that he's troubled about.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.840]   One, does God's will of decree overrule, in a sense, his will of desire?
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:35.720]   And two, he asks, if God's sovereignty is the foundation of his happiness, how is it
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:44.000]   possible for his will of decree to act independent of his will of desire?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.640]   Now, the answer to the first question is this.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:55.800]   It's not helpful to speak of God's will of decree overruling his desire, because that
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.120]   implies a conflict or tension in God.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:09.080]   And to be sure, the view that I am describing has been mocked as a kind of divine schizophrenia.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.760]   I think it's better to say that God's sovereign will or his will of decree incorporates—not
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:26.160]   overrules—incorporates, includes his desires, even the ones that do not result in action.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.040]   He wills this, just like he wills what does come to pass.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   We are always prone to drag God down to the level of our own experience, since we can
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.360]   only imagine ourselves being continually frustrated in such a situation.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:51.840]   But in the mysterious infiniteness of God's complexity, that's not the case.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.800]   He's not frustrated.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.280]   I'm not sure what Ethan's second question means.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.600]   Here it is again.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:07.440]   If God's sovereignty is the foundation of his happiness, how is it possible for his
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:15.920]   will of decree to act independent of his will of desire?
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.480]   My response is, these two wills are not—never are—independent.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:34.800]   In the one unified, perfect counsel of God's wisdom, it is wise to God—it is wise—that
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:42.200]   we both desire something to happen, and will it not to happen.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:51.920]   Both of those exist harmoniously, not independently, perfect integration, perfect harmony in God's
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.040]   mysterious, perfect, infinitely complex counsel.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.560]   There's no idea here of independence of one will from the other.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.200]   So let me close with just an example, because Scripture here is so much more important than
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.040]   my effort to put it together.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.960]   One more verse that to me is provocative and pastorally incredibly helpful.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.160]   It's Lamentations 3.32 and 33.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:26.960]   Jeremiah is talking, and he's describing the sufferings of Jerusalem under siege, horrible
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.320]   suffering.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.720]   And this is what he says, "Though the Lord cause grief," so mark that, "Though the Lord
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:43.600]   cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love."
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:53.840]   And here's the amazing statement, verse 33, "For he does not afflict us from his heart,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.160]   or grieve the children of men."
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:06.360]   In other words, God is causing the grief, and it is not coming from his heart.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   Very, very interesting.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.680]   God decrees that certain things happen, which in some sense are not from his heart, that
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:26.100]   is, not his desire, which is a picture of the same divine dynamics as 1 Timothy 2.4.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:35.000]   He desires all to be saved, even though no one deserves to be saved, and yet in his freedom
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.960]   and wisdom he does not decree for all to be saved.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:49.640]   The sovereign will of God and the will of God's command, the decree and the desire,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   are in perfect harmony in the high counsels of God.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.760]   Neither is independent, neither is overruled.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:07.440]   This is just part of the mystery of what it means to be a sovereign and a loving God.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.320]   That is a fascinating passage indeed.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.240]   Again, that was Lamentations 3:32-33, if you want to look that up.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.800]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for rooting your understanding of God's sovereignty
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.720]   back time and time and time again into the text of Scripture.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.880]   So helpful.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.680]   There's no other way we can speak on these things with any authority at all apart from
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   Scripture.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   So thank you for your model.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.680]   And thank you for listening and thank you for struggling along to make sense of this
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680]   question.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.080]   I hope the answer was helpful.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.960]   You may need to listen to this episode a couple of times, and there's never any shame in that.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.160]   So thank you for listening and making this podcast a part of your week.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.040]   Three times a week we publish and you can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.400]   past episodes in our archive.

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:01.800]   Well, for a lot of us, Pastor John, you are a model and a very compelling example of a
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:07.680]   man who prays daily and who prays corporately in his local church.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.480]   So how do you structure your prayer life and how have you done it over the years?
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.360]   That's the question on the docket for you next time we meet on Wednesday.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, Pastor John, and I will see you then.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.900]   Bye.
