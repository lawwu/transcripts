[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.740]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.440]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.440]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.040]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.360]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.180]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.360]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.440]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.560]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.080]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.720]   But don't forget,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.060]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.060]   you will find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.800]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.960]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.760]   Well, listeners, welcome to this second session
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.400]   about assessment.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.680]   We had such a great time with Rachel last week,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.200]   introducing us to a new way to look at assessment
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200]   that she has come back with us today
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.160]   to give us some very practical how-tos.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.840]   If, however, you missed the last episode,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.360]   I wanna give you a teaser and set the stage
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   for what we learned together last week
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.840]   so that we can jump ahead a little farther
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920]   in our exploration of assessment.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   So last time, Rachel helped us see assessment
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.640]   as relational first,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.480]   all about considering our student
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.600]   and how he or she is growing,
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   not just how well our student finished the work, okay?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.960]   That may be a new view of assessment for some of us.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.000]   We also got a new view of assessment
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960]   as potentially restful,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.440]   a whole new idea for many of us.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   Restful assessment is all about sitting with the Lord
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.160]   as we help our student to grow.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.560]   Last time, we also recognized that assessment
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.080]   is not just about the end.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.600]   It's not something we do just at the end of the course
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.960]   or the end of a semester or the end of a year.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   Assessment is the daily process
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.520]   that helps us gauge and get in touch
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   with the up and back experience
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.680]   of growing alongside our student.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.400]   Rachel helped us see that there's a rhythm to assessment,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.800]   an ebb and a flow.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.360]   And, and this was perhaps for some of us
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.960]   the most convicting,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.320]   we learned that joyful assessment
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.720]   really rest with us.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   It's not the student,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.160]   it's not the assessing.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   If we change the way we see our job
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.000]   as parent, teacher, assessors,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.560]   if we change the way we see our children,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.120]   if we change the way we see the skills
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.560]   that we are assessing,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.880]   our assessment might become more joyful.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.520]   So that sets us up for where we find ourselves today.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.880]   The new question becomes,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.440]   how in the world do we do this?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.800]   Rachel, did you realize
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.440]   that you helped us do so many great things last time?
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.160]   - I know, I was thinking, wow,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.840]   that sounds like an episode I should go listen to.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.600]   I frequently think that when I've told somebody
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.520]   something that the Lord's placed on my heart
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320]   and they tell me what they heard.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   And I think, really, you heard that?
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.400]   Oh, that was really great.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.600]   Good going, Lord, you produced a good message.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.040]   But that's what I got
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.560]   from what you shared with us last time.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.200]   So listeners, if you missed
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   the joy of assessment, assessing joyfully last time,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   go back and pick up that episode.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.680]   I think that you will be blessed
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.160]   by getting a new view of assessment.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.800]   But here we are now, Rachel,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.640]   and the question becomes, how do we do this?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.320]   And one thing that I remember that I loved
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.280]   that you gave us last time
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.800]   was a fuller picture of what assessment really is.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.000]   That there's really, what I picked up on,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.920]   and there's probably a lot more
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.120]   and I might've missed something,
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.920]   but I picked out five things, five aspects,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.120]   five pieces of assessment of what we do
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.160]   as we are assessing our child
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.520]   and their grasp of the concept.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.840]   So knowing the information
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.520]   is absolutely part of assessment,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.320]   but then understanding the information,
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.560]   practicing well enough, often enough,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.640]   and deeply enough so that you can,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.720]   your student can articulate the information.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.440]   And then the last part of assessment
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.640]   might actually be the most important.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.160]   Where is our student's heart in all of this?
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.480]   How has what we have learned together
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.240]   changed our student's heart?
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.920]   I love all of that.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.400]   I love all of that.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.160]   And I know that for you,
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   you weren't just born knowing all of this wisdom
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.640]   about assessment.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.240]   You've had a paradigm shift toward assessment.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.560]   Talk to us about how that paradigm shift
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.520]   changed your homeschooling.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.680]   Tell us your story, Rachel.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.880]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.840]   Well, thank you again for having me today, Lisa.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.720]   I'm excited about our conversation.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   You know, my story is gonna be,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   it's like the first step is something
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   that we don't like to encounter,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.120]   but it's doing something poorly.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.040]   None of us love to do things poorly,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.920]   but in order to do something well,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.280]   you have to be willing to do it poorly first.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.760]   And so that is the same with assessment.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   As I began to learn in a different way
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.120]   and have a different mindset,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.040]   that mindset has to change, right?
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.320]   I had to walk that out in practice.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.720]   And that practice can come much easier
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   than you think it is or can, it would happen, right?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.120]   - Yeah.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.680]   - So for me, I have six children
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.920]   and assessing a 21-year-old
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.320]   is different than assessing a six-year-old, right?
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.000]   - So true.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.720]   - But you're doing it all the way across the board
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.360]   with every age.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.880]   So learning some of these skills,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   I would say one of the thing,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.080]   first pieces that I was willing to like,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.160]   okay, Lord, what do I do?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   How do I do this?
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.240]   I'd say that really resonated with me
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   was allowing your student to self-assess first, right?
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.120]   And so that takes a lot of pressure
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.640]   off of the assessor too,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.080]   is that our first goal is listening.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.960]   Anytime you're assessing,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.920]   you cannot assess well without first listening well.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.520]   - That's so good.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.400]   - How am I gonna know if there is a character issue
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.480]   or a heart issue that needs to be addressed
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   if I am not listening to my student or my child, right?
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.520]   And that is something that we have to practice.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.880]   I mean, I'll be honest, Lisa,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.520]   it's easier for me to talk than it is for me to listen.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.320]   - Oh my word, I resonate with that.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.920]   - Yes, I mean, some people are internal processors.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.720]   I'm an external processor.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.800]   And so then those thoughts just start flying
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.520]   and I, before you know it, I'm not listening.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   So practicing asking a question
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.960]   that causes your student to self-assess and listen
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.720]   is the first step of how you assess well.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.080]   - That is really good.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.920]   That is really good.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.040]   You know what, Rachel?
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.320]   I think that that is key.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.120]   I love what you said about,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.520]   it helps us to hear our student's heart.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.520]   It also helps us to hear where our child feels
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.960]   either proficient or confident
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.960]   and where they recognize some lack or some need.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.800]   - Yes.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.440]   - And it's very helpful.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.920]   Sometimes we look and we think,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.680]   oh, well, this is what you're not good at,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.200]   but that's not what the student feels unsure of.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.720]   And so we need to know what it is
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.320]   that they think they're doing well
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   and what it is that they perceive they need help with.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.360]   - Yeah, I mean, choosing to listen to your student
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.800]   actually is practicing humility.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.520]   You know, every time we pray, every time we listen,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.560]   we're actually walking out humility
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   because we often think that the master teacher,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.840]   I must know all the information mindset
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   that I was raised in,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.280]   where you as an individual learn
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.000]   that it's not okay to not know.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.840]   - Right.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.400]   - Right, and that feeling then causes us to be defensive
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.600]   and respond with, well, I do know, you know?
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   And so then, and that actually inhibits learning.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   And so changing that mindset, I think assessment,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.160]   one of the fruits of doing this kind of assessment
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.080]   is that it births humility in us as people,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.360]   as parents, as teachers,
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.280]   because when you are listening
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.240]   to how the student responds and sees themselves,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.400]   you're actually giving room for the Holy Spirit to guide you
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.280]   because you may think you know what they need to be fixed
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.560]   until they start talking, and then you're like,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.080]   oh, okay, we're going in a different direction.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.800]   - I had no idea that this was the struggle, huh?
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.760]   This is probably the primary struggle
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.320]   that this is the struggle I should worry about.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.440]   This other thing that I thought was the big deal
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   is not really that big a deal.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.760]   - Exactly, and a lot of those other things
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.560]   that are like blaring in our faces, right?
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.400]   A master teacher mindset would be,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.680]   I know what you need to do to fix
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.520]   whatever needs to be fixed.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.920]   But a classical assessor who is interested
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   in recognizing the nature of the human in front of them,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.640]   that they were made in the image of God,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.440]   and that the Holy Spirit is within them,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.760]   and that the Holy Spirit is their guide.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.160]   And our really responsibility as a parent, as a teacher,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   is to steward them learning how to know Him, right?
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.600]   Make Him known, how to hear His voice.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   And so we can do that by starting with self-assessment
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.320]   and by listening so that they can basically ask,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.640]   think, who am I?
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.240]   What did I do that was well?
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.440]   What did I not do that as well?
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   Am I seeing the situation with truth, right?
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.520]   I mean, Jesus says, "Take every thought captive."
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.400]   How many of us have had a student
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.920]   who self-assesses themselves incorrectly, right?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.760]   Like whether it be the student who said,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.640]   "Man, I can't find a single thing wrong that I've done."
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.920]   Or it be the student who's like,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.520]   "I didn't do anything right."
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.600]   I mean, I actually honestly find those students
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.400]   more often than I even do the other,
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.280]   where they just don't like what they've done,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.520]   and they can't even see the good in it.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.000]   - Yes, and that's hard.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.920]   But that is important for us to know as parents
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.240]   who love on these students, these children,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.280]   because that's a heart thing.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   That shows us where they need some building up at the heart
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.320]   before you can address any of the academic
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.880]   or otherwise assessing points.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.840]   That's really good.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.440]   - Yeah, and the thing is,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   is by asking your student to look at themselves,
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.840]   then it gives you insight while you listen
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   to know, okay, what do I need to attend to first, right?
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.120]   That's always the thing, is arrangement.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.080]   How, what is the most important thing?
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.040]   And the hardest part in assessing
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.480]   is I'm having to figure that out quickly, right?
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.560]   - Yes, while the child is standing in front of you,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.040]   waiting for your assessment.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.760]   - And there has been a moment, Lisa,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.400]   where I'm having a hard time myself,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.360]   and she's not coming to me,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.520]   and I just have to stop and say,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.880]   let's just pray for a minute.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.600]   And we're just gonna ask the Lord to give us revelation,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   to give us understanding as to what the situation,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.400]   sometimes that's what the student needs too,
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.920]   is they need to just reach out to God,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Lord, help me to see myself clearly.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.120]   - Yes, and sometimes it is okay to look at your student
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.200]   and say, well, this is going in a direction
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.440]   I didn't really see coming,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.360]   and I'm gonna need to take a minute and think about this,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.280]   can we just have our appointment in 20 minutes?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.320]   I mean, I need to sit with this for a minute,
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.880]   I didn't realize that this was your struggle,
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.440]   or I didn't realize this was your felt need,
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.080]   or I didn't realize that this was hard in this way for you,
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.800]   like I viewed the situation wrong,
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.040]   so I'm prepared to help you in a way
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.280]   that you don't see as a problem yet,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.320]   and not prepared to help you in a way
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.240]   that you are feeling stressed by.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.960]   - Right, well, and actually it can trigger things in us
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   as assessors.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.440]   - Absolutely.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.400]   - And being able to recognize that trigger and say,
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.080]   hey, let's come back to this,
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.920]   circle back in a little bit is actually wisdom, right?
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.240]   It's exercising wisdom because how many of us,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.440]   especially when it's our children,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.720]   find ourselves triggered in ways that we didn't,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.920]   we need to do some self-assessment
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.720]   and go sit before the Lord and say,
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.000]   okay, Lord, what was that?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.880]   Why did I get so angry?
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.520]   - Right. - In that moment?
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.560]   - Right, what made me defensive
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.160]   about this need in my student?
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.200]   - Right, and do I have some lies
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.760]   that need to be uncovered that I'm believing?
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   And the Lord, He is so faithful to correct the thoughts,
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.440]   to help us to see whether it is a truth or a lie.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.160]   And so whereas we are sitting before our student
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.920]   and we start with self-assessment,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.800]   I just want to encourage each of you
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.640]   that it takes a burden off of you.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.920]   When you choose to not pick up,
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.160]   like there's even a sense of codependency that can come
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   when we think we should tell what needs to be done first
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.920]   instead of self-assessment first,
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.960]   because by you're taking on a responsibility
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.600]   that's not yours is what I'm trying to say.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   Oftentimes the assessor's purpose is to facilitate
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.080]   an awakening of the soul to truth
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.040]   that the Holy Spirit wants to reveal to them.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   And if we overstep that boundary
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.200]   and choose to tell them what we think first
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.240]   before we ask them to self-assess,
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.360]   we are in a way becoming our children's Holy Spirit.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.640]   And I know that is not our heart as parents,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   but yet we find ourselves in that spot over and over.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.160]   - Right, right, I think you're right.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.440]   All of us would say,
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.280]   oh, that's absolutely what we desire above everything else,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.960]   that we would usher our students
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.160]   into the presence of the Lord
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.360]   where the Holy Spirit can reveal and deal with
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.880]   and shore them up and love on them.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   But we get so busy and so convinced
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.160]   that we have to do something
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.480]   that we try to make that happen
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.200]   instead of just make that possible.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   - Exactly, open a space for an opportunity
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.280]   for them to encounter the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.960]   And you don't have to spiritualize this.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.280]   We are human.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.200]   What I mean by that is they are body, soul, and spirit.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.920]   The spirit is always involved, always.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.080]   So you don't have to like do a formal prayer session even.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   You can just speak.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.720]   I mean, prayer is just communion to God, right?
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.400]   So even with them doing self-reflection, okay,
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.480]   if my student's not willing to do self-assessment,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.520]   that right there tells me
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.360]   the heart of where am I?
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.880]   - There's a heart issue, yeah.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.080]   - Because we don't wanna look at ourselves.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.600]   So the fact that they're willing to look at themselves
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.840]   is an act of humility on their part.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.840]   And that takes a lot of courage and it's uncomfortable.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.440]   And so being patient in that space,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.840]   offering a space for them to do that,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.560]   I cannot tell you how many times,
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.640]   like you asked for a story.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.280]   I'm thinking of a story right now.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.320]   I had my son, he came, he's 16 now,
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.080]   but this was a couple of years ago, he's 14.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.760]   And I'm sure we all know the cliches
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.440]   of 14-year-old boys, right?
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.280]   - Of course, we've heard them all.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.000]   - Who know all the things.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.160]   Mom, I know it, you don't need to tell me, right?
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.360]   - Yes, I spent years in challenge B and challenge one.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.200]   I know all of these people.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.000]   - Exactly, yes, yes, okay.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.440]   So I'm sitting down with him and he comes in
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.040]   and I start leading him through self-assessment
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.720]   of he's got a problem.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.360]   And through that self-assessment, I'm like,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.080]   well, what do you think you did well?
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.720]   And what did you, mom,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.520]   and they're so used to the assessment form.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   - They know all these shrinky questions.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.840]   - And they even can get annoyed with me, right?
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.560]   So I'll just pray with them and be like,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.240]   okay, can we just take a minute?
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.600]   'Cause if you're not willing to self-assess,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.040]   where are you, right?
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.120]   Let's just take a minute and pray.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.400]   And he did.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.520]   And then he said, okay, fine, mom, let's, okay.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.560]   - Let's do this thing.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.720]   - Yeah, let's do this thing.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.040]   So I said, okay, let's, and I just asked some questions.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.400]   And do you know, sitting there in front of me,
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.920]   my son's heart became softened.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.760]   - Yes.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.320]   - And he then brought up issues
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.240]   that I didn't even know were there,
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.400]   but the Lord dealt with them with him
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.080]   without me even having to say a thing.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.880]   And I'm sitting there going,
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.000]   oh, you're good, God, you're so good.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.560]   Like this parenting thing,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.800]   I am appreciative of being able to take some notes.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.200]   - I'm just gonna move over here to the side, yeah.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.360]   I'm just gonna sit over here
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.800]   and let you do this while I watch, yeah.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.480]   - Yes, and it was like, oh,
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.440]   it is turning upside down my role as a parent,
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.560]   let alone as a teacher and an assessor, right?
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.600]   So learning these skills in a safe place,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.240]   like with academics that feels like,
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.840]   oh, I have to do this, right?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.960]   But learning those skillsets start to like leak over
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.680]   into all the areas of your life.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.320]   - And you know what, I'm just triggered.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.960]   - Absolutely, and I just want to say
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.880]   what a great thing this is,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   what a great process it is to usher our children into
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.600]   because I was sitting here thinking,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.600]   wow, how great for them to learn to live peacefully
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.680]   with this process when they're young
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   so that it becomes their knee jerk reaction to all of life.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.820]   They are constantly thinking,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.200]   what should I be learning here?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.680]   What am I doing well?
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.840]   What is the Lord trying to show me?
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.440]   Where is the teachable moment?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.520]   And just to have a parent who is modeling that
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.360]   and walking them through that is amazing.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.600]   - Well, it's easier.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.160]   That's the thing, when he says my burden is light
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.000]   and my yoke is easy.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Lisa, it's easier to parent using this form of assessment
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   when you internally--
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.520]   - Yes, 'cause you don't have to know all the answers
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.920]   before you ask the questions.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.400]   - Exactly, and that's the key
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.200]   is that as we learn how to ask questions
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.640]   and we learn the form, right?
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.400]   Then you're able to play within that form
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.800]   and there is not a heavy burden.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   And it has been life changing for my own soul
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.320]   to learn these skill sets.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.800]   I mean, who would have thought when CeCe years ago
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.640]   would say, oh, for instance, the model or mission statement
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.320]   of classical conversations to know God
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.520]   and to make him know, right?
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.240]   That's the purpose of all of education,
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.480]   of even learning in the first place.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.120]   That resonated with me as a parent.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.880]   Yes, I want that for my kids.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.000]   - Yes.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.160]   - And so, but how do you do it?
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.520]   And then eventually, yeah, you're in a,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.600]   and someone's telling you you should learn Latin
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.880]   and you're going, this has no connection to God.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.720]   I don't understand.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   - I know, it's like, how does that relate
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.680]   to this great reason I started all this?
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.480]   - Yes, and so 20 years down the road,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.640]   I can affirmatively tell you, Lisa,
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.920]   that the form of rhetoric,
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.680]   of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.040]   of my mind being trained to think well,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.440]   speak well, and write well,
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.640]   being is, it's actually opened doors
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.560]   to my ability to commune with God
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.640]   in a way that I could not have done before.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.200]   It has walked me and ushered me into a place
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.760]   of knowing Him and being able to express
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.080]   not just a third party relationship of I know about Him,
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.480]   but I'm able to express the intimate relationship
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.320]   that I have with Him,
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   not only to my friends and peers and coworkers,
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.800]   but also to my children, right?
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.920]   These are my people that I long for them
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.080]   to know Him personally in an intimate way.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.920]   I had no idea years ago that learning how to assess
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.320]   would actually usher me into a place
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.160]   of learning how to teach my kids
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.000]   to hear His voice and know Him in a deeper way.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   And so that alone has been a surprise.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.800]   It's like, yeah, that's what I wanted so long ago.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.080]   And I want to encourage everyone,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.560]   the how-to process is actually very easy.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.160]   It starts with humility.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.240]   It starts with self-assessment,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.560]   but then what happens in listening on our part, right?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.840]   It definitely needs to include
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.840]   an actual verbal invitation to the Lord to reveal, right?
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   Reveal truth to us, God,
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.280]   even if it's not some formal prayer, just a statement.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.400]   Lord, help.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.240]   How many of us have been in those moments?
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.840]   Help, please. - Yes, help me Lord.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.920]   - So He will.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.080]   He's faithful to do that.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.880]   And then what we need to do is to learn in that listening.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.440]   We ask, I mean, I've actually even done this internally.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.640]   I'm listening going, okay, Lord,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.240]   what is it that you want me to attend to, right?
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.480]   So I'm inviting Him into the process
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.400]   of me giving feedback to my student.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.200]   Did they assess themselves correctly, number one?
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.880]   And then number two, if they didn't see it themselves,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.440]   chances are they're not ready for it.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.960]   - Right. - That's a clue to us.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.320]   Do my students understand and know?
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.280]   If they don't know, they didn't see it,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.960]   then it's either maybe they're not emotionally ready for it
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   or maybe they think that they don't need it.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.920]   If we don't think we need help in something,
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.600]   we're not pretty much prone to accept help
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.400]   'cause we already got it, right?
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.680]   - Exactly.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.160]   - That pride can rise up in an individual.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   So it makes me think of the story of David in the Bible.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.760]   And David has the prophet, what was his name?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.440]   - Nathan. - Nathan, I think, yes.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.520]   Okay, Nathan comes into him
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.280]   and he is going, led by the Lord to rebuke him
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.880]   for the sin of stealing another man's wife
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.120]   and of sexual immorality and murder.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.840]   Now these are pretty big things to have to self-assess.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.720]   - Yes, but he starts by telling him a story about sheep.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.480]   - Exactly, right.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.440]   Which telling him a story about sheep,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.000]   that's a little less triggering, wouldn't you say?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.320]   - Yes, yes, I mean, I could easily see the king thinking,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.560]   well, this doesn't really have anything to do with me
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.200]   so I'm not on my guard.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.280]   I don't have my shield up.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.480]   Nobody's attacking me.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.680]   This is not about me.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.080]   It's about a shepherd.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.480]   - And you better believe that David was defensive
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.000]   right out the door as Nathan walked in.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.200]   I mean, prophets don't come and visit kings.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.160]   - Right, I know you're coming to smack my hand.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.000]   - Exactly, and he knows he sinned, right?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.080]   So he's expecting some kind of smack.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.880]   So to have a invitation, that's what happened
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.920]   is that Nathan invited him into a conversation
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.400]   to contemplate truths
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.960]   in a third objective, third party view.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.840]   And that invitation was received.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   So that reception right off the bat tells Nathan,
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.920]   okay, he's interested in having a conversation.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.680]   And maybe even just having the conversation
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.840]   is helping him to, the Lord is softening his heart, right?
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.560]   'Cause maybe he has a will, he could have chosen no,
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.480]   but he said yes, so his heart is being softened.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.440]   And then Nathan tells him a story.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.680]   Do you remember the story?
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.800]   You have to tell me. - I do.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.040]   - Okay, tell me the story.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   - Well, he tells him about a man who has a lot of sheep.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.800]   He tells him, and the bottom line is that
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.600]   he says, and this guy who had everything
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   went after the belongings of a much poorer man.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:57.360]   And what do you think should be done?
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.480]   - Right, and what does David, how does he respond?
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.280]   - Oh, this guy was way out, way off.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.440]   He should be punished.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.080]   He has done a despicable thing.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.480]   And who is this guy?
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.440]   And I will fix this situation.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.840]   - Right. - And Nathan is like,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.040]   hey, guess what?
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.080]   - You, you are that guy. - You're the one.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.400]   - You're the one. - Right?
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.120]   Now, what if David had responded with,
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.440]   I don't see the problem, what's wrong with that?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.840]   - Right, or this is, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.040]   Then I guess that Nathan would know
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   that David was not, his heart was not ready
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.000]   to receive truth, that he was not able to judge justly
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.760]   even in this situation.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.080]   - Right, and I mean, and as a king,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.000]   we see in history tells us there's lots of kings
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.480]   who did not know how to judge justly, right?
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.320]   And so here is David.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   If he didn't respond in a way that he understood justice,
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.840]   then it could be, it's not that he's evil,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.880]   it could be that he's had poor training
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.720]   that needs to be corrected, right?
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   And Nathan would have to identify that.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.760]   It could be that he doesn't care about justice.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   And even though he has been taught correctly,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.920]   he doesn't care.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.200]   - Or that he's gotten all involved in situational ethics.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.560]   You know, well, this is not as bad in this situation
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.800]   or it's not as bad as this other thing.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.960]   - Right, right.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.840]   And so Nathan's having to assess that.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.520]   Now, the thing is, is Nathan had relationship with David.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.680]   This was not a first encounter.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.280]   So that plays a part in how we can assess.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.360]   If we know someone better, like our children,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.960]   we're able to see very quickly patterns in their life
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.760]   of other spaces that the Lord will bring up
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.360]   to help connect the dots
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.840]   as to what the truth may be in that situation.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.120]   But if it's somebody that you don't know,
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.280]   you might have to ask more questions.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.040]   But in this case, Nathan had a relationship with him.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.360]   He had invited him and David had accepted the invitation.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.760]   He presented an objective, you know, a third party,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.600]   what's the word?
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.040]   Objective story to help him to see a truth
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.160]   so that by the time he then turned it to,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.080]   well, David, you are that man.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.920]   It caused him to come to a place of repentance.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.120]   - Yes.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.200]   - And that repentance is huge.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   - He was able to see himself standing against the truth
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.080]   he really believed.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.280]   He was finally able to see himself in his actions
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.160]   as opposed to what he held to in his heart.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.920]   And he found himself apart from God.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.040]   - Exactly.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.400]   And so what it did was what repentance always does,
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.040]   it drives us to the feet of our creator.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   And he went and he repented,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.000]   received the message as to what he needed to do.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.440]   And that encounter is the kind of encounters
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.920]   that I experienced with all of my people all the time.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.880]   Because when, now let me rephrase that,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.240]   when I practice these tools, Lisa,
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.680]   there are still times that I find myself
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.920]   telling my students, my children,
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.360]   what I think before I walk them into self-assessment.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.920]   And I'm telling you, it does not get the same results
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   as when I practice and employ these skills of assessment.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.120]   It is first and foremost relational,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.280]   but it is conversational.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.600]   And if you need to know more information,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   you ask more questions.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.200]   And recognizing that when any time that we're assessing,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.280]   we're always considering the content that we're assessing
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.720]   in tension with the student, in tension with ourselves.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.040]   And of course that makes us think of triangles, right?
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.160]   - Right.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.480]   - And that triangle of that perfect tension,
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.760]   it's not accidental that the triangle
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.080]   is a symbol of the Trinity of God.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.920]   - Yes.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.480]   - And inviting him into this process,
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.800]   he made us be in communion,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.160]   not only with him, but with each other.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.840]   And our relationship in communion with each other
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.480]   actually facilitates and drives us
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.920]   to our relationship with him,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.160]   which is what you saw with David, right?
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   And so I'm just thinking,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.080]   okay, Lord, what's the next step then in assessment?
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.960]   How do we do this thing?
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.080]   - Yes, because I love the groundwork that you've laid
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.120]   that helps us see the content,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.200]   which is what most of us start with when we think,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.880]   okay, it was time to do assessment.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.640]   Oh, it's the end of the semester, it's the end of the year,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.680]   or I have to give somebody a grade for something.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.400]   We start with the content,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.120]   but what you're helping us see
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.320]   is that the content is always intention
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.160]   with the relationship that the student has to the Lord
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.480]   that has to us.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.520]   So once we recognize that, what do we do?
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.040]   Where do we go next?
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.080]   - Yes, so after we've walked our student
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.040]   through self-assessment and we've invited God in
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.040]   to asking for arrangement help as to what to address,
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.840]   I always piggyback off of what the student sees,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.440]   what they see in themselves,
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.400]   if they've judged themselves correctly, right?
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.280]   So there are times that you have a student
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.000]   where I'll throw some bonus pieces in is how I call it.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.160]   Maybe they didn't see it,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.680]   but I can tell that they're hungry for more,
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.160]   and that hunger is an invitation to me
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.280]   to be able to add one or two more things,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.200]   but understanding that assessment is,
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.680]   there's lots of kinds of assessment.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.360]   So what I just described to you as a step-by-step process,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.600]   or what that we're in the middle of
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.840]   is one kind of assessment to bless.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.080]   There are other kinds, like in my class that I teach online,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.160]   I actually focus on a different style of assessment,
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.800]   which helps us to identify the sum total
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.280]   of what we would know on any given subject.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.440]   And that helps us to understand,
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.800]   not necessarily the information,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   but on the skill sets that they possess or do not possess.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.880]   So I think that's one piece of classical assessment
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.400]   that is different than a modern style of assessment
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.760]   is that we're focused on skill sets.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.920]   - Yes, good. - Not just piles
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.600]   of information.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.120]   - And that is something that's different for us,
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.240]   'cause most of us who were presumably educated
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.080]   under the modern education system
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.720]   were totally assessed on information.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.200]   What we know, what we can show, what we can solve,
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   what we can prove, and not on the skills of listening
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.600]   or logical thinking or articulation or beauty,
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.560]   the skill of knowing how to use something beautiful.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.400]   Yes, attending to things, noticing pieces
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.040]   and how they fit together.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:48.960]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.280]   That's very much a classical difference.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.320]   - And it actually frees us,
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.240]   because if we have like a checklist of a hundred items
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.560]   and the student was able to acquire a skill
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.880]   in only 20 of those items that need to be checked off,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.160]   then guess what?
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.800]   You're freed from those other 80 items,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.720]   because the purpose is to learn things
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.520]   in order to acquire skills.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.440]   I had a mom who told me years ago
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.200]   when I was first getting started,
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.880]   maybe only like three or four years
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.760]   into my own homeschooling journey with my kids,
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.000]   and she goes, "Rachel, you know you can't teach your kids
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.880]   "everything that they need to know, right?"
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.640]   - Right, there's always gonna be something you don't know
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.560]   or you don't get to.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   - Right, well, I honestly was like stuck when she said that,
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.120]   because I did believe that I was responsible
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.200]   for teaching them everything they should know.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.160]   - Right, right.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:52.080]   - And I didn't even know that I had that burden on me.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.880]   And so for her saying that to me helped me go,
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:00.240]   "Oh, okay, well then what is my purpose?
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.400]   "What am I supposed to be doing?"
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   Right, and so this learning how to teach skills,
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.000]   and that we are giving them skills
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.440]   that then the Lord continues that process
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.400]   of giving them what they need to know as they age,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.280]   and other people in their lives,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.120]   whether it be universities or mentors in their life, right,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.760]   that come alongside them and guide them,
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.240]   then take over that responsibility of skill sets.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.160]   That is freeing, Lisa, that is so freeing.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.800]   - Well, and it is so much more successful
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.640]   if we will spend the time we have with our children
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.880]   preparing them to be learners,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.760]   giving them the skills of learning,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.200]   then they are prepared to learn whenever and wherever
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.600]   God drops in a lesson or a teacher.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.720]   We have cultivated the soil
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.320]   so that it can actually receive a seed
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.200]   and produce a plant with fruit.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.640]   - Exactly, and so then what happens
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.320]   is that by the time you're talking about
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   something like a transcript,
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.680]   a transcript becomes minor.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.120]   It's just a snapshot of their story.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.360]   It's just a little picture, right?
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.480]   When you have a picture of a child
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.640]   that you post like your Christmas photo,
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.760]   that doesn't tell your whole story of your family,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.920]   but it is just a quick view of an idea,
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.680]   a caricature of who they are,
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.640]   and that's what the transcript is.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   And so when we learn that we are assessing on skills
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.000]   and not content,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.680]   then that also frees us of the burden of the transcript
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.600]   that we grade in a different kind of way
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.960]   than what a modern educator
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.880]   might see the transcript as or grade by.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.040]   And we don't fit in the same rules, if you will.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.720]   We have to play by the same rules.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.320]   - Yes, and I just wanna say at this point, you guys,
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.480]   we are gonna have one more session with Rachel
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.080]   where she is going to take us through the transcript
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.240]   and how to build that snapshot,
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.400]   make our peace with the fact that it's a snapshot,
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.760]   but how do we produce that snapshot
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.960]   that will tell an accurate story to people
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.360]   who may be not looking at assessment
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.160]   in the same way that we have
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.320]   when we are producing a transcript for other people
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   to use in other contexts.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.600]   So we're gonna talk about that next time.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.440]   So I just wanna use that as a teaser, Rachel.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.760]   - I love it, I love it.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.960]   - That is just great.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.000]   - Yes, are there any other specific questions
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.880]   that you have for me today?
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.480]   - Well, I was gonna say,
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   you have given us a whole lot of better reasons,
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.520]   better purposes for assessment,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.520]   and you have given us something that I know
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.280]   is the real practical starting out step,
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.920]   the asking the question,
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.040]   asking the Lord to take control,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.280]   listening to our student
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.320]   and listening to not just what they say,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.960]   but where their heart is,
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.440]   how what they say pulls back the curtain
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.600]   on where their heart is
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.280]   and what they're ready to hear.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   And then I absolutely resonate
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.720]   with your classical emphasis
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.120]   and reminder to us that we are assessing skills,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.200]   and that is more important.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.320]   It's different than,
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.160]   and also more important than just assessing information
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.360]   that our children may have accumulated.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.640]   Are there any other stages of assessment?
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.280]   I know that you alluded at the beginning
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.600]   when you're talking about your family,
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.880]   that there are different ways to assess children
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.160]   at different stages of their development.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.280]   I mean, you can't really ask,
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.960]   if you're assessing your first grader,
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.760]   you don't necessarily put as much stock in.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.960]   Well, what do you think you did well this year?
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.920]   Because they don't know
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.760]   what they are supposed to be doing.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.480]   Are there some tips that,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.240]   or are there different things you use
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.400]   to assess students of different ages/stages?
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.080]   - Well, that's a really good question.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.640]   And I think that the form actually stays the same,
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.520]   but it's truncated for small children.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.520]   - That's exactly what I'm going for.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.760]   Practical help for people who are thinking,
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.400]   but I have a six-year-old, and I have a 10-year-old,
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.960]   and I have a 14-year-old, and I have a 17-year-old.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.560]   - Right, yes.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.600]   - How do I shuffle those?
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.720]   - Absolutely. - That process, okay.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.600]   - Yep, so the themes,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.160]   it's kind of like makes me think of jazz music, right?
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.000]   - Ooh.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.960]   - Jazz music is actually a very complex form.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.760]   And a lot of times you'll hear the word impromptu
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.280]   in regards to jazz music,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.240]   but people think that they just make up stuff, right?
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.080]   Well, actually, the truth is that there is a theme,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.280]   a melody, and there are forms
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.080]   that they have to have had learned first as a musician,
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.640]   and then they are able to have freedom within those forms.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.660]   And the same plays out for a parent.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.000]   When you learn the forms of assessment,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.480]   and you learn the forms of learning,
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.280]   then when I'm applying them to a six-year-old,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.080]   I'm able to play with it, if you will.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.940]   And I almost like, you know how Darth Vader would walk in,
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.720]   and every time he walks in in "Star Wars,"
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   his theme music starts to play?
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.160]   - Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.240]   - So you're gonna start having theme music
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.520]   changing to each kid.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.880]   You're gonna, things that the Lord is highlighting to you
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.640]   that needs to be addressed,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.880]   certain skills that start to play over and over again
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.280]   when I encounter a student.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.080]   You know, we've all been there even just in parenting.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.440]   Oh, like Mrs. Pigglewiggle books, right?
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   There's these little issues that have to be addressed
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.080]   in a particular kid.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.280]   Now, I mean, if you love Mrs. Pigglewiggle,
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.240]   I've always thought of God as Mrs. Pigglewiggle in a way
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   that he has every specific potion and cure
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.360]   for every kid in the whole world.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.840]   So he does that to, he'll teach me
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.640]   through the self-assessment and walking,
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.740]   even my six-year-old.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.440]   So I had my daughter, my youngest,
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.280]   she came in and I was sitting in a chair,
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.320]   drinking my coffee.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.360]   And you know, sometimes, I will be honest,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.760]   I love it when she snuggles,
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.960]   and then there are other times that I'm like,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.920]   "Wow, you're interrupting my moment."
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.760]   (laughs)
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.400]   - With my mom, my time.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.200]   - Yeah, which is, you know, an interesting thing,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.640]   'cause it could be that I have to assess in that moment
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.140]   that the Lord wants to teach me something about patience
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.440]   and how this interruption is actually,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.600]   it is the parts of parenting, exactly.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.760]   And so this one particular day,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.280]   she came into my lap and I was praying
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.360]   and she's like, "What are you doing?"
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.160]   And I'm like, "Oh, I'm asking Jesus
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.280]   if there's anybody that I need to forgive."
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.720]   And she goes, "I wanna pray too."
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.680]   And I go, "Oh, okay, well, let's ask Jesus."
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.520]   So we did.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.440]   I was able to walk her through hearing and listening
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.200]   to whom the Lord thinks that she needs to forgive.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.000]   Well, then it ended up being this beautiful,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.880]   like three minute interaction
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.960]   of her forgiving her sister over something.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.760]   And what I learned from that moment is,
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.440]   I was listening, the Lord was highlighting, right?
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.080]   Something needed to be addressed.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.240]   He, and her attentiveness as a six-year-old
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.440]   to want to pray, that tells me something right away, right?
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.760]   That this, okay. - Yes, yes.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.000]   That God has softened her heart.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.840]   - Exactly, 'cause I didn't ask her.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.660]   - The Holy Spirit has made her ready.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.480]   - Uh-huh, exactly, exactly, Lisa.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.960]   He led her to me.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.000]   Now he's asking for me to facilitate a space.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.080]   And so as a six-year-old,
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.400]   I have to ask questions the same that I ask.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.880]   Now, if it's a 16-year-old,
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.800]   I can ask different kinds of questions.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.960]   I can probe a little bit deeper.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.320]   My six-year-old only has like a five minute attention span.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.880]   - Right. - That, you know,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.920]   compare, and honestly,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.720]   my 16-year-old only has slightly more, let's be honest.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.320]   (both laughing)
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.960]   So, so I have to change
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   based on what they're, how they're responding to me.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.840]   The other thing that I would encourage you
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.360]   is in building relationship.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.840]   Because even though a six-year-old,
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.640]   we recognize, okay, I build relationship with this child
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.760]   by reading to them, and doing, and like baking,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   and doing all the fun things
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   that we like can be prompted to do.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.720]   But a 16-year-old needs the same kind
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.000]   of relational equity, if you will.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.040]   - Yes, yes. - As a six-year-old.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.200]   So I need to schedule in one-on-one time every week
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.880]   with that kid, and I have six kids.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.000]   And Lisa, I have to be intentional.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.040]   - Yes, or it doesn't happen. - I mean, I have to do,
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.720]   yeah, like I have to assign a day to each kid.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.120]   That that is your day,
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.000]   and I spend one hour on their day with them.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.080]   Is it beautiful and exact every week?
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.840]   Not at all.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.680]   - Right, right. - But it becomes
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.440]   a part of our culture.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.280]   Like going to church. - It becomes
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.200]   a part of your rhythm.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.160]   It's the rhythm of your family that this happens.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.000]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.400]   You have to schedule intentional time
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   to have conversation, and assessment is no different.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.560]   So if I want to assess all of my children,
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.160]   I have to intentionally schedule space
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.120]   and opportunities for assessment.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.080]   And then sometimes I have to motivate myself to get there.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.560]   - Yeah, yes. - You know, like
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   with a good cup of coffee, a piece of dark chocolate,
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.680]   some, you know, a reward afterwards.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.560]   Sometimes I do have to have those motivators
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.320]   just to make it happen. - Well, 'cause sometimes
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.880]   you know it's gonna be a hard conversation.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.360]   - Yeah, yeah. - Or it's gonna be
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.920]   uncomfortable before it's comfortable.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.040]   And that can be difficult.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:02.880]   - Yeah. - That can be
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.920]   very difficult.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.960]   - It can, it can.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   And so it does look, it does feel and look different
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.800]   to assess the different ages.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.200]   But you know how I started off,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.240]   I'm gonna circle back to the very first thing
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.520]   that I said, was that you have to be willing
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.400]   to do things poorly to begin with.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:28.400]   And so here I'm encouraging you just to take a step
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.800]   to do it poorly, to schedule time in your life,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.120]   to have a rhythm for assessment,
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:40.000]   to ask good questions, and to practice it.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.360]   And when you choose to intentionally practice these forms
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.240]   with your family, what happens is you internalize them.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.960]   And before you know it,
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.680]   it comes out in spaces you didn't schedule.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.800]   - Yes. - It naturally flows
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.880]   through your parenting and your interaction with people,
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.800]   not only with my children, but with my spouse
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.400]   and with my peers.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   We learn how to invite, to offer hospitality,
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   to be kind to our children,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.960]   the same way we're kind to other people.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.540]   How many of us have said that?
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.520]   Where it's like to your children, you're like,
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.560]   you need to treat your siblings better
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.520]   than you treat other people 'cause it's harder.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.480]   And if you can do it with these people,
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.440]   you'll be able to do it with everybody else, right?
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.600]   - That's very true. - And so the same
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.240]   is with parenting.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.400]   I have to learn how to treat my children just as good
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.240]   as I'm treating you here, Lisa, on this podcast.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.120]   And setting aside space and learning these forms
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   will actually help me to practice hospitality and kindness
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.560]   with the people who mean the most in my life.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.640]   - Oh, wow.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   And that makes me eager to practice assessing
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.320]   because I really do want to love my family better.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   I really do want us to have a richer relationship.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.400]   I really do want us to be comfortable helping one another
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.120]   to grow in the Lord and toward the Lord.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.000]   And as he wants us each to grow,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I would love to learn to help one another
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.360]   draw closer to the Lord.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.680]   And that's what assessment can be.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.240]   And I appreciate so much, Rachel,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   you spending this time helping us
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.760]   to get a new view of assessment
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.480]   or maybe a better handle on it,
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   or at least permission to begin a new way of assessing
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.720]   that is a blessing to our whole family.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.840]   Thank you so much.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.280]   I also want to ask you,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.000]   well, I want to give a promo to the next segment
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.960]   that we're going to do, which is about transcripts.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.680]   And I want to give you a chance to talk to our listeners
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.280]   about another offering you have
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.520]   for folks who want to know more about assessing
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.320]   or maybe more about transcripts.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   Tell us about the classes you have coming up.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.600]   Thank you for this opportunity.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.440]   - Yeah.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.720]   - So, well, you can check us out
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.920]   at classicaltoolsforchange.com
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.600]   and that's for the number four.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.760]   And we have a couple of conferences coming up
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.680]   that there's a six hour conference
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.520]   that really helps us to practice together
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.760]   the skills of assessment.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.320]   Not only do we go through a lot
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.200]   of these great conversations of ideas in the first part,
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.000]   but we practice the skills of assessment.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.160]   I model it for you and you get to then practice.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.760]   Now that kind of assessment we do in my class
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   or this conference is focused on being able
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.480]   to take that information and apply it to a transcript.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.600]   Because the third part,
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.080]   then we're going through the logistics
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.840]   of crafting a transcript.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.680]   - Yes.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.880]   - And the conferences are kept small
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.640]   with a maximum of 12 students.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.920]   And so we have a next one coming up
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.240]   is February 13th, 18th and 20th
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.680]   at 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.520]   Yes.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   But maybe you're not ready to join on to that conference.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.480]   I do have a free class that I'm offering,
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.440]   a one hour class that's gonna be February 1st
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.800]   at 11 a.m. Central Standard Time.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.520]   So I guess that's noon Eastern Standard Time.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.360]   - Gotcha.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.960]   - And that is gonna be,
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.480]   the registration for that will be on our website,
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.200]   Classical Tools for Change on Facebook.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.920]   Our website, you can connect to me directly,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.880]   Rachel Moriarty and I can give you the information as well.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.640]   I'm on all the social media interests.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.880]   We have a page, Tools for Transcripts on Facebook as well.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.520]   It'll be posted there.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.640]   And that one hour class,
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.560]   I expand to 30 registrations.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.920]   But we cut it off at 30.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.720]   And that is a different purpose.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.800]   Whereas in our online conference,
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.160]   we're learning how to do the thing.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.760]   This free class, we're focusing on
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.040]   what is a transcript really?
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.440]   And I know we're gonna talk about that
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.800]   some more next visit with each other.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.280]   But I wanted to be able to help people to see
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.880]   and walk them through a process of understanding
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.320]   its function and purpose within that form of assessing.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.120]   And so we can, the dates again,
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.480]   are February 13th, 18th and 20th
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.120]   for our next live conference.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.920]   - And that's a three part thing, right?
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   - That's a three part class.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.000]   - You come to all three of those days,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.760]   not one of those days, yes.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.160]   - Exactly, that's a full six hour,
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.040]   but we only meet two hours each time
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.440]   for three meetings in order to practice
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   and get to know one another,
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.440]   answer all your questions, all of those things.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.640]   And then the free class, one hour,
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.040]   I will have an also an opportunity
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.640]   for questions and answers of just those,
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.840]   I love they're called burning questions, right?
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.000]   The thing that you're just like,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.560]   I've got to attend to this in order to hear.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.120]   And so we can organize private events
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.720]   for your local community as well.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.200]   So you can enjoy the conversations with your friends.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.080]   But to just, if you want some more information
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.480]   or to register for any of these,
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.560]   just visit us at classicaltoolsforchange.com.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.800]   - Oh, Rachel, that's so good.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.760]   Thank you for offering to share with us
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.640]   what the Lord has revealed to you
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.280]   and what has changed your homeschooling experience.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.080]   I appreciate you so much.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.920]   And I'm already looking forward to our next conversation,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.480]   which you guys will be about transcripts
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.520]   and how to see the transcript as a snapshot
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.200]   of your homeschool experience.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.720]   All right, see you guys next time.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.960]   Rachel, again, thanks.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.040]   - All right, thank you.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.400]   - All right, bye-bye.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.800]   (soft music)
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.860]   you
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
