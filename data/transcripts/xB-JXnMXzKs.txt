[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.780]   - This week we are talking with speaker and author
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.660]   Paul Tripp.
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.540]   Paul is the author of a really helpful book
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.820]   titled Sex and Money.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.440]   And Paul, one of the themes throughout the book
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.340]   that you make, and it's an important one,
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.020]   is that sexuality is never secular.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.980]   Sex is always spiritual.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.660]   Sex is always worship.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.940]   Explain this dynamic for us.
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.140]   - Well, in order to understand the worship nature of sex,
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.880]   again, you have to go back to how we were constructed.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.480]   Worship is not first an activity.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.160]   You know, many Christians, when they hear the word worship,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.120]   they hear Sunday morning, a service, a gathering,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.420]   or if it's a real cool church, Saturday night.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.040]   What's important to understand is that worship
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.040]   is first my identity before it's ever my activity.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.040]   I don't just worship on Sunday.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.800]   I really worship my way through every moment of every day,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.780]   every situation, every location,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.600]   every relationship involves worship.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840]   I mean, you could argue that if you took apart
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.440]   the motivation of human beings,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.120]   the only thing we ever do is worship.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.160]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   It means that something is always Lord over my heart.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.840]   Something is always controlling my heart,
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.400]   the heart being the seat of my thoughts,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.000]   the seat of my emotions,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.920]   the seat of my will and my choices.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.200]   So it's the control center of my humanness.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   So it's impossible for my life not to be ruled by worship.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.920]   For example, the words that I say to the people in my life
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.760]   are controlled by what I'm worshiping.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.600]   Think about this.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960]   If I'm worshiping pleasure
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.080]   and you're in the way of my pleasure,
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.480]   I'm going to say angry words to you.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.840]   But if I'm worshiping God
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.880]   and you're in the way of my pleasure,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.720]   I'm going to be patient, kind, and forgiving to you.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.660]   I mean, that's the difference.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.660]   And so it's impossible for me to take off my worship nature
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.800]   when I'm pursuing human sexuality.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520]   It's structured by what I'm worshiping.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.240]   Now, let's be practical.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.080]   If I'm worshiping myself,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.780]   I'll use you for my pleasure and I'll hurt you.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.720]   If I'm worshiping sex, I'll deny boundaries
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.140]   and go wherever sexual pleasure leads me.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.480]   If I'm worshiping the other person,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.340]   I'll try to find satisfaction in that person
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.960]   that I'm never able to find and hurt them and hurt me.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.760]   If I'm worshiping God,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.160]   then I'm going to love the boundaries he set for me
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.400]   and I'm going to love my neighbor as myself
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.800]   and sex will live the way it's supposed to live.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.540]   - That's good.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.620]   So what would you say to an unmarried couple
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.620]   who is presently living together?
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.320]   - This will sound harsh at first, but let me explain.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.580]   I would say, "God's smarter than you."
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.760]   And when you say, "No, I'm not going to stand
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.800]   "inside of God's boundaries,"
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.640]   you're actually saying,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.000]   "I know more about me and this thing than God."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Now, God knows that sex is only safe
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.160]   in the context of a long-term committed relationship
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.700]   between a man and a woman called marriage.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.280]   Now, there may be mysteries to that
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.240]   that I'll never understand,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.880]   but I submit myself to that
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   because I understand God as creator knows me,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.880]   God as creator knows sex,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.800]   and he knows that it's best expressed,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.880]   it's best beautified and protected
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.840]   and made holy inside of these boundaries.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.760]   What right, how arrogant would it be for me
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.380]   to say, "No, I know better."
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.100]   - Yes, amen, thank you, Paul.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.620]   That's Paul Tripp, the author of the book, "Sex and Money."
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.140]   It's a very, very helpful book.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.580]   You should check it out.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.260]   And you can get everything you wanna know
