[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320]   [The Lord God Almighty and ever blessed God, we continue in thy holy presence and we come
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.680]   O God in order that we may continue to thank thee and to bless and praise thy name for
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.480]   all thy wondrous goodness and kindness and mercy and compassion with respect to us. O
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.040]   Lord, we realize that we are creatures belonging thus to time and passing through this world
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.920]   and we think of our existence according to these human measures and standards. And so
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.260]   O God we come this morning which to us is the beginning of a new year. We realize that
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:01.080]   thou art outside time from eternity to eternity and we realize that thou hast put eternity
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:10.120]   into our hearts. But so O God we come and we thank thee that even as we look at these
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.160]   things from the standpoint of our own measures and assessments we have everything O Lord
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.720]   for which to thank thee and so we come before thee. And as we have already acknowledged
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.400]   O God we would acknowledge again that thou hast looked upon us and blessed us. We thank
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.120]   thee that looking back we can say that surely goodness and mercy have followed us all the
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.440]   days of our life. O God we thank thee for that, that we are more certain of that than
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   we are of any other single fact. For we know that we are now in thy presence and concerned
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   to seek thy face because of that. We realize that we are what we are by thy grace and that
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.060]   we are concerned about our souls and their relationship to thee because thou hast looked
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.960]   upon us, because thou hast drawn us with the cords of thy love, because thou hast worked
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.100]   in us by thy Holy Spirit. O God we know that were it not for thy goodness and for thy mercy
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.520]   and for thy compassion and longsuffering we would have been left to ourselves and as we
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.480]   were in sin and in the death of sin. O God we therefore do indeed thank thee and lift
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.660]   up our hearts together to praise thy great and wondrous name. We cannot understand thy
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.160]   love O God, and above everything else we find it difficult to understand thy patience, for
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.560]   we have so often failed thee. We have so often broken our own vows and pledges. We have failed
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.380]   so frequently to come up even to our own standard and have failed to do that which we intended
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.120]   to do. And O God, it would not surprise us if thou hadst finished with us and turned
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.080]   thy back upon us often times. But we know that thou hast mercy and compassion and thou
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.840]   hast been longsuffering with respect to us. Thou hast waited for us, thou hast varied
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.640]   thy methods of dealing with us in order to call us and to draw us unto thyself. And O
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.440]   Lord, we feel we can but come before thee and present ourselves in a humble acknowledgement
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   of our partial realization of the greatness of thy love with respect to us. Here I raise
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:54.760]   mine Ebenezer, hither by thine help I am come. O Lord, we realize that that is the truth
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.840]   about us all. Thou hast held us, thou hast sustained us, thou hast given us that which
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.180]   we needed exactly and precisely at every moment. So looking back, O God, across our lives and
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.320]   across this past year, we do indeed thank thee for all things, for we know that all
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.720]   things work together for good to them that love God. O Lord, we would thank thee for
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.280]   chastisement even. We would thank thee for things that at the time we couldn't understand
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.520]   and at which we were tempted to grumble and to complain. We thank thee, O God, that when
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.160]   we look at these things in the light of our destiny and thy great and gracious purpose
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.440]   for us, we see how even these things have ministered to our good, have made us look
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.840]   at ourselves and realize what we are apart from thy grace, and then have enabled us to
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.880]   see in a new and in a wondrous manner the exceeding riches of thy grace and the endlessness
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.520]   of the ocean of thy love with respect to us. O God, we therefore do desire to thank thee.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.800]   We thank thee for everything that thou hast enabled us to see of the truth concerning
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   thyself in Christ Jesus. We thank thee, O God, for a larger and a deeper apprehension
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.480]   of this wondrous plan of redemption and of salvation. We thank thee, O God, for bringing
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.280]   us to see more and more that it is something which is eternal, something that was worked
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   out and elaborated even before the very foundation of the world itself, something which goes
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.680]   on until sin and evil shall finally be destroyed, and everything in heaven and earth and under
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   the earth shall acknowledge the lordship and the name of thy dear Son. O God, we thank
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.160]   thee for this larger view of redemption, this ability to see it not only in terms of what
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:09.640]   thou hast graciously enabled us to enjoy, but in terms also of that larger purpose,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:17.960]   in terms of the glory of thy great and holy name and the glory of thy dear Son. O God,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.560]   we thank thee for this, and we thank thee for every fresh understanding that thou hast
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:32.160]   given us of our utter inability to do anything finally of value in the salvation of our own
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.520]   souls, so that we see that we are entirely debtors to thee and to thy mercy and to that
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   alone. O God, we therefore pray that thou wouldst continue thy gracious dealings with
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.960]   us. Wilt thou by thy Spirit enable us more and more to understand thy word and to apply
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.480]   it unto ourselves, to see its relevance to the whole of our lives individually and to
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.200]   the whole condition of men and the state of the entire world. O we thank thee for thy
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.920]   word. We thank thee for this gracious revelation of thy purposes. We thank thee, O Lord, that
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.000]   we are in it and that we see ourselves as participators in this tremendous purpose.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.960]   O enable us, we pray thee, then more and more to set our affections on these things and
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:34.880]   to wean ourselves and all our pulses from this present evil world. O God, we do therefore
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.400]   praise thy name as we look back and realize that thou hast called us and that thou hast
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.520]   dealt with us, that thou art working out thy great purpose in us, and we would pray thee,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.680]   O God, that thou wouldst continue with these gracious dealings with us, that we more and
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.000]   more may approximate unto the image and the pattern of him whom thou hast set forth before
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.160]   us. O therefore, we submit ourselves to thee together this morning. Our desire is, O God,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:15.040]   to know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. O Lord, wilt thou graciously
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.520]   manifest thyself to us? Enable us, O God, to do that which thou wouldst have us do to
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:30.480]   that end. And O we beseech thee, grant unto us such glimpses of thy glory and of thy grace
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.680]   that everything else shall take its right place in our lives and everything shall have
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:44.040]   its own significance and no more. O God, we pray thee, so to fill us and so to shed thy
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:50.840]   love abroad in our hearts that everything small and unworthy and mean and which belongs
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:57.400]   only to time and to earth shall be driven and swept out of our lives and we shall be
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:04.960]   filled with this new life according to the image and pattern of thy dear Son, our blessed
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.880]   Lord and Saviour. Lord God, we therefore would offer ourselves to thee anew and afresh. We
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:19.600]   do submit ourselves and dedicate ourselves once more. O God, we pray thee to take us
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.360]   and to send down thine own holy fire in the Holy Spirit to consume the offering that the
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:34.320]   incense of it may arise in thy presence and be pleasing and acceptable in thy holy sight.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.920]   Lord, hear us as thus we pray and hear us as in any special manner we do pray thy continued
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   and increasing blessing upon thy church here and everywhere throughout the world. O God,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:56.520]   it grieves us thou knowest our hearts. It grieves us to see thy name forgotten, derided
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:04.600]   often times by men. O God, it grieves us to see the godlessness and the irreligion rampant
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   in this city and in this country and throughout the world. O God, we pray thee that thou wouldest
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.520]   so fill thy church and thy people with thy Holy Spirit that thy work may be revived in
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.360]   a mighty manner everywhere throughout the world. O wilt thou do such a work in us thy
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.600]   people that those who are without shall be amazed and astonished and shall come rushing,
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:40.040]   seeking to know the secret of it all. O God, revive thy work and make bare thy mighty arm.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:47.200]   O grant, if it be thy holy will, that in this year which is thus beginning we may see things
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.320]   that we cannot even imagine and experience the right hand of thy power in our midst.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   Hear us, O Lord, as we therefore commit thy people to thee in all parts of the world.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.600]   We thank thee, O Lord, for every movement of revival that we hear of. We thank thee
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.800]   for every stirring, every moving, every sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:19.480]   anywhere. O God, wilt thou continue and increase it until there shall indeed be a mighty work
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.880]   amongst thy people. We therefore commit it humbly to thee. We pray thee to bless and
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.400]   encourage all thy servants, whatever form their service takes. We commit to thee all
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.160]   who are preaching the word today everywhere throughout the world. O God, we remember likewise
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.360]   those who are engaged in Sunday school work and in the leadership of Bible classes and
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.580]   other meetings. O wilt thou encourage them all and strengthen them and enable them, O
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.880]   God, to know that with thy anointing upon them there is no end to the possibilities
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.600]   of what they may accomplish. We especially pray for those of thy servants who are set
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.560]   in difficult and trying and discouraging places. O wilt thou establish them and strengthen
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:11.640]   them and enable them to know that their labour can never be in vain in the Lord. O God, remember
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:18.280]   those who are being persecuted and tried, those, O Lord, who may be in prisons and concentration
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.140]   camps. We plead for thy servants in many lands this day who are meeting cruel opposition
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:31.520]   and great discouragement. We pray that their hearts may be uplifted and that they may be
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:38.080]   filled with such a courage that men can never daunt them, and they will go forward upon
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.840]   their way. O Lord, hear us as thus we commit all thy people and all thy servants to thy
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:51.880]   tender care. And hear us, O Lord, as we intercede on behalf of the world in its pain and sin
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:59.480]   and shame and confusion. O Lord, our God, wilt thou not show the people clearly by a
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.440]   manifestation of thy might the sinfulness of their state, and that while it persists
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:12.040]   there can be nothing but wars and rumours of wars and discord and bloodshed? God, have
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.640]   mercy upon the nations. We pray for those whom thou hast appointed to rule and to govern
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.440]   in this and in all the lands. We pray thee to humble them under thine almighty hand.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.920]   Present unto all leaders of the nations a new seriousness, a new striving after godliness
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.840]   and holiness, that they, standing before the peoples, may ever be a pattern of righteous
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:42.640]   living and of holiness. Lord, hear us as we pray for them, and hear us as we commit to
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.040]   thee all kinds and conditions of men. We pray for those who are old and infirm. O God, wilt
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.320]   thou look upon them tenderly and bless them. Be with them, we pray thee, and keep them
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.800]   at peace. Enable those who are with them and who care for them. O God, strengthen them
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.160]   and uphold them with thy powerful hand. Bless the sick in mind and the sick in body. O Lord,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.800]   thou canst deal with all and relieve all. We therefore commit them lovingly to thee
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.160]   and their loved ones. And we remember the bereaved and sorrowing, those to whom a new
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:22.200]   year has no hope and no brightness. O God, keep them, we pray thee, from living on the
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:28.000]   past, and grant them such a view of the glory that awaits all who are in Christ, that they
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.640]   will look forward with a new hope and be enabled even to rejoice in the midst of their sorrow.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.520]   And all others who need our prayers, we bring before thee, Lord, there may be those in our
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.720]   midst who have come with a sense of shame, determined to start anew and afresh, conscious
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.560]   of failure, conscious of inability. O God, wilt thou grant them an abundant assurance
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:58.840]   of the pardon of all their sins. May they know that the past shall be forgotten and
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:06.760]   a present joy be given, a future grace be promised, a glorious hope in heaven. Lord,
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.600]   wilt thou fill them with thine own sense of presence and of power, that they may face
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.840]   the future with all its temptations and all its subtle enticements, with a new confidence
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.120]   and a new hope. Hear us, O Lord, in these our prayers. Receive again, we ask our unworthy
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:33.240]   and humble prayers, as we offer it all, pleading nothing but the name and the merit of thy
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.200]   dear Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   Let us all pray. Almighty and ever-blessed God, our Heavenly Father, we come unto thee
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.520]   again and we thank thee once more, O Lord our God, that we find ourselves in such a
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.680]   place and in such an attitude and in such a posture. We thank thee for the place wherein
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.480]   thine honour dwells. We thank thee, O Lord, for a place in a world of sin and shame and
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.920]   noise and bustle, where we can come together quietly and worship thee and sing thy praise
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.720]   and read thy word. O God, we thank thee that in a world of so much darkness we come to
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:40.520]   a place where we have so often seen the light. O Lord, we thank thee that thou hast provided
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:48.400]   thus for us as we pass through this world of time, that we can come together and see
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.720]   something of that grace and of that glory. We thank thee, O Lord, that thou art a sun
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.760]   and a shield. And so we thank thee for all that we are conscious of as we gather together
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.640]   thus in thy house this evening. We thank thee, O God, for the very precincts of thy house.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.180]   We thank thee for the atmosphere which we are ever conscious of when a number of thy
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.400]   people come together to worship thee and to sing thy praise in this way. We thank thee,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.960]   O God, for an atmosphere that is so different from that of which we are aware outside in
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.560]   the world. O Lord, we know not how to thank thee sufficiently that thou hast ordained
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   that thy people should come together in this way and manner and as they go through this
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.920]   journey called life might rest a while. O God, we therefore lift up our hearts in humble
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:47.560]   praise and adoration for all thy goodness to us and for all the possibilities that we
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:54.160]   are conscious of at this very moment here in thy presence. Lord, we do bless thee and
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.840]   thy great and holy name more and more that we are ever conscious of this other factor
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:07.800]   that changes everything because we know that we are not left to ourselves. O God, we have
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:14.960]   so often been disappointed in the world and its gatherings and its conventions. We realize,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.160]   O Lord, that they have ever failed us because there was nothing beyond the power of men.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:27.960]   That we bless thee that thou art here and that with thee nothing is impossible and that
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.740]   therefore impossible things can happen. We thank thee, O Lord, our God, that we ever
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.720]   come therefore into thy house and into thy presence in a spirit of expectation and of
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:46.280]   anticipation. O God, we pray thee that thou wouldst create that within us all this night
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.080]   if we haven't got it and that thou wouldst increase it in us if we do possess it in
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.700]   a measure. O God, forgive us that we have so often been guilty of measuring thine illimitable
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:05.240]   power by our small and puny measures. Help us to know tonight that thou art able to do
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.960]   for us exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think. Help us, O God, to see
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:19.760]   something tonight anew and afresh of the unsearchable riches of Christ. O Lord, enlarge our hearts,
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:26.800]   we pray thee. Enlarge our minds. Open our understandings. Take from us, O God, all that
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.160]   restrains us and fetters us. Grant that we may know thy spirit operating in us and upon
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:40.580]   us in great power and in great freedom. O Lord, we know that as we pray thus we are
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.240]   only praying for that which thou hast so often done for thy people. We thank thee for all
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.260]   the records that we have behind us. We thank thee for thy word. We thank thee, O Lord,
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:59.080]   for all those many occasions we read of how thou didst come down amongst thy people. Coming
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:05.000]   down thou didst change everything. We thank thee, O Lord, for the descent of the Holy
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.800]   Ghost on the day of Pentecost and his coming again in like manner upon those early apostles
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.360]   and disciples. We remember how on one occasion the place where they were assembled together
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:23.120]   was shaken. O Lord, thou art the same God. Thou art the God of our fathers, the God of
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.880]   the patriarchs, the God of the apostles, the God of all the martyrs and the confessors,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.680]   the God of the reformers, the Puritans, the Covenanters, the God of the Methodist fathers.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.240]   Thou art still the same. And therefore we humbly pray thee to look upon us here gathered
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:48.100]   in thy presence this night and to pour down thy Spirit upon us. For we know, O Lord, that
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:55.240]   apart from thy Spirit and his mighty and gracious operations our coming together will be in
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.560]   vain, though we may enjoy it and may have found peace and comfort. But, O Lord, we long
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:07.360]   for thee, the living God. Our souls cry out for thee. O God, wilt thou therefore raise
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:14.080]   us up above every other consideration and grant us one by one a great soul thirst for
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:21.480]   thee? Lord, thou knowest all about us, and we rejoice in that fact. We confess that there
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.680]   have been times when we were terrified by that fact, but now we thank thee for it, for
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:34.200]   we have so often discovered that we were not aware of our true needs. We thought we understood,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.280]   but we were wrong. We were protecting ourselves. We thought we needed comfort when we needed
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:45.320]   justicement. O Lord, we thank thee then that thou knowest all about us and that thou art
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.560]   able to deal with us and our every need and our every condition. We pray thee therefore
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.880]   that this night thou dost take thine own great and glorious Word and bring it home to us
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:02.160]   one by one in great power and authority and might. O Lord, wilt thou speak tonight in
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.760]   such a manner that we shall all know that thou hast been speaking and that we shall
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.640]   never be the same again? We thank thee, O Lord, for thy promises. We thank thee that
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.800]   they are exceedingly great and precious, and we pray that thou wouldst graciously fulfil
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.400]   them in our midst here in thy presence at this very hour. Lord, we therefore surrender
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.800]   this service into thy hands and pray that thou wouldst use it to their end, and hear
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.480]   us as we think of all thy people gathered together like this in all parts of the world.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.080]   O Lord, we thank thee that even in these days thou hast thy faithful people. We thank thee
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.320]   for them, and we pray that they this night may know great liberty and freedom in thy
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.400]   presence. We continue to pray for all who are hard-pressed and persecuted and tried.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.680]   We pray for all little groups of people meeting together in fear and trembling because of
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   authorities and powers set against them. Back in the conditions of the early church, O God,
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   wilt thou be with them as thou wert with thy servants at the beginning, and fill them with
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.840]   a sense of thy glory and of thy power. Take from them the spirit of fear, O Lord, and
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.360]   grant that they may be enabled to witness the good confession.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.120]   We again would commend to thee most urgently, O Lord, the case of many of thy people in
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.720]   many countries in different parts of the world, where they have suddenly found themselves
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.440]   in new circumstances and conditions, thrust into positions of leadership and power, whereas
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.800]   formerly they had depended upon others. O Lord, wilt thou be with them. Wilt thou give
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.600]   them great wisdom and great understanding, and show them what thou wouldst have them
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.700]   do. O Lord, we commit them and commend them unto thee in all parts of the world.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:53.440]   Great God, we do indeed pray that thou wouldst, in the midst of the years and all the darkness
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:24:01.600]   and the confusion of the times, make thyself known in a mighty manner. Lord, we thank thee
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.520]   for the faith that thou hast given us. We thank thee that we know that thou wilt vindicate
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.680]   thyself and thy great truth. We know that thou hast thy known time, O Lord. Forgive
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.440]   us if we are guilty of impatience before thee, but we see thy name blasphemed, thy cause
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:24.120]   desecrated, and we pray thee therefore, O Lord, to rise in thy glory and power, and
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.080]   to make thyself known, and cause the peoples who are antagonistic and opposed to tremble
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:36.480]   in thy great and holy presence. Hear us, O God, in this our prayer, and hear us as we
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:42.000]   again commend to thee the powers that be. We pray for all that are in authority. We
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.720]   pray for those who reign and rule over us, and all the leaders and the rulers of all
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:53.400]   the nations. Lord, wilt thou deal with them so that, set as they are in positions of prominence,
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.200]   they ever may be a pattern of godliness and righteousness and holy living to the peoples.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.120]   O Lord, wilt thou look upon them and give them the wisdom that they need in these times
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.880]   of troubles. Show them, O God, what thou wouldst have them do. We bless thee that we know that
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:16.600]   thy purposes are sure, and we rest in the confidence that thy kingdom shall come, and
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.160]   that Christ Jesus shall rule and reign over all. Hear us, O Lord, and hear us as again
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.840]   with tenderness we bring before thee the case of many who have asked for our petitions.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.300]   There are those who are old and infirm. We pray that as they lose the power and the position
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:42.200]   of their faculties, that thou wouldst grant unto them, O God, thy new and sustaining grace.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.840]   Give unto them such glimpses of the glory that thou art preparing for them, that their
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.320]   hearts may be gladdened and that they may be filled with joy. Lord, hear us on behalf
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.140]   of those who are sick in body, wherever they are tonight, whether in their own homes or
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.840]   in nursing homes or institutions. We pray thee, O God, to be with them, and may they
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.560]   know above everything else that they are in thy hands, and may they know that there they
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.480]   are ever safe. Lord, bless them and keep them and their loved ones from anxious care. We
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.880]   pray for those who are sick in mind and pray that they may be relieved, and we remember
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.720]   the bereaved and the sorrowing. O Lord, God of comfort and of consolation, we pray thee
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:31.120]   to bless all such and to draw them even through their grief and sorrow nearer unto thyself.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.160]   We remember all who are in any kind of trouble. We realize, O God, more and more how little
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.400]   we know of one another. The heart knoweth her own bitterness. We pray thee, therefore,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.880]   for any who are heavy-hearted in this service, any who are conscious of failure and of sin
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:55.560]   and of shame. O God, we thank thee that we can pray for all such with great confidence.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.640]   Thou hast told us that if we confess our sins, that thou art faithful and just to forgive
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:07.320]   us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. We pray, therefore, that all such may know
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.600]   the blessed cleansing and may know that they are restored unto thee. Have mercy upon those
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.120]   who may be amongst us who have been backsliding, fallen into sin and have wandered far away.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.160]   Lord, we thank thee that thou art still as the father of that prodigal son, and may they
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.840]   know that there is an abundant welcome to them as they return this evening. Will thou
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:37.600]   heal them and restore them and establish their goings and send them upon their way rejoicing?
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.960]   O Lord, we thank thee that thy love never faileth. We thank thee, O Lord, that whenever
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.520]   we come truly unto thee, acknowledging our sin and looking only unto Jesus Christ and
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:57.080]   his blood, thou dost ever pardon us and forgive us and renew us and restore us. Hear us then,
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.240]   O Lord, and glorify thy name in our midst, and unto thee shall we give all the praise
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:09.280]   and all the honour and all the glory. Hear us, O Lord, and pardon and forgive us all
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.840]   our every sin as we ask these mercies, pleading nothing but the name and the merit of thy
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.680]   dear Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:38.620]   Let us all pray. Almighty and ever blessed God, our Heavenly Father, we come again into
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:45.120]   thy holy presence and we come once more, O Lord, that we may thank thee and praise thy
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:52.760]   great and holy name. We marvel more and more, O Lord, at thy kindness toward us and at thine
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:59.840]   infinite condescension, that thou art so great and high and eternal, thou dost deign to look
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:08.560]   upon us and art ready to listen to us as we come into thy presence in this way and manner.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.200]   We thank thee, O Lord, for the abundant assurance thou hast given us, that everything concerning
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:22.760]   us is of concern to thee, that thou hast loved us with an everlasting love. And so, O Lord
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.840]   our God, we do indeed thank thee and bless thy name for this above everything else. We
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:34.640]   thank thee for every blessing that we have ever received, but we thank thee more, O Lord
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:41.720]   our God, that we have received those blessings because of our relationship to thee in and
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:49.840]   through thy dear Son, our blessed Lord and Saviour. We rejoice, O Lord, in the relationship,
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:56.800]   in the fellowship, even more than in the particular blessings. And so it is, O Lord, that as we
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:02.960]   come before thee this morning, our chiefest desire is that we may know thee better and
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:10.820]   know thee more truly. Lord, we are conscious of the fact that oftentimes we have been content
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:16.320]   with the means of grace and have stopped at them instead of using them and implying them
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:24.280]   to bring us unto thyself and into a living relationship with thee. We thank thee again
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.760]   for everything that thou hast appointed for us. And for our good, we thank thee that thou
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.520]   at the very beginning didst ordain that a day like this should be set aside and apart
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:42.000]   and that man should cease from his work and give himself to contemplation and meditation
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.280]   of his relationship to thee and the affairs of his soul. We thank thee, O Lord, for this
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.920]   and for every other provision. We thank thee for every good tradition that we have inherited
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:00.280]   and every good and noble custom. We thank thee, O Lord, for giving us thy word and its
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:06.560]   truth. We thank thee for all the instruction that we have here. Lord, thou hast provided
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:13.440]   for us so fully and so liberally, and yet we are conscious of the fact that oftentimes
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.320]   we have abused these gifts and privileges and have turned them into ends rather than
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:26.620]   means and so have missed the greatest and the most glorious blessing of all. We pray
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:33.160]   thee, therefore, that by thy spirit this morning thou wouldst take hold of us and possess us.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:39.360]   We realize the need of being roused in all our faculties. We confess that we are still
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:48.120]   so much of the earth earthy, by and bound to the things of time and of sense. O Lord,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:55.080]   we pray thee to grant us, as thy people, liberty in thy presence at this hour. Grant freedom
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.880]   unto our spirits, we humbly pray thee. Help us, O God, one by one to realize that whatever
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:08.080]   our affairs and our circumstances, there is nothing that is of such importance to us as
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.840]   this living knowledge of thee and this living relationship to thee. We pray, therefore,
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.040]   that we all may have the grace that we stand in need of to overcome every hindrance and
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:28.120]   difficulty and obstacle in order that we may worship thee in spirit and in truth. Lord,
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:34.840]   we thank thee for the gift of thy most holy spirit, the spirit that searcheth all things,
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:41.440]   yea, the deep things of God, the spirit that maketh intercession for us with groanings
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:48.480]   which cannot be uttered. We thank thee, then, O Lord, that thou hast thus provided for us
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:55.400]   so richly. And we rejoice in thy presence at this moment that we realize, therefore,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:01.040]   that what matters above everything else is that we should be ready and willing to yield
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:08.480]   and to submit ourselves to his most gracious influences upon us. We pray thee, therefore,
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.520]   O God, that thou wouldst give us that grace and that we may feel his mighty working within
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:22.600]   us. O Lord, we thank thee that this is ever to be the characteristic of thy people, that
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.480]   they are to know this glorious liberty of the children of God, and that we are to enjoy
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:35.920]   this freedom in worship. We bless thee that we are no longer dependent upon forms and
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.400]   ceremonies and externals. We thank thee, O Lord, that God is spirit and that they that
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. We bless thee that thou hast opened
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:53.440]   our eyes to see that, and that we, therefore, are in the realm of the spirit. But we do
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:00.000]   pray thee, O Lord, our God, that we may enter fully into this, that we may truly know what
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.880]   it is to rejoice before thee and to be filled with the sense of wonder, love, and of praise.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.240]   We do thank thee, O Lord, for all the way that thou hast brought us. We are conscious
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.960]   increasingly that it is because of thy good hand upon us that we have arrived at this
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:24.140]   point. We raise our Ebenezer, hither by thine help we are come, and we hope by thy good
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:30.720]   pleasure safely to arrive at home. We thank thee, O Lord, that thou, having apprehended
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:37.040]   us, having laid thy mighty hand upon us, that thou dost continue to lead us on and to guide
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:43.080]   us and to direct us. And we thank thee for the assurance that thou hast given us that
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:49.480]   thou wilt never leave us nor forsake us. O Lord, we, therefore, in thy holy presence
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   in this way and manner would acknowledge again that we are what we are by thy grace. And
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.560]   we humbly pray thee, O Lord, to go on with thy great and good work within us. We pray
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.320]   thee, O Lord, that thou wouldst bring home to us one by one at a time such as this our
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:14.760]   individual responsibility. Lord, we find ourselves in a gainsaying world. We find ourselves in
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   an age and a time of confusion and of trouble. We pray thee, therefore, O Lord, that every
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   one of us may realize our individual responsibility with respect to these things. Forgive us,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.680]   O Lord, if we tend ever to delegate these matters to others. We thank thee that in thy
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.960]   church, because of her marvellous constitution, it is possible for any individual amongst
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:46.760]   us to be laid hold of by thy power and to do mighty and wonderful things. We pray thee,
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.880]   therefore, that we all may have a zeal for thy great and holy name and a concern about
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:59.640]   thy church and about thy kingdom. O Lord, we humbly pray thee, therefore, to so speak
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:05.480]   to thy faithful people here and in this land and everywhere else throughout the world that
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.520]   they may realize more clearly than ever the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. Deliver us,
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.120]   O God, from every wrong and false entanglement. Deliver us from everything that in any way
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:24.600]   mars or hinders the proclamation of thy truth. But grant, O Lord, that we all may seek to
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.920]   know the truth as it is in simplicity and as it is in purity in Christ Jesus, and that
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:37.560]   at the same time we may manifest it and demonstrate it by our lives and conduct and demeanour
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:44.240]   and behaviour. O Lord, we ask, therefore, that upon us thy people may come this sense
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.800]   of being engaged in this mighty spiritual battle and warfare. Grant that we all, therefore,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.880]   may fight the good fight of faith, that we may quit ourselves as men and be strong, standing
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:03.240]   steadfastly in the faith. O Lord, we ask, therefore, that upon us and upon thy people
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:10.480]   everywhere thou wouldst send forth thy Spirit in great power and authority and might. We
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:16.560]   do realize, O Lord, that our words in and of themselves, even though they may give expression
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:24.080]   to the truth, are inadequate and insufficient. We are conscious, O Lord, of the need of the
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.680]   demonstration of the Spirit and of power. We thank thee that we are encouraged by the
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.240]   history of the past. We thank thee, O Lord, that we see even in thy word itself how oftentimes
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.520]   thy people have been languishing and have been ineffective, and the enemy has been loud
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:48.680]   and arrogant and proud. Thy people seemed, at the very end of their history, when suddenly
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   thou didst arise and scatter thine enemies and show forth thy glory and thy praise. And
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.360]   we thank thee, O Lord, for the many, many occasions in the subsequent history of thy
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:07.320]   church and people on which thou hast been pleased to do this. Lord, we acknowledge before
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.040]   thee that we have no claim upon thy love and mercy and compassion. We plead it rather for
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:20.800]   the glory of thy known name. O Lord, O our God, arise; the cause of truth maintain. O
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.480]   Lord, hear us and hear all thy people who, everywhere throughout the world, are waiting
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:33.680]   and looking unto thee for such a visitation of thy Spirit in power and might and authority.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:39.480]   Lord, grant that men and women may know in this twentieth century that thou abidest ever
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:45.920]   always the same, and that all the changing scenes of time make no difference unto thee.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:53.000]   O Lord, we pray thee, therefore, to revive thy work and to make bare thy mighty arm in
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.760]   the midst of wrath. Remember mercy, O Lord, for the sake of thy known name and this name
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.360]   of thy dear Son, our blessed Lord and Saviour. Hear us, O Lord, in this our prayer. But we
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.480]   ask thee that thou wouldest look upon us and bless us this day as we come and consider
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.280]   thy word, and bless all thy people everywhere as they do the same thing. We ask thy blessing
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.800]   upon the work of the Sunday school today, here and elsewhere, and upon all gatherings
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.760]   of thy people, to enter more richly into the riches of thy grace. O Lord, bless all the
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:33.160]   efforts of thy people. Keep us all, we pray thee, from discouragement, but grant that
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:39.400]   thy servants everywhere may know that their labour is never in vain in the Lord.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:45.760]   O God, hear us in this our prayer, and hear us, we humbly beseech thee, as we particularly
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.360]   intercede on behalf of those of thy people who are passing through a period of cruel
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:56.400]   adversity. We think of all thy people in various lands, certain places we know where there
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.920]   are but a handful of people with a great mass against them, not only the world, the flesh,
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:08.920]   the devil, but false religion and misunderstanding, and a lie preached as truth. We pray that
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:16.520]   in all such places thy servants and thy people may be kept steadfast in the faith, that they
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:23.240]   may know that thou art with them and that thou wilt use them and bless them. O Lord,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.120]   grant them the courage that thou didst give to the apostles at the beginning, and to the
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.200]   martyrs and the confessors throughout the centuries. We pray then for thy servants everywhere
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:38.400]   throughout the world, and especially in such lands and places where there is cruel and
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.600]   bitter persecution. We pray thy blessing upon all thy servants who have gone out from this
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   land and other lands to help others to propagate the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. We thank
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.320]   thee for them and their readiness to leave all in order that they may serve thee in this
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:01.760]   way and manner. Will thou bless them and grant them great wisdom in these days of transition
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.280]   and of confusion. Hear us, O God, in this hour of prayer. And, O Lord, as we pray thus
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.360]   for thy church and people, we are conscious that she operates in the world, and we remember
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:18.040]   that the world is still thine in spite of all its sin and shame. We therefore pray thee,
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.920]   O Lord, to look down in pity and compassion upon the world. We pray for the powers that
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.520]   be that thou hast ordained. We ask thy blessing upon those who reign and rule over us and
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:35.000]   on those who are responsible for the affairs of all the nations. Lord, wilt thou look upon
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.600]   them and bless them and show them thy way. And hear us, O Lord, as we think of all individuals
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.800]   who need our prayers. We do rejoice in the knowledge that thou art so great and high
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.480]   and eternal that the very nations are but as a drop in the bucket and the small dust
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.680]   of the balance in thy sight, that nevertheless thou art prepared to look upon the individual,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:04.320]   and that none is too small or insignificant for thy loving gaze. O Lord, we pray therefore
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:09.480]   for the aged and the infirm, all who are kept in their homes and unable to come out. We
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:14.680]   pray that thou wouldst be a little sanctuary unto them, and that they may know thy presence
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:20.160]   and rejoice in it. Hear us as we remember those who are ill and laid aside with physical
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.840]   illness wherever they are at this hour, Lord, we remember them, and we pray that thou wouldst
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:31.560]   visit them and bless them. Be with their loved ones and keep them from anxious care, O Lord.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:37.640]   Hear us on behalf of the sick in mind as we pray that they may be delivered and set free.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:43.560]   And hear us, O God, on behalf of the bereaved and the sorrowing and the lonely. We thank
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:50.480]   thee for a gospel that enables us to see through death. We thank thee for an undying hope.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.920]   We thank thee, O Lord, for the glory that awaits thy people, and we pray that all who
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.960]   are bereaved and sorrowing may be comforted and sustained and encouraged by the knowledge
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:08.920]   of these things. Hear us, O Lord, our God, in these our prayers. Thou knowest every individual.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.560]   Thou knowest the secret prayers of all who are in thy presence at this hour. We pray
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.200]   thee that thou wouldst hear them. Thou hast promised to do so whatever it is that is oppressing
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:26.120]   any mind or any heart or troubling any soul before thee. We pray that the truth as it
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.760]   is in Christ Jesus may so come to them, that their burden shall be lifted and that they
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.920]   shall go out of this service renewed in faith, in courage, and in hope. Hear us, O Lord,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:45.840]   in this our prayer, and pardon and forgive us all our every sin as we ask these mercies,
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:52.160]   pleading nothing but the name and the merit of thy dear Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.280]   Christ. Amen.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:05.680]   O Lord, our God, we come unto thee once more and lift up our hearts in praise and in thanksgiving
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:13.240]   and in humble acknowledgment that we are saved by grace and that not of ourselves. It is
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:20.280]   the gift of God. We acknowledge, O God, freely, that it is all of grace. We are aware of our
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:26.840]   unworthiness. We say with him, "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:33.800]   Saviour's blood? Died he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:42.600]   amazing love? And can it be that thou, my God, hast died for me?" 'Tis mystery all.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:51.320]   O Lord, we leave ourselves in the grip of this glorious mystery. We humbly thank thee
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:45:01.080]   and praise thy great and holy name that we are what we are. Solely by the grace of God
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:09.120]   thou hast indeed taken away the stony heart and given us a heart of flesh to know thee
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:19.440]   and to love thee. Lord, it is my chief complaint that my love is weak and faint. Yet I love
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:26.680]   thee and adore, O for grace, to love thee more.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:33.440]   Now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:51.560]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:46:04.360]   O Lord, O God, we come again to thank thee for thy word. O, how we see ourselves and
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:12.720]   our promise to wonder how ready we are to detract and to subtract from thy word, to
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.440]   make things easy for ourselves. But we bless thee that we have this word that not only
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:25.680]   teaches us and instructs us, but warns us and safeguards us from the subtle assaults
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:32.080]   of the enemy of our souls, who, appearing as an angel of light, would twist and pervert
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:42.360]   even thy holy word. O God, receive our humble prayers. We thank thee for the faith we have.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:50.600]   And O Lord, we all pray that thou wouldst grant us more and more that assurance clear.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:57.320]   O God, so speak to us that we shall all give great diligence to making our calling and
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:05.080]   election sure. Thou hast provided the way to this. Grant that all thy people, thy dear
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   children here gathered, may now, as they've never known before, the Spirit bearing witness
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:17.340]   with their spirits that they are the children of God. Grant that they may know during this
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:25.840]   coming season that the one who was born of old in Bethlehem of Judea has also been born
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:32.920]   in their hearts and in their souls. Grant that we all may know of a surety, a Christ
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:42.160]   within, a living Christ dwelling within us, taking up his abode within us and never leaving
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:51.560]   us. O Lord, hear our prayer. Be with us, follow us, be with us in our homes, in our work,
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:57.200]   wherever we may have to go, whatever we may have to do. Lord, may we know that thou wilt
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:04.600]   never leave us nor forsake us, and may we know the sweet intimations of thy nearness
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:12.520]   and thy benediction, thy love and thy grace. Bless, O God, thy faithful people who long
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:18.240]   to know thee better and to know the truth more truly. Bless them and all who are dear
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:26.400]   to them and bless them in all their associations. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:33.680]   Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   and continue with us now this night until we meet again throughout the remainder of
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:59.560]   this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:08.120]   O Lord, our God, we pray thee, as thy servant of old prayed, O for a thousand tongues to
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:20.960]   sing my great Redeemer's praise, the glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:30.280]   O God, have mercy upon us that we are so slow to thank thee and to praise thee. O Lord,
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:39.880]   open our eyes to the knowledge of this great riches, the unsearchable riches of Christ,
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:47.920]   who is so rich unto all that call upon him. Lord, fill us with thy Spirit. Fill us, we
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:53.320]   pray thee, until our hearts shall overflow. Shed thy love abroad in our hearts by thy
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:50:02.880]   most blessed Holy Spirit until we shall be lost in wonder, love, and praise. O, that
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:11.320]   I could forever sit like Mary at the Master's feet, be this my happy choice, my only care,
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:19.520]   delight, and bliss, my joy, my heaven on earth, be this, to hear the Bridegroom's voice.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:29.200]   O love divine, how sweet thou art. When shall I find my willing heart all taken up by thee?
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   I thirst, I faint, I die to prove the greatness of redeeming love, the love of Christ to me.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:48.480]   O Lord, open our eyes to the riches of thy grace, and then we know that we shall praise
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:56.680]   thee with the whole of our being, and say, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:06.040]   is within me. Bless his holy name." And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:11.520]   and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:17.960]   continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this our short and certain
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:28.040]   earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see him as he is, in all his glory and
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:37.600]   beauty and perfection, and be like him, until the story, saved by grace, and go on to all
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:51.000]   eternity to marvel at the unsearchable riches of Christ. Amen.
