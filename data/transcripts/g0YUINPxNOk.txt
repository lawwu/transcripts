[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [Silence]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.720]   >> Well, good afternoon, Joe.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.680]   We have finished both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the whole Bible is in.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.320]   And in the process, not only did we translate, but people had some questions for us and different
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.600]   kinds of people, not just people who are reading the current translation that's out, but also
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.440]   reviewers who have reviewed our notes on translation and such, and several questions have crossed
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.160]   my desk, and I thought this would be a good time for us to talk about some of the dominant
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   ones.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.600]   So, with that, here's one of those questions that people have posed.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.640]   One is, were there any systematic yet subtle changes in the Old Testament?
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.740]   We're thinking about like a verb translation, a verb tense that was brought out, similar
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.480]   to how we did the imperfect in the Greek New Testament, in the New Testament translation
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.920]   of the Scriptures.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.240]   Is there anything like that?
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.800]   People know about the translation of Yahweh, they know about the major things, but were
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.320]   there subtle things on that line that we brought out?
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.860]   >> Well, that was part of our goal and part of our desire, part of our translation philosophy
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.200]   to make things as consistent as possible, but also as precise as possible.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.960]   So, there were a few things.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.600]   One thing that I'm thinking right off the bat is our treatment of the element, the macro
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.520]   syntactical marker or the discourse marker, which sometimes introduces a paragraph, other
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.120]   times it brings the paragraph to the climax.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.040]   So, in Hebrew, it would be the "vayehi" form or the "vihaya" form, the "vayehi" being in
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.680]   the past tense, the "vihaya" being in the future tense, and again, for the most part,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.560]   you know how it is sometimes.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.240]   So, when we worked with that, we were basing our translation on Nazbi, so it was already
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.720]   there, but we tried to make it more systematic.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.240]   >> So, how would it appear in the Nazbi at times?
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.360]   >> So, let's take an example from Genesis chapter 4.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.520]   This is where Cain kills Abel, and then God appears to Cain, and God speaks to Cain, and
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.000]   He says to him, "Where's your brother?"
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.200]   And so, in that conversation, God speaks, God says to Cain that He's going to send him
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   out, and He's going to cast him out, and Cain, in a way, laments that, and he says, "I have
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.440]   been cast out from your presence, and I'm going to be a vagrant and a wanderer," and
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.480]   then most of the translations have it as, "Whoever finds me will kill me."
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.880]   Well, that's a climax of that verse and of Cain's statement, and so really, in the Hebrew,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.040]   it says, it has the discourse marker which shows to us that this is a climax, and so
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.640]   really, it's supposed to be, "And it will be that whoever finds me will kill me."
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.240]   And so, we introduced that element into the LSB translation so that you can see that it's
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   a climax.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.360]   >> So, for the reader now, when they see phrases like, "Now it happened," or "And it will be,"
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.120]   they know this could be a start of a new paragraph, this could be a climactic moment, this could
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.400]   be even a conclusion to an entire idea.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   Is that what's going on?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.440]   >> That's exactly right, and just since you brought up the past tense, you can think about
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.240]   the Joseph narrative, and one of the famous parts is when Mrs. Potiphar, so to say, she
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.520]   tempts Joseph, and so in that description and the discussion that they have in chapter
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.680]   39, you have the part where Joseph goes into the house, and in a way, that's the beginning
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.800]   of the paragraph.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.500]   So it says, "Now it happened that Joseph went into the house," and that introduces that
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.600]   portion of the paragraph, and Joseph is alone in the house, and Mrs. Potiphar happens to
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.460]   be there, all the men are gone, and so she tempts him there, she grabs him by the clothes,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.780]   and she takes his garment, and he flees without his garment, and then it says that, "And now
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.700]   it happened when she saw that she had his garment," so that the part, "Now it happened,"
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.460]   is also the discourse marker, but in this case, it brings the whole story to the climax.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.420]   It's in the middle of the story, it's in the middle of the paragraph, and it says there
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.660]   that she saw the clothes that she had with him, and she was going to make a decision,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.380]   and so when she sees that she has the garment, then she cries out, then she calls out to
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.100]   the men, and the men come in, and she begins to explain to them the story that their leader
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.960]   brought in this slave who was going to tempt her, if you will, and she repeats this discourse
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.100]   marker, and she says that, "And now it happened that when he saw that he left his clothes,
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.420]   he ran away and he fled."
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.940]   So the Hebrew uses this marker, "Now it happened," to introduce a paragraph, or it uses this
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.460]   discourse marker to bring the story to a climax, to show that this is the central point, or
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.220]   this is the peak of the narrative where something very important happens, and so she does this.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.740]   And it happens actually throughout Genesis 39, so that you see where the paragraph begins
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.300]   and where it climaxes.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.940]   And so we did that throughout the Old Testament, just making sure that it's visible, making
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.820]   sure that it's clear, so that the readers can take note of it, and again, this is building
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.380]   on what Nazbi had already been doing, we just made it more systematic.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.300]   So when you read the Hebrew Bible, you look for those discourse markers, you look for
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.580]   those narrative markers, and the va'iktol, and such, is that right?
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.580]   That's exactly right.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.660]   You see those, you take note of them, and you actually see what are they doing.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.300]   And one of our philosophies of translation, or parts of the philosophy, was to make sure
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.100]   that if it's in the Hebrew text, and we can bring it into the English text and make sense,
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.500]   we want to do that, because we want to bring everything from the Hebrew into the English,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.020]   so that when the people treat the Bible and they study it, they see exactly what the Hebrew
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.020]   had.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.020]   And that's exactly it, isn't it?
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.500]   It's so that when they see the English, it's as if they're like you when you see the Hebrew.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.860]   It's a parallel kind of experience.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.580]   Yeah, and this goes back to the analogy that we've been using, looking at it through the
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.740]   window.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.580]   That's really helpful, and now when people see those words, they know the significance,
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.020]   the role, the important role, that they play as the author, inspired by God, writes it
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.020]   all down.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.020]   Really, really good.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.140]   Here's another question, and I think this one's addressed to me.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.700]   People wonder about the translation of chesed.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.380]   They say, "Can you change it?
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.700]   Can you change it to something else?"
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.300]   And they have all kinds of suggestions about it.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.820]   I get a lot of these, and the question is why, as already the New Testament Psalms of
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.780]   Proverbs has indicated, why keep it as loving kindness?
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.920]   Why retain that?
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.980]   And I think our answer, as we discussed it, was that there is a tradition behind this
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.980]   word.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.580]   It goes back to some of the oldest English translations, and there's something to be
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.620]   said for connecting what we have today with things back in the day, with those who have
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.660]   preceded us.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.800]   It demonstrates that the faith, once and for all, delivered to the saints is exactly that.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.100]   It is what we have is what they had.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.500]   What they had is what we have.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.040]   We do not have a different doctrine.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.000]   We do not have a different scripture.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.540]   Our scripture is the same, and that tradition reflects that.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.640]   And on top of that, retaining loving kindness, I would say, prevents an assumption.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.980]   If we kind of translated it a little bit more idiomatically, people could presume that they
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.860]   understood what the word chesed meant.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.860]   They might think, "Oh, yeah, it's just steadfast love.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.860]   That's all that it is.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.860]   I understand it.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860]   Let's move on."
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.420]   But there's a bigger story to that word chesed.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.820]   There's a bigger story to the word loving kindness.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:00.240]   In fact, Halot, the major dictionaries, don't emphasize love in that term as much as they
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.400]   emphasize loyalty.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.660]   They emphasize fidelity.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.340]   They emphasize faithfulness and commitment.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.860]   And there's good reason for that, because Psalm 136, God causes the sun to rise and
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.580]   to set because of his loving kindness.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.100]   In Psalm 107, the parallel of loving kindness is not with God's love or affection to his
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.180]   people, but with his miraculous wonders and his awesome works.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.820]   That's the parallel to loving kindness, because in essence, loving kindness is more about
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:37.140]   God's commitment, a commitment and loyalty to, say, even the covenant that drives him
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.780]   to do whatever it takes to do what is right and do what he promised for the good of his
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.180]   people.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.740]   And this flows even into the New Testament, because the New Testament authors sometimes
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.420]   translate chesed as grace.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.640]   God is full of loving kindness and truth in the Old Testament.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.580]   And in the New Testament, Jesus is full of grace and truth.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.560]   But we know grace is not the same thing as love.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.340]   Grace is something distinct from love, and it reflects God's intervention, his irresistible
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.300]   grace in our lives.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.860]   And in the same manner, chesed is God's ultimate commitment and thereby his driving omnipotent
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.580]   power to do what is best for us.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.020]   And that is packaged in this one word.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:28.180]   And I think sometimes when we just translate it in a sensible way, people won't dig deeper.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.560]   And so retaining the word loving kindness is very, very useful in this way.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.960]   And along that line, sometimes because of translating with multiple words, you can run
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.880]   into a conundrum, translationally speaking.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.960]   In Isaiah 55, it talks about the great and steadfast love shown to David.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.800]   Well, it's not great and steadfast love.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.400]   It's just great loving kindness, abundant loving kindness.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:04.000]   But because if you use multiple terms to describe this one word, you're going to have to fiddle
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.840]   a little bit with how it is described and modified, which causes a shift in emphasis
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.580]   and maybe a misunderstanding what's going on in the original language.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.240]   So there's this kind of cascading effect that happens when sometimes we deviate from word
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   for word.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.160]   And plus, the word loving kindness as a translation of chesed is a good translation.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.400]   And so we're retaining that to affirm the translation that NASB has because it is a
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   good translation.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.520]   So those are some of the reasons behind loving kindness therein.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.080]   And the traditional way to go about it has actually a lot of advantages.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.960]   And ultimately, it just reminds us we shouldn't take words for granted.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.280]   We should continue to pursue and study them.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   We shouldn't assume that we really understand all that's packed in there because often there's
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.560]   a lot.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.520]   Speaking of words and the importance of words, another question that has crossed my desk
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:03.320]   is why did you guys change Song of Solomon to Song of Songs?
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.680]   There's a funny story and not a funny story, a good story.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.960]   I like it behind this.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.880]   And that is that in Old Testament survey, I teach a lot of students at the Masters University
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:20.560]   and I talk about how the opening of the book of the Song of Songs in Hebrew is Song of
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.720]   Songs and not Song of Solomon.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.200]   Do we believe Solomon wrote it?
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   Amen.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   Because the text says so.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Exactly.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.400]   And Solomon said that when I wrote it, the title is Song of Songs.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.200]   And so I talk about that with the students.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   And so a bunch of my Old Testament students wrote me and even talked to me in class and
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.240]   said, "Hey, when you do Legacy Standard Bible, aren't you going to do that change?"
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.760]   And so they kind of got involved in the process.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.620]   It was one of the joys as a prof to see that, that they were involved, that they wanted
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.000]   to say in it.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.320]   And we kind of decided together, "Yeah, I'll bring this before the committee."
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.200]   And we kind of pushed it forward in that way.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   That's a good joy.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.760]   And there's a theological reason for this.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.460]   And it was an easy decision to make.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.380]   I remember when we talked about it initially.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.760]   You talked to the students and whoever sees the Bible and knows what it says, for them,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   this is a given.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   It should be Song of Songs.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   Yes.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   Right.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   Exactly.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   Of course, we're going to translate it as such.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   That's right.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   That's what the text says.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.080]   So call the Bible by the title the Bible gives it.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   Exactly right.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.720]   And there's a reason for it because the most beautiful song of all is a song celebrating
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.280]   the highest human love, a love that ultimately, as we see throughout the whole breadth of
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.680]   Scripture, reflects God's redeeming, saving love for his bride, the church.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.200]   So there is this beautiful nature to this ultimate kind of song in and about human marriage
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.440]   and Song of Songs, but as we see it canonically, a bigger, grander theological idea.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.000]   So that's kind of the logic behind it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.720]   Another question that's come across is about the term fool in Proverbs.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.680]   And there are some different nuances.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:08.240]   I don't think people realize, perhaps, that there are multiple words for fool in the Scriptures.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.400]   And why did we bring that out, and how did we bring that out?
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.320]   Yeah, so that was already brought out in Proverbs.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.540]   And like you said, the word fool itself appears many times throughout the Scriptures.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.240]   And especially in Proverbs, it appears many, many times because there's a focus on wisdom
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.400]   and on folly.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.220]   And so when you read Proverbs, or any part of the Bible, but especially Proverbs and
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.400]   the Psalms, you see the word fool appearing.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   And when you read it in English, and I think most of the translations preceding the Legacy
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.600]   Standard Bible, you see the word fool and fool and fool and fool appear all throughout.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.200]   And you see that this is a discussion about fools, how not to be a fool, and what fools
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.560]   do and how they think.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.160]   But there are nuances to different types of fools.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.880]   And the Hebrew Bible has those nuances in each of the words that it uses.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.840]   So there are different words for the word fool.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.240]   Let me just bring out three of them, the three main ones.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.860]   If you look at Proverbs, Psalms, you will see that the noun for fool appears a hundred
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.860]   plus times.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.480]   So it's very common.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:22.200]   And you think about the most common one, which in Hebrew is kseed, appears in Proverbs many
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   times.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.400]   And if you think about the very familiar passage, do not answer a fool according to his folly,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.800]   answer a fool according to his folly, so that he doesn't think that he's wise, or so that
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.400]   you show him that he's not wise.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.560]   Well, there, the nuance is that this is kind of the general type of fool.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.660]   Yes, he has nefarious implications or intentions.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.440]   This is an insolent type of folly.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:55.140]   And because this is the most common type of fool, we've retained that as fool.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.840]   And so when people read the Proverbs and read the biblical text and they see fool, they
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.600]   will know that this refers to the most general type of fool.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.800]   Now you keep reading the Proverbs and you get to Proverbs, or you start with Proverbs
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   1.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.720]   There's another very common passage and this is Proverbs 1 verse 7.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.760]   And there you see the word evil for fool.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.000]   Now this is a different type of fool with a different nuance.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.440]   And the nuance here is that this fool is ignorant.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.480]   Fools despise wisdom and discipline.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.000]   That's the typical translation.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Now if you read the Legacy Standard Bible, you will see that it says ignorant fools despise
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.720]   wisdom and discipline.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.160]   Well, the nuance here is that they do not have sense, these types of fool.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.280]   They're lacking common sense.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:57.680]   I mean, to understand that discipline and wisdom is good for you is common sense, right?
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.220]   And so you receive it.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.440]   But these types of fools, the ignorant fools, they reject it and they despise it because
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:11.240]   they lack the common sense that you should have in order to accept discipline and wisdom.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.080]   And there is one more major one, and this is kind of the worst one of them all.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   The fool who is a godless fool or who is a wicked fool, and we rendered it as a wicked
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   fool.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.520]   You think about Psalm 14.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.040]   The fool has said in his heart, there is no God, right?
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.720]   So this type of fool is Naval.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.120]   Like Nabal and Abigail.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   Exactly.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.840]   Yeah, that's the exact same word.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.800]   And so there, the fool is a wicked fool, and we translate it as such.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   We said the wicked fool has said in his heart or says in his heart, there is no God.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.000]   And so this is the type of fool who rejects the presence of God.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.860]   He sees the things around him.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.280]   He understands the things around him and the complexity of them, but he says there is no
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.360]   God.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   And this is the wickedness of the fool coming out in its nuance.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.660]   And so when we translated and we see all of these references to fools, we wanted to make
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.840]   sure that the difference and the nuance and the distinction between them comes out.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.240]   And so we made that evident in the translation.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   Another thing we made evident in the translation is acrostics.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:23.880]   I think some translations, a lot of translations do that for Psalm 119, but there are other
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.760]   passages involved too, Joe, explain to us the nature of an acrostic.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560]   I'm kind of getting ahead of myself here.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.120]   Tell us what an acrostic is and then tell us where else it happens in the Old Testament
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   and such.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.560]   Well, if I forget where else it happens, please remind me, but Psalm 119 is a common passage
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.760]   we refer to when we see an acrostic, but what's an acrostic?
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:52.360]   An acrostic is when you start each verse or each line of poetry or a stanza with the letter
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.160]   of the alphabet in the order of the alphabet.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.660]   So you look at Psalm 119, the famous one, the first stanza begins with Aleph because
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.920]   Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.600]   The next stanza begins with Bet because the next letter is Bet and Gimel, Dalet, et cetera.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.720]   And so it follows the order of the alphabet from Aleph until Tath, from the very beginning
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.260]   until the very end.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.760]   And we already said that Psalm 119 is one of the famous ones, but it's not the only
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   one.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.300]   There are other passages in the Bible where it appears and sometimes, or I should say
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.360]   many times commentaries refer to it and they bring this out, not always, but many times.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.960]   And I think sometimes other translations make reference to it, but again, not always, but
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.400]   we do see it in other places.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.560]   So you think about lamentations, right?
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.660]   Lamentations one, chapter one, chapter two, chapter three, chapter four, all of those
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.580]   have their own acrostic from Aleph until Tath.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.140]   And you see it all throughout the Psalms.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.400]   You have it in Psalm nine and 10 where it begins in Psalm nine and then it runs into
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.760]   Psalm 10 and it ends in Psalm 10.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:06.260]   You have it in Psalm 37, for example, that you preached on a little while back.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.500]   - Yeah, I call that one the ABCs of someone who's been through their one, two, threes.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:19.080]   It's writing Psalm 37 as an older individual, and he's writing the different, each line,
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.760]   each verse is a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.180]   And it's walking through the most basic things in life in a memorable way.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.620]   That's what acrostics often do.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.440]   They show completeness, they show memorability.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.820]   And he's reminding us, teaching us the life lessons we need to know from an older person
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.120]   to someone who is about to experience life.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   - Yeah.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   And I think that's exactly it.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.520]   It goes to the meaning of the acrostics, right?
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.000]   They're not just there for aesthetics.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.200]   Of course, they bring beauty to the Psalm or to the poem, but there's much more.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.240]   There's exegesis, there's theology behind it.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.680]   And I think that this actually goes to a question that may be taken for granted sometimes, that
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.240]   the acrostic is there because the author of the biblical text intended it for it to be
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   there.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.560]   And if the author intended it for it to be there, then it's inspired because God used
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.280]   the author to write the biblical text.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.040]   And I think that we're going to have a section somewhere in the introduction where it's called
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.840]   "Acrostics and Authorial Intent," right?
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.320]   Because we want to explain that this is not just there by accident.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:28.040]   It's actually there because the author's intended so that we get the theology from the acrostic
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   as well.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:37.680]   And order or the ABCs or the completion of the idea is all of it that comes out from
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.280]   the acrostic that is within the Psalm.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.520]   And actually, if you think about Psalm 9 and 10, this is the interesting one.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.320]   This is two Psalms, and the acrostic begins in Psalm 9, but then it stops at, I think,
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.460]   letter Kaf, which is actually exactly halfway through the alphabet.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.960]   And then it picks up in Psalm 10 and then completes the acrostic in Psalm 10.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.840]   And for this reason, you look at some of the translations, you look at the Greek translation,
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.920]   you look at the Latin translation, and they put those two Psalms together.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.640]   Because of the acrostic, there's other things.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.260]   Of course, there's theme and ideas within the two Psalms, so they bring them together.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.440]   But that's what the acrostic does.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.060]   It shows completion.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.360]   It shows a step-by-step instruction of how to fulfill something.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.000]   And you preached on this in Psalm 37, as you said, and it was, you know, this is something
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.720]   that helps us interpret the biblical text as well.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.120]   Yeah, and that, I think, goes back to our translation philosophy, which is to be a window
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.880]   into what the author intended, what the author designed.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   And the more we can reflect that, whether by what we talked about earlier with macro
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:45.480]   syntactical markers, or to reflecting a word so that we study it more according to the
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.640]   author's intent, like loving kindness, or just bringing out that there are different
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.920]   words for fool, or even that there's an acrostic present in the text and we identified all
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.740]   the acrostics and labeled them as such so that the reader will know this is what the
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.740]   author did.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.600]   It's a window back to what the author wanted.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.580]   And that's kind of, that is, the reigning theme and philosophy and drive behind the
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:14.000]   whole Legacy Standard Bible and the entire Old Testament by extension, of course.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.880]   And so thanks, Joe, for this time.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.360]   Thanks for answering some questions with me, and I hope it's been very edifying for you.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360]   Thank you.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   Thanks, Joe.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   Thank you.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
