[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Easter Sunday is a glorious day to celebrate the victory of Christ.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.300]   It's my favorite day of the year.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.000]   And then Monday arrives and we again face all the struggles of our
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400]   fallen and unresurrected world.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.200]   And, uh, this includes the struggles that are very close to home, the struggles
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.280]   that are even inside of our homes.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.160]   One man, a husband and a father writes in to ask this.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.560]   Pastor John, I am a Christian.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.840]   My wife is not.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.400]   When we met and married in medical school, nine years ago, I held
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.720]   firmly to atheism and relativism.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.760]   She was Buddhist.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   Five years ago, God opened the eyes of my heart to see, experience, and
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.660]   know the truth of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.840]   Like Nebuchadnezzar, God brought me low.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.520]   And from those depths, I arose in awe and praise.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.840]   However, these last several years have been challenging for my marriage.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.760]   Despite sharing two young sons together, my wife and I are spiritually at odds.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.160]   Despite my attempts to explain, she does not understand my faith in Christ, nor my
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160]   time spent in Bible reading and prayer.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.440]   My time at church on Sundays is often viewed as a distraction from our family life.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.880]   I love my wife immensely.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200]   I love our experience of each other caring for our sons.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.640]   I believe those joys are pointers to an experience of God's joy.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.920]   She does not.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.000]   I feel like there's a spiritual divorce of sorts that has already happened.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.640]   I have no intention.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   I have no intention of a legal divorce.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.160]   I want to keep alive the hope that we will one day share a Christ exalting
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.480]   marriage and lead our sons in a walk of faith.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.140]   But how do I persevere in love, empathy, and in a Christ-centered way amidst this
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.880]   great spiritual divide with my wife?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.600]   Oh my.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.200]   I want our friend who doesn't give us his name to know that I have prayed, not
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920]   just for him in his request, but for her.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.120]   This is a beautiful testimony.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.600]   God brought me low and from those depths I arose in awe and praise.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.760]   That is a beautiful testimony of a beautiful act of sovereign
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.600]   grace and a powerful one.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.280]   And I thank God for it.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.960]   It's also beautiful because he says, I love my wife immensely.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.200]   I love our experience of caring for our two sons.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.280]   I believe those joys are pointers to an experience of God's joy.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.200]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.240]   And it's beautiful because he wants help in persevering in love.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.000]   All that is pure, amazing, supernatural, miraculous, divine work.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.640]   And I praise God for it.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.160]   I stand in awe of God's power in this man's life.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.840]   What a great testimony.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.200]   And it's a painful testimony.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   She does not understand my faith in Jesus or my time spent in Bible reading and
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.560]   prayer, sometimes she views my church involvement as a distraction from family
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.040]   life.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.800]   I feel like there's a spiritual divorce of sorts, but oh, how I thank God that our
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.400]   friend has not done what so many do, namely equate that internal breakdown
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.760]   with a justification for divorce.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.320]   He says, I have no intention of legal divorce.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   I want to keep alive the hope that we will one day share a Christ exalting
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   marriage and lead our sons to walk in faith.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.560]   Amen.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.720]   Amen.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.520]   God is so pleased with that resolve and Lord make it happen.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.200]   So in answer to the question, how can I persevere?
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.520]   How can I endure in love and empathy in a Christ-centered way amidst this kind of
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.240]   spiritual divorce of heart, if not marriage?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.800]   Now I'm going to try to answer with some passages of scripture because the key to
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   persevering will be hope and faith that God can overcome this divide and this
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.560]   faith and hope are all built on the word of God.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.920]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and we need God to speak to us
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.080]   every day.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.040]   That's what this man needs.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.280]   Every day he needs God to speak to him, not just once in a while, in order to give
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:45.480]   him grace and perseverance, but the word becomes effective through divine work in
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.600]   our hearts in response to prayer.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.160]   So I'm going to start there in 2 Thessalonians 3 verse 5.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   May the Lord direct your hearts.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.440]   I'm saying this to him now.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.600]   May the Lord direct your heart to the love of God and the steadfastness, the
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.120]   endurance of Christ.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.160]   This is Paul's prayer that the Lord would direct our hearts.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.640]   This is what our friend will need more than anything, namely God.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.560]   The almighty God must do heart work on him, heart directing.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.840]   I pray this often for myself.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.000]   The love of God and the steadfastness of Christ are essential for being steadfast
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.920]   in marriage, but the Lord must direct our hearts to the love of God and direct our
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.240]   hearts to the steadfastness of Christ.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:54.560]   So this is the great foundational need, a heart, a sovereign heart directing work of
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.200]   God.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.400]   So we join Paul in praying for that day in and day out.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.120]   Oh God, direct my heart to what I need in your word.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:13.520]   Direct my heart through your word to the reality that I need for strength.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:22.120]   And it is a wonderful encouragement that virtually all of the Bible is designed to
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.720]   encourage endurance and hope.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.600]   Listen, listen to Romans 15, 4 to 6.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.960]   Whatever was written, whatever, all of it, whatever was written in former days was
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:44.200]   written for our instruction that through endurance and through the encouragement of
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.520]   the scriptures.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.360]   So I think that means the endurance and the encouragement that scriptures give, we
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   might have hope.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.480]   May the God of endurance and the God of encouragement grant you to live in such
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:04.920]   harmony with one another, sweet marriage verse, with no distortion of meaning, such
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.640]   harmony with one another in accord with Christ that together you may with one voice
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.360]   glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.760]   Now that is a beautiful passage that without any twisting can be applied to
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.960]   marriage.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.840]   That together you may with one voice glorify God.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.320]   That's his heart's desire for his marriage.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560]   And that's what this text is about.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.480]   And it's all about hope from scriptures, hope based on endurance and encouragement
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.680]   that come from the scriptures.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.120]   And the way it does this is by acquainting us with the God of endurance and the God of
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.400]   encouragement through the scriptures.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:55.040]   One of the hardest challenges for him will be not just to endure and persevere, but to
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.080]   do so with joy.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:06.800]   We want our children and our unbelieving spouses to see that Jesus satisfies and that
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.280]   we don't just gut out the life he's given us to live, but that in it, with all of its
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.120]   sorrows, there is profound joy.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.560]   So here's the way Paul prays in Colossians 1, 9 and 11.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.000]   "And so from the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.240]   (now I'm jumping to verse 11) be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.680]   might, for all endurance and patience with joy."
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.440]   This is God's great miracle work in answer to prayer.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.720]   May God strengthen you according to his glorious might for all endurance and patience
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.360]   with joy.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.320]   Nobody but God can do that in a difficult marriage.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.840]   Let me just quickly give two other passages that come at it from two different ways.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.720]   Marriage is like a marathon, not a sprint.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.760]   It's a marathon.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.240]   And some marathons have more hills, more heat, more obstacles than other marathons.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.920]   And here's how Jesus ran his marathon and calls us to run the marathon of our marriage
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.640]   and every other marathon that we face.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.560]   "Since we are surrounded," this is Hebrews 12, 1 and 2, "Since we are surrounded by so
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.040]   great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.520]   closely and let us run with endurance."
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.080]   That's what he's asking for.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.040]   Perseverance, the race that is set before us.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.880]   And here comes how?
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.160]   Looking to Jesus.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.120]   "The founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.040]   the cross."
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:59.080]   So don't be ashamed of looking forward to the future joy to experience portions of it in
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.720]   the present to sustain you in your marathon of marriage.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.520]   And the last text, this is one of the most crucial because it relates the suffering of
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.800]   such a marriage to hope and the endurance.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.560]   Romans 5, 3, even the suffering and the difficulties are meant to help us persevere.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.960]   It says, "We rejoice in our sufferings," and just add marriage, "our sufferings in
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.160]   marriage, knowing that suffering produces endurance or perseverance and endurance
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.840]   produces a sense of approveness and approveness produces hope and hope won't let
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.960]   you be ashamed because the love of God is poured out into your heart through the Holy
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.400]   Spirit."
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:48.120]   So I end where I began with that amazing statement of the source of our daily need
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.480]   for renewed hope, namely Romans 15, 4.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:58.120]   Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction that through the
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.920]   endurance, the perseverance, and through the encouragement of the scriptures, we might
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.520]   have hope.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.000]   Yeah, beautiful.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.720]   Thank you, Pastor John, for all of that biblical hope for endurance.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.600]   And thanks for listening to this episode.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.400]   You can find our audio feeds, you can browse and search all of our past episodes, and
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.360]   you can send us a question of your own all online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.240]   And speaking of marriage, next time we're going to look at male headship in the home.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.880]   Is this structure in the home a dated and obsolete cultural custom or is it true today?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.640]   And even if it is biblical, is it now a lost cause within the church?
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.280]   Those are some of the blunt questions that are on the docket for Wednesday.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.840]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we will see you then.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:55.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
