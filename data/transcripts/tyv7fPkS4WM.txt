[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention are to be found in the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The seventeenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   We still are examining and considering this most important statement that is found here in the very prologue to the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And we are giving this time to it because it is one of these crucial points in the whole understanding of the way of salvation.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We have seen already that it governs every step and stage in that salvation.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The beginning, the very conviction, justification, sanctification, our whole view of salvation is very largely determined,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   as we have seen in various ways, by this whole matter of the relationship between law and grace, or if you prefer it, between Moses and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now, we have been at pains to emphasize two chief things.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   One is that the law must not be dismissed.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   That is one of the misunderstandings.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   There are various ways in which people dismiss the law as if it were irrelevant and that we need not be concerned about it at all.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And that therefore we have been wrong even in giving it the attention that we have been giving the last Sunday mornings.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But then on the other hand, and this is what we saw in particular last Sunday morning,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   there is the danger, as it were, of making too much of the law, misunderstanding it in the sense of expecting too much of it,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   expecting of it something that it was never intended to give, nor to supply, nor to do.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And we saw the complete fallacy of that procedure, especially as it shone in the case of the Jews,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   both in the Old Testament and at the time of our Lord, during the preaching of the apostles in the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and how this has militated prominently ever since in the minds of men and women.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Well now then, the way that we have been able to do all that has been this.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   We have considered what is the real function of the law.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Why was it ever given?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Why is it important that we should never forget that the law was given by Moses,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   in other words, given by God through the medium of angels to Moses,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   that he in turn might pass it on to the children of Israel?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And we have seen that it was meant to do this.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It was meant to reveal God to us, and the character of God, and the holiness of God, and our relationship to God.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It was meant likewise to reveal God's demands of us,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   to show what it is that God expects of men,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   in order to bring him to a state of conviction,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and to show him his need of what God alone can give him.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It was likewise meant, for the same end of course, to bring out the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   that sin is not something light and superficial, but deep, down in the very depths of our being.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   The exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And that in turn led us to the point at which we arrived last time,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   namely that we are entirely and completely hopeless and helpless for these various reasons.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So we were able to end last Sunday morning on this note,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   that the real business and function of the law is to be our schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It was never intended to be a way of salvation. Never.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It was always intended to be our schoolmaster, our pedagogue, to lead us and to bring us to Christ.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Or, to use the other term the apostle uses in Galatians 3,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   it was meant to shut us in and to shut us up unto Christ.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   To shut every door, every way of exit and of escape, and to hold us there face to face with him.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Very well then.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   We are now in a position therefore to make this assertion,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   that the most important thing to grasp about the law is that it is a pointer, a finger post to grace.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That is the point at which we have arrived, and this is a fundamental assertion.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The law points to grace.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Moses points to the Lord Jesus Christ, and indicates to us why he had to come.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   In other words, there is no better prolegomena, if you like, or introduction to the gospel than the law.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That is what its function really is.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It is the introduction to grace, to the gospel, to the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, we are on the doorstep, as it were, of the season of Advent.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And that is the way to approach it. That is precisely, of course, what John is doing here.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   He is at the beginning of his gospel. He is really telling us how the word was made flesh, and in this verse.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And in connection with the law, he tells us why the word ever was made flesh.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And I will go further, why the word had to be made flesh, if man really was to be delivered and to be saved.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Now then, that is the essence of the relationship between the law and grace, between Moses and Christ.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   So that you see why I have been at such pains, to impress the point that we must never regard them as opposites.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Now that is the tendency. Law, grace, extreme opposites.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And that they have nothing to do with one another, that we know as Christians dismiss law.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Now, what I am just saying, and in bringing out this relationship between the two,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   as the law, as the schoolmaster, as the introduction, as the preparation,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   well, you see how entirely and utterly wrong it is to regard them as opposites.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And how still more wrong it is to dismiss the law.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And how still more wrong again it is to overestimate the function of the law,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and to rely upon it, and to regard it as a means, or as a way of salvation.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The vestibule is not the house, the introduction is not the main thing itself,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   the preliminary is not the actuality.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   There is this relationship. They must never be separated.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Neither must the law be exalted into a central position as a means of salvation and of deliverance.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Very well. Here then we have arrived at this most important point.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   That the law points to Christ, shuts us up to Christ.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   That is its function. That is what the law can do, that is what the law must do.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But that is the utmost of what it can do.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Now, you remember that phrase we looked at last week in Romans 8, 3, what the law could not do.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's all right. There we see the limit of what it can do.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It can do certain things, but then beyond that it cannot.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Well, now, let us once more look at this relationship between the law and grace,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   in the light of this idea that the law is the introduction to, the pointer to grace.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And let us illustrate this in different ways.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   The first is this.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   The law actually, in and of itself, did point to grace.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I mean by that, that even when it was given, when it was first given to Moses through the medium of angels,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   in and of itself the law as God gave it to Moses contained within itself this element of grace.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Now, where do we see that? Well, we see it here, of course.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And it is something that we should never forget.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   God not merely gave to Moses the Ten Commandments and the moral law.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   He gave him at the same time what is called the ceremonial law.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It is all part and parcel of the same revelation, the same preparation.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And there you read a lot about burnt offerings and meal offerings and sacrifices,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and the blood of bulls and of goats, and then you read about the ashes of a heifer,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and various washings and lustrations, and so on.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Now, people very often try to read the end of the book of Exodus and the book of Leviticus and parts of Numbers,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and they say, "I can't understand all this. I don't know what it's all about.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Has it got anything to do with me? Is it just some particular details about the children of Israel at that time,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   very largely a matter of public health laws or something like that?"
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   People are confused by all this.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And of course the answer to the confusion is simply to realize the object and the purpose of all that.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And it is, as I say, just to show the absolute need and necessity of grace.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Because the provision of these things indicates that God himself was teaching those children of Israel
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   as to the only way in which they could approach him.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He's told them that they are his people, that he demands a certain type of conduct and behavior from them,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   and then he provides all this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And in this he is providing them with a way to enter into his presence.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But the thing that I'm emphasizing is that it is God himself who provides it.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   They didn't imagine these things.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Moses didn't invent these things.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Moses was taken up into the mount, and all this was revealed to him in detail.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And he was told to go down and to do all things according to the pattern that had been shown him in the mount.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So that there is a very real significance in all these things that he was told and all that he had to do,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   and the children of Israel had to carry out.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And the ultimate meaning of it all is this, that this is the way in which God is to be approached.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   But there's something else in there.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And that is there is a clear indication of the need of forgiveness.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Why do they have to take these animals?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Why do they have to put their hands on the head of the bull?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And why must he be slain and his blood collected and then presented by the high priest?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   What's the meaning of it all?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Why does a lamb have to be slain morning and evening and presented?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   What's the purpose? What's the object?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   There is only one answer. This is the way in which God tells them that they need forgiveness.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And you notice that it is God himself who provides the way and the means and the method.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Now that's all grace.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But you see, all that is a part of the law.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   That is where this putting of law and grace as complete antithesis is always wrong.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   There is grace in the law.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   The law, at any rate, indicates the need of grace.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   It is a part of its own message.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And so it is interesting to observe how there in all this ceremonial,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   the children of Israel are being told and reminded of the fact that ultimately
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   they are dependent upon the grace of God.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   They've been given the commandments, these are the things to do.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And yet at the same time God says, "Well now then, as it were, as you will fail to do them,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   here is my provision."
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And they had to carry out the details of that ceremonial law.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So that there we find in and of itself that the law contains this element of grace, but still more.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   The law in a prophetic manner points to grace.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And it does that like this.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It makes it quite plain and clear that all these burnt offerings and sacrifices
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and everything to which I have referred, that all this was not something in and of itself.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   These, we are told, are but types.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   These are but shadows.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   They perform a function, yes, but their main function is to point to something that is yet coming.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   These are all, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it so plainly and clearly,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   simply for the time being.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Now that is the great point that is made about them everywhere.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   They were simply for the time being.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   You'll find rich teaching about that in chapter 7 and 9 of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Here it is, for instance, in the ninth verse of the ninth chapter,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   which was a figure for the time then present,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   as pertaining to the conscience,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   imposed on them until the time of reformation.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Now that's a very perfect summing up of it all.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   All these are for the time being.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   They are simply sufficient until.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Now that's what I mean by this prophetic element.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   The paschal lamb that was slain when the children of Israel were about to leave Egypt for Canaan,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   and his blood painted on the doorpost and the lintel of the house of the children of Israel,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   that is something in and of itself, yes,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   but its main function is to point to the Lamb of God that's going to come.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And so, with every single burnt offering and sacrifice and every provision that's ever been made,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   they're all of them pointing, indicating, showing that still there is the great antitype to come.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   They're the shadow, not the substance.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   They're the preparation, not the reality itself.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So that you see the law thus points to grace in a prophetic manner.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It says this is the arrangement for the time being, but,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and there you have Moses pointing to Christ, you have the law pointing to grace.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Now one of the great errors, indeed the greatest error of all of the children of Israel,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   was that they so constantly failed to remember that.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And they tended to regard their offerings and sacrifices as something in and of themselves.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   They regarded them as something that really completed the work,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and that as long as they'd taken their offering and their sacrifice,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   there was nothing more to be done.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And the result is, you see, that you get the constant protest of the prophets against that.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Now this is something that has been often misunderstood.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And the so-called higher critics of the Old Testament have made a great deal of this.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   They have said that there was a feud and a warfare between the priests and the prophets.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   They say the proof of that is that the prophets keep on saying,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   "I don't want your burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is not the thing that I told you to do when I brought you out at the beginning."
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And you get the great statements likewise in certain prophetic psalms,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   such as Psalm 49 and 50, in which God says, "The cattle and a thousand hills are mine.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I don't need your offerings and your sacrifices."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And from that they deduce that there was this opposition,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   complete opposition, between the priest and the prophet.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   But of course that is a complete misunderstanding.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   What the prophets are saying is this.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   God certainly ordained these offerings and sacrifices,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   but he never said that they were sufficient in and of themselves.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He never said that they completed the work.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   He never said that they were a substitute for heart worship,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and a real submission to him, and a real obedience to him.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Now that was what they were doing.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   You see, they said, "Obedience doesn't matter very much.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It doesn't matter what I do as long as I take my burnt offering and sacrifice.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   That will put it all right and God will be well pleased."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   That's the thing that the prophets denounce.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And you see the importance and the relevance of that for us.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   That is our habitual Protestant criticism of Roman Catholicism,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and every other form of Catholicism, isn't it?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   That they argue like this, "Do what you like, but go and confess it to the priest.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You're all right. It doesn't matter what you do.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   As long as you confess, as long as you take your offering and your sacrifice,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   all is well."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   In the same way we as Protestants are guilty like this.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   We think that good acts balance bad acts.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   That if we are generous in contributions to funds,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   it covers our deficiencies in other respects.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   That's to put your reliance upon the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   To regard them as acting as it were ex opere operato,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   which is the false view of sacraments.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   It is to believe that there is magic in the water, magic in the bread and the wine,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   magic in any good act, that it automatically sets us free.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   But the answer to that is this, that all this is simply a pointer to Christ and to grace.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It never must be regarded in and of itself as efficient.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So that I'm arguing that the law contained all this immediately.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It said you need forgiveness.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   You need God to provide a way of forgiveness.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   You are waiting.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   This just covers your sin for the time being.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   But you're kept, you're waiting for something, someone who is yet to come.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Thus in and of itself the law pointed to grace.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   And indeed there was a very specific statement that God gave Moses to give to the children of Israel.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It's in Deuteronomy 18, 15.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Listen to this.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Unto him ye shall hearken."
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   There is Moses, the one to whom and through whom the law was given, saying,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   "This is all right, but I am simply pointing to this other prophet that is to come."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   He is the one to whom to listen.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Very well.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   There's our first point, but let me make a second.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   The law not only did this in and of itself, but it did it likewise in its teaching, in its implications.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And this is the most important matter.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I mean in the first place that the law shows us the need of grace.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And that is where any notion that we can ever justify ourselves by works or by keeping the law is so absolutely fatal.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   The law, I say, shows us the absolute need of grace.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   How? Well, like this.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   The law of God tells us that it must be honored because it is God's law.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   The moment we realize the meaning of the law, we see that it is something that has got to be honored in every detail.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   The moment a man really understands the law, he ceases to talk about goodness.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   He ceases to be interested in good and kind deeds and actions, important though they are.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   He realizes that the law of God is an absolute demand,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and that God will be content with nothing less than an absolute, 100% fulfillment.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   You remember our Lord himself puts this so clearly in the Sermon on the Mount, in that crucial verse, Matthew 5, 17.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   "Think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the Lord till all be fulfilled."
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Now, there is the key statement in this respect, and a very vital one it is.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   The law is the law of God.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It isn't our idea of righteousness or decency or goodness that matters.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's God's demand and God's request, and it's an absolute demand.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And there it is thundering to us, "This do, and thou shalt live."
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And at once it makes us see that we are all guilty.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   We are all condemned before God.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Now, you see, this is always the introduction to the Gospel.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   You get it perhaps in one of its most classic statements in the third chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This is how Paul introduces the Gospel of the Romans.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Verse 19, "Now we know that what thing soever the law saith,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and all the world may become guilty before God.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   for by the law is the knowledge of sin, it convicts, it shows our failure."
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   But then here comes the Gospel, "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   being witnessed by the law and the prophets."
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   You see, the law and the prophets witness to the Gospel.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   "The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   For there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Now there is a perfect statement of this very point.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   This whole relationship between law, prophets, and grace.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And the main point is this, that the law by its teaching and its implications
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   shows us the utter absolute need of grace.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   "For we are all sinners, we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one. The whole world lieth guilty before God."
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   The law makes me see that I need to be forgiven by God.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And that is its great function and its work.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And this is always the first point in conviction.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   This is the essential preliminary to any real understanding of the whole doctrine of salvation.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   That I am a failure, that I am guilty, that I need to be forgiven.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   In other words, as the hymn puts it,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   "I am guilty, I am helpless, I am lost.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Here I am, nothing in my hands I bring.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I am helpless, I am hopeless, I need to be washed, so I fly to the fountain.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Helpless, look to thee for grace."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   You see, helplessness is an introduction to grace.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Very well, then, here it is, "I am guilty, I need to be forgiven."
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   That's the first thing that we see and deduce about the teaching of the law as an introduction to grace.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   But then let me put the second thing.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   The law in the same way in its teaching shows abundantly clearly
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   that nothing but grace can save us and suffice us.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Now then, here again, of course, is this great crucial matter.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Here is really the origin of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   This is the big thing, this whole doctrine of grace.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   This was the grand rediscovery that was made by Luther and the rest in the sixteenth century.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Now, the point I am concerned to emphasize is this, that there is nothing
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that so demonstrates and proves to the hilt our complete and entire dependence upon grace
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   as the law of God.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   That is why I say it is the introduction to grace, and indeed it is the one introduction.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Now, the whole trouble which so many people find and encounter in this whole question of Christian salvation
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   is very largely due to the fact that a true law work has never been done in them.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   They have never fully understood this teaching concerning the law.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   But once the law has done its work upon a man, it makes him see that nothing but grace can possibly save him.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Now, here is this great contention that you saw made there in that second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   You see, his great point, he keeps on repeating it, is this, "By grace are ye saved."
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   He goes on repeating that, you remember, "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ in brackets. By grace ye are saved,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   that in the ages to come ye might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   not of works, lest any man should burst. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Now then, why does the apostle make so much of that? Why does he go on repeating this,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   "By grace ye are saved," and the negative, "not by works," and so on, and then the final, "We are his workmanship."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Well, he's just establishing this great fact, that our salvation is only and entirely because of the grace of God.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Now, I say this is absolutely fundamental and crucial.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Anybody who is not a Christian in this congregation at this moment is in that condition, certainly for this reason,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   that he or she is still relying upon himself or herself, or your goodness, or your works, or your deeds, in some shape or form.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   The stumbling block is grace. You see, grace means that we get it for nothing, that we can do nothing.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   But that's the thing we don't like. We feel there is value in our goodness.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   We feel that surely there is some point in our being moral.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   We say, "Are you telling us that we have always been brought up in a church, and have always lived a good and a religious life,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   that we are in the identical position of the worst blackguard in London this morning who has never been in a chapel?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Are we in the same position?"
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   The gospel says, "Yes, you are. There is no difference. None at all."
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   "What do you say?" "All my reading of the Bible."
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   The Bible says, "No value in it if you are relying upon it."
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   "All the good I have done? Useless, filthy rags, worthless."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   You see, it is the great preaching of the New Testament.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Now, that was the stumbling block with the Jews, Oliver's.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   They couldn't believe this.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   The idea that they and the Gentiles were in the same case, and equally dependent upon the grace of God.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   They felt it was an insult. They felt it was mockery of God's own law given to his people.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   They protested. They regarded Christ as a blasphemer because he taught that.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   They couldn't follow this.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   The Gentiles to them were not only pagans, they were dogs.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Strangers from the covenants of promise, outside the covenant, without God in the world.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   How can they be in the same position as God's own people, the godly Jews, the religious Jews?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And yet, as I've shown you from the quotation from Romans 3,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   the apostles' whole argument is that there is no difference.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   "There is no difference," he says, "for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God."
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Every one is reduced to a common denominator.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Now, then, what is it that proves that?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Well, the answer is, it's the law that proves it.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   That's the whole argument the whole time.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   It is the law that shows us our utter hopelessness and helplessness.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And if we haven't seen it, it's because we haven't understood the law.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   The law hasn't done its work upon us. The schoolmaster hasn't really taught us.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   That is where law is so absolutely essential still.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   It is the one thing that makes us realize that we are utterly dependent upon grace.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   How does it do it? Well, we've already seen it.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Let me just remind you hurriedly of it. What we've seen is this.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   We are not only guilty in the sight of God,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   but we are completely without strength, completely helpless, and therefore completely hopeless.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   The apostle gives an amazing summary of it here in this second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   What's the truth about you? Well, he says, the truth about you is this.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   That we are all living according to the course of this world.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   We are dominated by the devil.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   We are all, among whom we all had our conversation in times past,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And we're by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   That's where you were, says the apostle.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   That's where everybody is. He puts himself, you notice, in with them.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   We are all guilty before God, but we are not only guilty, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   We are debased.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   We are perverted.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   We are governed by these lusts, as he called them, which are not only in the flesh, but also in the mind.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   You see, we can't get out of this. We are all the creatures of lust.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Somebody says, I've never committed adultery. I've never committed murder. That's lust.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   It is lust, I agree, but desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Temper, anger is a lust, quite as much as the other.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Jealousy and envy and spite and ambition, these are lusts.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   These are the things that keep people awake at night.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   They can't sleep. That means you're governed by it and controlled by it. That's a lust.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And we are all guilty of these things, every one of us.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   We are not only guilty, but we are perverted.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Our very natures are rotten.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   But it's even worse than that.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   We are all dead.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   "Ye were thee quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins."
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Dead, spiritually dead.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Do you know God?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Is God real to you? If he isn't, it's because you're dead.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   You say, I've lived a very good life. All right, I'm not asking you that.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   The question is, are you spiritually alive?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Do you know God? Do you love God?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   There's a sign of life. Love.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   The little infant loves the parent.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   It hasn't got much understanding, but instinctively it loves.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So does the person who is alive spiritually.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   So the test we apply to ourselves is this.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Do we know God? Do we know the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Are they real to us? Do we love God?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   That's his own test.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And if we don't, it means we are spiritually dead.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And what's the point of all your good works and deeds when you are dead?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   They're all artificial flowers.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   There's no life in them. There is no value in them.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   The apostle came to see this himself.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   All that he trusted in, he says, "I saw that it was dung and loss,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   that I may win Christ and be found in him,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   but the righteousness which is of God by faith."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   No, then, it's the law that opens our eyes to that.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Not of works, because our works are never sufficient.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   God demands absolute perfection.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Well, here we are, then. I am guilty. I am helpless.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   I am weak. I am hopeless.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I am here. I can do nothing.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   If I spend the rest of my life fasting and sweating in a monastery,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   in a cell, and living a religious life, so-called,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I'll be none the better at the end.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   That's what Luther had to discover.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And it is the law that brings that out.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   The law shows us the complete hopelessness of everything we do.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   There it is, as we saw, summarized so perfectly in the seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I, with the mind, I see the value of the law of God, I want to do it,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   but then this other law in the members, and I'm paralyzed.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I'm a contradiction. I don't do what I want to do, and I do what I don't want to do.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And here I am, oh, wretched man that I am.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   That's the cry for grace. That's it.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   There's the law pointing to grace. It puts me flat on my back.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I can't stir. I can't move.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I'm dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   I can do nothing.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   There, I say, the law proves the utter, absolute necessity of grace before I can be saved.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Very well, so the third point I make is this one.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   The law, by its teaching, defines what grace is.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   What is grace?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Grace is the free, unmerited favor of God.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Grace is kindness shown to the utterly undeserving.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   That's the meaning of grace.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Grace says that salvation is entirely due to God and because of what God is.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   It is all the result of God's nature.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It is nothing in me, nothing at all in me.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   So if I try to bring in anything of myself, I'm denying grace.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   There have been many who have done that.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   That's the whole tragedy of Roman Catholic teaching, its so-called synergism.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   They talk a lot about grace.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   They even say it's in the water with which a child is baptized.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   They say it's in the bread that becomes transubstantiated and in the wine and so on.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Transmissible grace, yes, but they also insist upon your good works.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   They insist upon it.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   They call it synergism, working together with.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I've got to work with grace.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   No, no, that's a denial of grace.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Grace means that it is altogether and entirely due to God.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   That salvation is of God from beginning to end.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   That I make no contribution at all, but surely say my believing does it.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   No, no, if you say that your believing saves you, you're denying grace.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And do you still want to do that, having seen that you were dead?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Can the dead do anything?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   We're not told that we're very ill.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   We're told we were dead in trespasses and sins, and dead means dead.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   The dead can do nothing.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Therefore it must be all of God, and it is all of God.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Not of works, lest any man should boast.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Turn your faith into works, you're denying grace.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   No, no, says Paul, by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It is the gift of God.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   We make no contribution whatsoever to our salvation.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   The law teaches me that.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   It shows me that I can't make any contribution.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   If my best contribution is as filthy rags, if my best contribution is as dung, what's the value of it?
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   In any case, I'm dead, spiritually dead.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   The law proves to me the nature of grace.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And grace is, I say, the free, unmerited favor of God.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   The apostle, therefore, describes it at length.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   You see, we need to have life put into us.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   We need to be quickened, like the child in the womb.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   It doesn't do anything about it. It is quickened.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   You hath he quickened together with Christ.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   By grace he has saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Why? That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   What does this grace mean? It means this.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   That our salvation is entirely due to God's own nature.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   It is because he is kind, it is because he is love, it is because there is no limit to his graciousness.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   That's why he's done it.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Now let's be clear about this.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   God sent his Son into this world not as a response to our cry.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   No, no. He even created the cry within us.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   God doesn't respond to us.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   It's God who causes us to respond to him.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   It's God who acts first, last, always.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   It is entirely and altogether of God.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Grace means that we are saved not because of anything that's in us.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   We are saved in spite of everything that is true of us.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   That's what grace means.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   That it is altogether of God.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It is his love, his kindness, his compassion, his mercy, this grace of his, the exceeding riches.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   God was moved by nothing in our salvation except his own glorious nature.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   And that is grace.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Well, let me give you another great statement of all this,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   as it's to be found in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, beginning at verse 6.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   For scarcely for a righteous man will one die,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   But listen. "For if when we were anemias, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   much more being reconciled, we shall be saved in his life." That's the truth about us.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Guilty, perverted, anemias, hating God, even dead, helpless, hopeless, lifeless,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   in that condition God has done it all. That's his grace.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And the thing that establishes all this that is so true about us
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   is the law of God given through Moses to the children of Israel,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   the law that was originally written in the heart of man.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   The law defines grace.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   It must be altogether and entirely in God and of God,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   because there is nothing left in me to do it.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   And so lastly, we find that grace predicts and indicates, that law indicates and predicts,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   what the grace of God in Christ does for us, what it must do for us.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   In other words, the law anticipates for us prophetically what the message of the gospel must be.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And this is very wonderful to me.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Do you want to know what the gospel of Jesus Christ is? I can tell you.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   What does the law say I need first and foremost?
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   The answer is forgiveness.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   The gospel announces the forgiveness.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Does the law stop at that? Does it say that I only need forgiveness?
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   No, it doesn't.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   For the law not only convicts me of my guilt, it shows me that my nature, as I say,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   is twisted and perverted and rotten.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   It shows that there is no good thing in me.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   It shows that I am dead.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   So what must I get in the gospel? What is the gospel going to give me?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Oh, forgiveness first, but then new birth, new nature, new creation.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   And the gospel proclaims it, but the law has demanded it.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   The law has pointed to this gift of grace that is essential,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   because I need not only to be forgiven, I need to be able to dwell with God and to walk with God
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   and to commune with God and to obey God.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And I need a new nature that will love the light and hate the darkness,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   instead of the nature which I have, which loves the darkness and hates the light.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   So the law prophesies that that will be the second element in the gospel preaching, and it is.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And the third and the last thing is my need of power.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   I now see the meaning of the law and its spiritual character,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   but how to perform that which is good I know not.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I have got the new nature now, I have got understanding, but then how to do?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   So I am told that I need some power within me,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   and the gospel tells me that the Spirit of God will come and dwell in me,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and will be a power in me unto him that is able to do exceeding abundant
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   above all that we can ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, it is God that worketh in you,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Very well then, here we see this most interesting relationship between the law and grace,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   between Moses and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Don't separate them, my friends, don't regard them as antitheses,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   don't kick away the law.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   No, no, you see how essential it is.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   It points to grace, it points to Christ, it points to the gospel,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   it shows me my utter absolute need of grace,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   and then it shows me the grace of God in Christ,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   and what the gift of his grace is.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Pardoned, healed, restored, forgiven, reconciled to God, made a child of God.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   The Spirit of God dwelling in me as a tabernacle,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   and working in me mightily, and preparing me ultimately for the presence of God,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   for the perfection of him, and the holiness of his holy presence.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   The law was given by Moses.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   The law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   The law shuts us up unto Christ.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   The law is the introduction to Christ.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   The law calls for grace, anticipates it,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   and leads me to submit myself utterly and completely to it.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   For being dead I must be quickened,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and it is God who creates within me the very realization of my need.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Let not conscience make you linger, or of fitness fondly dream.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   All the fitness he requireth is to see your need of him.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   This he gives you is the Spirit's rising beam.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   We are completely dead.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Our salvation is entirely and only and absolutely and all in all of God.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   By grace are ye saved.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Glory be to God and his infinite and eternal grace,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   who hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Amen.
