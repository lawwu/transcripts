[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   Throughout the arc of Radical Personal Finance, I've sought to emphasize for you some themes
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:13.280]   that I believe are very, very important and are often underrepresented in the world of
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.820]   financial advice.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.400]   One of those themes that I've encouraged you to continually focus on is to put money in
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.080]   its rightful place.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.360]   Money is important, but it's not of utmost importance.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.200]   It's not of the highest importance.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.000]   In fact, if you were to sit down and to write down a list of the things in your life that
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.660]   are important, if you were to be honest about it, I think you'd have to put money pretty
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.800]   far down the list.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   Now the trick with money, of course, is that it influences all those other things.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.740]   So in many ways, it doesn't even belong on the list because money is the fuel.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.260]   It's the energy that allows so many other important things to be accomplished.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.160]   It's engaged in part of every other aspect of life.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200]   But money is not of utmost importance.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   I was reminded of this over the weekend.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.960]   I was reading my friend J.D. Roth's website, getrichslowly.org, really well-done website.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.400]   J.D. Roth, he's been on the show, a personal friend of mine.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.120]   He's one of the people in the world of personal finance that I most enjoy spending time with.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.080]   He started Get Rich Slowly back in 2006 in the early days of the online financial blogosphere,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.840]   built the site up to be one of the leading personal finance sites, sold it.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.240]   That capitalized him to a place of being financially independent.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240]   He retired.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.960]   You all know how much I love that word.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.720]   He retired for a number of years.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.120]   Recently, he bought the site back from the people that he sold it to and he's taken back
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.640]   over control of it and he's been steadily writing again.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.960]   He wrote an article over the weekend called On the Importance of Putting First Things
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   First.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   It's very well done.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.560]   J.D. has a philosophical bent.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.340]   He's well-studied in philosophy and he does a good job on discussions like this to really
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.400]   articulate the things that matter.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.040]   I want to read you one tiny excerpt from his essay.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520]   Again, this is entitled On the Importance of Putting First Things First.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   He writes this, "Here's a classic example.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.240]   Yesterday in the Financial Independence Forum on Reddit, an anonymous user posted a heartbreaking
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.600]   story about losing the love of his life because he was too focused on money, too obsessed
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.160]   with how and what, and not enough on why.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.080]   Here's his story."
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.720]   Now we're reading the quoted post from the Reddit user.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   "I should be clear, it's because I obsessed over FI, financial independence, FI, and ignored
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.900]   my life goals.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.440]   Together for seven years, living together for most of it, she was perfect for me and
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.200]   was also very frugal.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.840]   I had it all.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.160]   I read the sticky post, 'Find the life you want to live and save for it,' or whatever
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.200]   it's called, but I didn't take it to heart.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.600]   I thought I was doing this.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   I didn't understand.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.640]   I was so wrong.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.560]   I was blind.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.720]   I was living the life I wanted to, but I was ignoring the life that my partner wanted.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.960]   I didn't spend money with her to do the things she really valued.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.360]   I didn't buy plane tickets to go visit her family with her when she desperately wanted
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   me to come.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.400]   My whole life I said I wanted kids and then discovered FI and changed my mind because
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.640]   they were too expensive.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.400]   I refused to buy nicer furniture for our apartment and made her embarrassed about our place and
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   not comfortable in her own home.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.940]   Over and over I made this mistake and we drifted apart.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.920]   She wasn't asking for much, just for things she really valued.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   She is frugal.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.480]   I was selfish and I lost sight of the fact I always wanted kids.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.600]   I realize this all now, but it's too late.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.040]   I told her all of this, but it's too late.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.840]   Don't be me.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.640]   Examine every facet of your life and think about it.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.960]   I regret it all.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.620]   FI ruined my life, but it's my fault, not FI's fault.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.000]   It was my obsession.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.060]   So here's my advice.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.320]   Focus on the life you want to live, but compromise with your partner too because I'd trade all
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.280]   the money in my bank for that relationship back.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.040]   And once you're in the boring middle, focus on what makes you and your family happy today.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.760]   Don't be me.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.920]   Don't get obsessed.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.720]   Live in the present."
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.280]   End of quote.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.660]   I hope you hear the pain in that post and I hope you take that pain to heart because
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:12.080]   wisdom ensures that you'll listen to other people's pain and avoid the causes of that
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.400]   pain.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.200]   It's a fool who says, "I need to experience everything myself.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.440]   I have to see everything myself.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.240]   I have to know everything myself."
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.040]   And it's a wise man who says, "I'm going to learn from the example of others."
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.880]   Don't be a fool.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.800]   When somebody who is obsessed and committed to financial independence writes these words,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.920]   focus on the life you want to live, but compromise with your partner too because I'd trade all
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.760]   the money in my bank for that relationship back.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.280]   You should pay attention.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.360]   Now let's say that your marriage or your, I don't know what to call these relationships,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.640]   your romantic liaison is rock solid.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.320]   You and your romantic partner share common goals, common values, a common approach.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Everything is great.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.240]   My friend, that's not the only relationship in your life that matters.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.480]   Now this is a big deal for me personally because I have this obsessive personality.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.280]   It's very easy for me to become obsessed with things.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.640]   When I grab onto something, I go into it as fast as possible.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.520]   And that in some ways can be a blessing.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   It gives me the ability to do radical personal finance.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.840]   I get interested in a subject and I go and read dozens of books on it.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.560]   I try and search out every idea that I can.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.640]   I chart them all out.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.040]   I organize this little mental map that I live by and I try to go all the way to the
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.400]   extreme end of it.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.760]   That's good, right?
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.560]   But it's also very bad because I share this obsessive personality where if I focused on
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.280]   Phi, I would do what this man did.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.680]   I think that's part of why I have such a burden to help you and to help myself continue to
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.400]   avoid it.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.040]   Money is easy to become obsessed about because it's so easily measured.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.320]   And since, as we learned from Drucker, what gets measured gets managed, money can be managed
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.640]   very well.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.080]   And because it's so easily measured and so easily managed, it's easy to obsess over the
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.520]   numbers.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:51.200]   There are very few other things in life that are so intensely numerical.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.640]   It's very hard to put the quality of your relationship with your wife or your husband
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.360]   into a spreadsheet.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:06.520]   It's very hard for you to put your relationship with your children into a spreadsheet.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.400]   You can find some metrics that are helpful.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.160]   In the past, I tracked the number of hugs that I gave my wife per day because I realized
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   I'm not hugging her enough.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.480]   In fact, today, I'm going to say the words, I realized I'm not hugging her enough.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.160]   I need to add more hugs to my daily schedule.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.440]   I have to track something to build it.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.640]   But the number of hugs that I give my wife on a daily basis doesn't actually predict
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.320]   the quality of my relationship.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:44.240]   They contribute, but it's not a perfectly predictive factor.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.680]   There are some things that are even more easily measured than the quality of relationships,
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.240]   something like your weight or your blood pressure.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:57.500]   But we all know that those are not de facto guarantees of good health.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.200]   Good health goes far beyond the numbers on a scale.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.360]   But money is so numerical and it's easy to be obsessed over and it's easy to lose perspective.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.880]   I beg you, do not lose perspective.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:21.280]   Recognize the value of money in your life, but do not lose the perspective.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.640]   I want to emphasize this on two levels.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.080]   One is the level that this anonymous writer on Reddit wrote about.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:36.560]   The money in your relationships here, now, in your life.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.640]   Recognize what you may miss out on.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.920]   Would you really trade an extra few hundred dollars or extra few thousand dollars in your
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.880]   bank account for a chance to sit down with your grandparents and hear their stories again
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.440]   face to face?
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:02.320]   They will be dead and gone before you know it.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.000]   How's your relationship with your mom and dad?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.600]   Have you taken the time to embrace them and to engage with them and to listen to them
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.340]   and to let your relationship grow?
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:23.200]   Some people's relationships with their parents start off good, go bad, and never change.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.120]   Some people's relationships with their parents start good and get better throughout their
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.880]   lifetime.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.720]   Some people's relationships start good, get bad, and then get better for the rest of their
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.320]   life.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:40.800]   But it's worth spending money and time and effort and energy on those relationships.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.680]   Go down the list.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.960]   Think about your friends.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.680]   Think about your family.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.400]   Think about those you love.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:00.120]   And don't prioritize your money over the people.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.320]   That's the first level.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.480]   I couldn't help though, of course, I think about the second level, which is to think
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.760]   from an eternal perspective.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.320]   And I immediately thought of the account that's recorded from Jesus of the account of the
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.480]   rich man in heaven and the poor man, sorry, the rich man in hell and the poor man Lazarus.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.040]   And I pulled out and found it in my Bible and I read it.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   And it just, to me, is so utterly important to put this into perspective.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.240]   I want to read you this story.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.560]   If you're not a regular Bible reader, this particular one, this particular story for
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.280]   context comes from the book of Luke.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.880]   Book of Luke is really the only history book in the Bible from a strict sense.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.080]   Luke was not a man who, he wasn't one of Jesus' disciples.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.160]   He never met Jesus.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.360]   He never knew Jesus personally.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.840]   He was a physician who, after Jesus died and rose again and the church was founded, he
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.320]   was a physician from, and he wasn't even a Jew.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.560]   He wasn't most of Jesus, all of Jesus' disciples were Jews in the early years, but Luke himself
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.440]   wasn't a Jew.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.800]   He was a Syrian.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.720]   And he, through a series of circumstances that I won't take the time to talk about here,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   he went and he started to build this history of the life of Jesus.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.000]   And so Luke is the one who includes all of these interesting details and these things
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.080]   that aren't present in the other three gospels.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:34.520]   The other three gospels were written by eyewitnesses to the life of Jesus, but Luke is different.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.200]   Luke was a journalist.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.000]   He was the one who went and interviewed all of the people who were around the life of
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Jesus.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.560]   For example, the only place that we get the details of Jesus' birth in detail come from
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.960]   the book of Luke.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.240]   And historians would generally agree that that's because Luke would have taken the time
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.000]   to go and interview Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.200]   And she was the one who knew these details, who knew the things that had happened, who
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:06.160]   knew the details of the conception of Jesus, who knew the details of the cousin of Jesus,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.400]   John the Baptist, and Elizabeth, and all of these circumstances of their early years.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   And so those all come from Luke.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.560]   And Luke did it very, very carefully.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   He was a very precise man.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.040]   When you're reading Luke, you get much more precise language than you read in others of
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   the gospels.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.760]   For example, Luke, especially with medical terms.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.480]   Luke was a doctor, and so it's interesting you hear constantly this medical terminology
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.920]   when Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.120]   The other gospel that that account is recorded in says that she had a fever.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.560]   Luke says that she had a high fever, which is a medical terminology.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.880]   Luke was the one who was really amazing when I studied the history of it.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.520]   Luke was one who was very, very detailed in recording many of the healing miracles that
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   Jesus did.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   He was very precise with the medical details.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.480]   And so he records in his gospel, he records this account of Jesus preaching about the
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.920]   rich man and Lazarus.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:13.480]   And this is Jesus who, remember, this is Jesus, the one who has the inside knowledge of what
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.240]   actually happens in the spirit world.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.280]   There are many in this world who are very perceptive spiritually.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.040]   I'm always amazed to see this perceptiveness come out.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.120]   And there are many who have an ability to see at a deeper level.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.760]   Just last week, a friend of mine had an encounter with a witch on the street who was just amazing,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.440]   this woman's spiritual perception just as their family was walking by.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.280]   But this is Jesus who's preaching and he's preaching about the rich man and Lazarus.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.040]   I guess, forgive me, I forget that this is Radical Personal Finance and that I'm not
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.840]   preaching and so I go into too many details.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.640]   But let me just read to you the account here.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   This is Jesus speaking.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.260]   He says this, "There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.760]   sumptuously every day.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.640]   And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.280]   be fed with what fell from the rich man's table.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.640]   Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.060]   The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.500]   The rich man also died and was buried.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.380]   And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.840]   at his side.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.180]   And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the end of his
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.780]   finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.'
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:50.600]   But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.860]   and Lazarus and like men are bad things.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.680]   But now he is comforted here and you are in anguish.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.940]   And besides all this, between us and you, a great chasm has been fixed, in order that
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.460]   those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.400]   to us.'
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.000]   And he said, 'Then I beg you, Father, to send him to my father's house, for I have five
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.740]   brothers so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.'
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:26.060]   But Abraham said," one of the most chilling passages in scripture that I know of, "Abraham
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.840]   said, 'They have Moses and the prophets.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.480]   Let them hear them.'
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.480]   Then he said, 'No, Father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.800]   repent.'
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:46.620]   He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.120]   if someone should rise from the dead.'"
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:57.760]   Now I'll forego here in this context, preaching on that scripture passage for the next hour.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:04.200]   And I'll just simply emphasize this.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:19.120]   Your money may buy you some certain pleasures, but those pleasures may be only for a season.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.400]   There are things that go far beyond what your money can buy for you.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.520]   We all believe it.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   You believe that.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.120]   I believe that.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.360]   But we don't all manage our money in accordance with that belief.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.280]   I recommend it to you.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.600]   As we go, I want to play for you a song.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.840]   It's two short songs put together.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:56.800]   And I want to encourage you to think very carefully about the words of the song, because
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.600]   I was just struck at how valuable this is.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:07.520]   And of course, the verse that is of most note is towards the end where it says, "Like a
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:16.120]   king I may live in a palace so tall, with great riches to call my own.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.720]   But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone."
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:28.360]   Friend, keep your money in its proper place.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:37.200]   It's very important, but it's not of utmost importance.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.560]   Live according to that truth.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:50.320]   Don't live according to the idea that your money is most important.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:57.880]   There's a great danger, and it's one that we all have to constantly, constantly be reminded
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   to avoid.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   Just one voice singing in the darkness.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   All it takes is one voice singing so they hear what's on your mind.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:26.880]   And when you look around, you'll find there's more than one voice singing in the darkness.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:35.520]   Singing in the darkness.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.120]   Joining with your one voice.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:47.400]   Each and every note, another octave, hence our joy and fears unlocked.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:20:00.120]   If only one voice would start out on its own, we need just one voice facing the unknown.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.680]   And then that one voice would never be alone.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:24.240]   It takes that one voice, just one voice singing in the darkness.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:37.120]   All it takes is one voice, shout it out and let it ring.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.680]   Just one voice.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:21:03.760]   It takes that one voice and everyone will see.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:28.560]   Once I stood in the light with my head bowed low.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:56.400]   I looked in the darkness as black as could be.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   Hold my hand all the way.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   Every hour, every day.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   From here to the great unknown.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   Take my hand, let me stand where no one stands alone.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   Like a king, I may live in a palace so tall.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   But you know a thing in this whole wide world, that's worse than being alone.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   Hold my hand all the way.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   Every hour, every day.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   From here to the great unknown.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:24:01.400]   Take my hand, let me stand where no one stands alone.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   Take my hand, let me stand where no one stands alone.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   [Applause]
