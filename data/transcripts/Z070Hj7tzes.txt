[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:16.200]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.800]   John answered them, saying, I baptize with water; but there standeth one among you whom
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.920]   ye know not, and I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.960]   unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.200]   is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.160]   Now most of you will realize that I take these two verses and put them together because of
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.960]   this great truth which they bring out, namely that John the Baptist was constantly telling
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.400]   the people that he was not the Christ, and that the essential difference between them
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.520]   was that he, John, baptized with water, whereas the Christ would baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.000]   Now why are we looking at this?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.200]   Well, we are doing so because, as we have been seeing at great length, the truth about
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.400]   the Christian should be this, the statement in the sixteenth verse of this first chapter
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.760]   of John's Gospel, "And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for or upon
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.360]   grace."
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.840]   That is what the Christian is meant to be like.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   He is a man who has received something of the fullness of Christ, and he goes on receiving
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.080]   it increasingly.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.960]   That is the Christian life.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.560]   That is what it means to be a Christian.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.840]   And I am suggesting that immediately John the Evangelist shows us the way in which this
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.120]   can become true of us, and increasingly true of us, and that is that we receive of his
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:15.600]   fullness in large and great measure when we are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost by
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.480]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.680]   Now then, in order to bring this out, we have been showing something of this contrast that
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.520]   John the Baptist himself drew so clearly in his ministry.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.580]   We dealt with the best exposition of that, as it is to be found in the third chapter
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.840]   of the Gospel according to St. Luke in the first seventeen verses.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.600]   And there we saw some of the striking contrasts between John's baptism and our Lord's
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.480]   baptism, putting it very roughly, the difference between religion and Christianity.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.440]   Or indeed, we can go further, the difference between being content with the beginnings,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   or what the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews calls the first principles only, of the doctrine
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.720]   of Christ and this same doctrine in greater fullness.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.800]   Now we are doing this, and I must go on repeating this, because this is no academic exercise.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.360]   I am not doing this because of all the interest that is being manifested on all hands at the
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.960]   present time in this question of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the occasional gifts
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.080]   that may accompany it.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.880]   But I am doing something that we have been doing for over two years.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   We have spent two years in considering the prologue of John's Gospel because, as I
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.960]   have been trying to show, it seems to me that this is the thing we need above everything
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.000]   else at this present time.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.840]   We need it as individual Christians, but we need it still more because of the state of
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.120]   the world that is round and about us.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.400]   If we have no sense of responsibility for the condition of humanity at this moment,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.480]   well then there is only one thing to say.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.200]   If we are Christians at all, we are very poor Christians.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.520]   If we are only concerned about ourselves and our own happiness, and if the moral condition
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.840]   of society and the tragedy of the whole world does not grieve us, if we are not disturbed
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.880]   at the way in which men blaspheme the name of God and/or the arrogance of sin, well,
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.760]   what can be said about us?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.320]   But I am assuming that we are concerned.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.880]   That we are concerned ourselves that we may receive what God has intended us to receive
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   in his Son.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.440]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, and if we are not receiving
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.560]   what he has made possible, well, it is an insult to God.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.640]   So these two aspects must be borne in mind—our own individual states and needs, but still
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.200]   more I say the condition of the world as it is around and about us.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.900]   Now then, that is what we are doing, and I am trying to show that the great danger constantly
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:18.400]   is that we should be content with something which is altogether less intended for us.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.720]   Now let me put it like this.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.560]   Perhaps the greatest danger of all for Christian people always is to interpret the scriptures
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.080]   in the light of our own experiences instead of doing it the other way around.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.040]   We should not interpret scripture in the light of our experiences, but we should examine
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.160]   our experiences in the light of the teaching of the scripture.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.720]   Now this is a fundamental and basic point.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.760]   It is particularly important, I feel, just at this moment in view of the things that
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.560]   are happening in the Christian church and the talk that is around and about us.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.440]   Now there are two main ways in which it seems to me we can go wrong in this question of
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.240]   the relationship of our experiences to the teaching of the scripture.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:19.840]   The first danger is the danger of claiming things which either go beyond the scripture
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.280]   or which indeed may even be contrary to the scripture.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.000]   There are many who have done that throughout the centuries, and there are people who are
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   still doing it.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.680]   There have been people—you had them in the early church—they were claiming that they
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.040]   were uniquely inspired.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.240]   The apostle calls them false apostles.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.240]   There were people who claimed that they were receiving revelation, and they did not care
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.000]   what the teaching was.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.760]   They said they had got this directly from God.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.560]   Now as I say, throughout the centuries there have been people who, claiming to be ultra-spiritual,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.720]   have gone beyond the scriptures.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.760]   I remember once hearing a man saying he did not care what the apostle Paul or anybody
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   else said.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   He knew.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   He had had an experience.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.240]   He had put him in such and such.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   He is putting his own experience above the scriptures.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.280]   That opens the door to fanaticism—not enthusiasm, but fanaticism and other horrible possible
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   dangers.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:34.560]   So there is one danger, that we put what we experience subjectively over the scripture
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.240]   and put it superior to the scripture.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.280]   Another way in which this is done, of course, is to put tradition or the teaching of the
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.520]   church above scripture.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.040]   That is the Roman Catholic heresy to say that tradition is coordinate with the scripture.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.840]   That means in the end that tradition is superior to the scripture.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.240]   You see, there is nothing in the scripture about the so-called assumption of the Virgin
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.080]   Mary that she never died and was buried, but literally rose in the body into heaven.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.480]   There is not a word about it in the scripture, but they teach it.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.400]   It is their authority to learn, to sanction such a teaching.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.760]   Not a word to suggest that anywhere in the scripture.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.560]   That is the kind of thing I mean.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:26.520]   But forgetting something as obvious as the Roman Catholic heresy, there are many, I say,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.840]   who are always prone, and they are generally the most spiritually minded people, to become
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.640]   so interested in the experimental side that they become indifferent to the scripture.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.280]   Now, the Quakers, the early Quakers, were particularly subject to this, with their emphasis
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.880]   on the inner light.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.040]   They again did say that whatever the scripture may say, they knew.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.060]   It had been revealed to them directly.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.320]   One of the poor men claimed that he was the incarnate Christ again, and rode into the
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.440]   city of Bristol on a horse, with many misguided people following him, believing his teaching,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.760]   because he spoke it with authority.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:11.040]   Now, that is fanaticism, and it is a terrible, a horrible danger, which we must always bear
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   in mind.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   But that is how it arises.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.760]   It is this divorce between the scripture and experience, and it is putting experience above
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.000]   the scripture in the sense that we claim things that are not sanctioned by the scripture,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.600]   perhaps even prohibited by the scripture.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.160]   But there is a second danger, and it is equally important that we should bear it in mind,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.560]   because the second is the exact opposite of the first.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.160]   And these things, as I am never tired of reminding you, generally go from one violent extreme
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160]   to the other.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   How difficult it is to maintain a balance, always.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.120]   The second danger, then, is this.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.360]   Is the danger of being satisfied with something very much less than that which is offered
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:10.040]   in the scripture, and the danger of interpreting scripture by our experiences and reducing
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.760]   the teaching of the scripture to the level of what we know and experience.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.880]   And I would say that the second is the greater danger of the two at the present time.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.000]   In other words, certain people by nature are afraid of the supernatural, they are afraid
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.320]   of the unusual, they are afraid of disorder.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.840]   And you know, you can be so afraid of disorder, you can be so concerned about discipline and
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.560]   decorum and control, that you become guilty of what the scriptures call quenching the
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   spirit.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.200]   And there is no question in my mind that there has been a great deal of this.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.760]   People come to the New Testament, instead of taking the New Testament teaching as it
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.720]   is, they interpret the New Testament in the light of their experiences.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.320]   And so they reduce it.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.700]   They minimize the great statements of the New Testament.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:15.440]   Everything is interpreted in terms of what they have and what they experience.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.400]   And I believe that this is very largely responsible for the condition of the Christian Church
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.320]   at this present time.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.200]   People are so afraid of what they call enthusiasm, and some are so afraid of fanaticism.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.760]   People are so afraid of excesses, that in order to avoid those, they go right over to
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.920]   the other side, and they don't face what is offered in the New Testament.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.960]   But they say the norm, the standard, is what they are and what they have.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.240]   Now, to put to you clearly what I am trying to say, let me put it like this.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.180]   I hope to go into this in greater detail on subsequent Sunday mornings.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.200]   But let me put it just in a nutshell in this way.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   Compare, for instance, what you read about the life of the Church at Corinth with the
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   typical Church life today.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.120]   "Ah, but you say they were guilty of excesses in Corinth."
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.800]   I quite agree.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:19.680]   But how many churches do you know at the present time to which it is necessary to write such
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.640]   a letter as the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   Don't put your emphasis entirely on the excesses.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.760]   Paul corrects the excesses, but look what he allows.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.200]   Look what he expects.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.800]   Take your New Testament as it is.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.280]   Look at the New Testament Christian, look at the New Testament Church, and you will
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.480]   see it that vibrant with a spiritual life.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.840]   And of course, it is life always that tends to lead to excesses.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.000]   There is no problem of discipline in a graveyard.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.280]   There is no problem very much in a formal church.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.680]   The problems arise when there is life.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:11.960]   A poor sickly child is not difficult to handle, but when that child is well and full of life
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.560]   and of vigor, well, then you have your problems.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.880]   Problems are created by life and by vigor.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.720]   The problems of the early church were spiritual problems, problems arising because of the
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.920]   danger to go to excess in the spiritual realm.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.000]   Would anybody like to claim that that is the danger in the church speaking generally today?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.400]   Well, it isn't, of course, and the reason for that is that we have been tending to interpret
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.040]   the New Testament teaching in the light of our own experiences.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:48.480]   We assume that we have got everything, and therefore the whole of this teaching is reduced
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.720]   to the level of what we have and what we are.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.960]   Now, then, there are the two great dangers, and as I am trying to indicate, they are both
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.480]   wrong, and they are both equally wrong.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.000]   The excesses, of course, and the fanaticism are more spectacular, and they always attract
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.120]   attention.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.040]   But the other is equally bad, if not more so.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.320]   You see, there is all the difference in the world between a man in a state of delirium
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.360]   when he is ill, and a man suffering from some terrible growth which is just eating out the
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:28.680]   vitals of his life and of his body, and reducing him to a state of, more or less, of paralysis
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.920]   and of helplessness.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:37.040]   But you see, the two things are equally bad, and therefore we have to remember these two
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   things.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:45.580]   And so I would lay down this fundamental proposition as we handle this whole matter, that everything
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.920]   must be tested by the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.680]   We must not start with what we think, with what we like.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.380]   Some of us would like the spectacular, others are so dignified that dignity is the one thing
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.480]   that matters.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.160]   Everything must be ordered and dignified and orderly, working like a clock, with all the
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.480]   mechanism and mechanistic characteristics of a clock or of a machine.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.840]   So if we start with ourselves and what we like and our experience, we will already go
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   wrong.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.440]   No, no, we have got to start, all of us, with the New Testament and its teaching.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.080]   Well, fortunately for us, there is plenty of it.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.640]   We have already been looking at the teaching of John the Baptist, and we have also looked
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.280]   at those two most interesting incidents which are recorded in the Book of the Acts of the
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.620]   Apostles at the end of chapter 18 and the beginning of chapter 19, the case of Apollos
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.320]   and the case of those disciples whom the Apostle Paul found at Ephesus.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:54.680]   And what we have discovered hitherto is this, that there are obviously grades, steps, stages
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.360]   in the Christian life.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.240]   The New Testament is full of that—babes in Christ, young men, old men, growing in
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.180]   grace and in the knowledge of the Lord, and so on.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:13.280]   But not only that, we have found that this is more than supported and fulfilled and substantiated
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.800]   in the subsequent history of men in the long story of the Christian Church.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   And we see, especially in those two instances there that I have referred to, that what really
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:34.400]   makes the difference is this baptism of the Holy Spirit, or with the Holy Spirit, or this
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.760]   receiving of the Spirit.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.760]   Now, let me try to put this teaching of the New Testament as I understand it in the form
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.800]   of a number of principles.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.040]   We have got to do this because John tells us there at the beginning of his Gospel that
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.440]   the thing that is going to differentiate the new era from the old, even including John
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.680]   the Baptist, is this baptism with the Spirit.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.040]   Very well, what are the principles?
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.920]   Well, here is the first.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.640]   It is possible for us to be believers in the Lord Jesus Christ without having received
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.600]   the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.280]   Now, then, there is my proposition.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.640]   But let me clarify this, because it is often misunderstood.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.840]   And this is, to me, the crux of the whole interpretation of the New Testament at this
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   point.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.920]   This is the key point, it seems to me.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.800]   Don't you start thinking about phenomena.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.440]   I may come to that in three or four Sundays, I don't know.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.880]   But don't start with that.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.520]   That is the fatal mistake that people make.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.680]   They start with phenomena, and they have got their prejudices, and they tether up their
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.120]   lines and points, and the New Testament teaching is entirely forgotten.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.880]   No, no.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   Start with the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.840]   Need of clarification, I say, well, how?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.880]   Well, like this.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.080]   It is obvious that no man can be a Christian at all apart from the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   That is obvious.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.880]   The natural man, the natural mind, we are told, is enmity against God, is not subject
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.720]   to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.160]   The apostle Paul, whom I have just quoted in Romans 8, 7, in that whole passage draws
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.040]   his great distinction between the natural man and the spiritual man.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.200]   And that is the great difference.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:36.120]   The spiritual man is a man, he says, who is led by the Spirit and walks after the Spirit,
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.120]   not after the flesh.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.120]   Very well.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.360]   You see, therefore, basically, you have got to start by saying, no man can be a Christian
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.880]   at all without the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:51.040]   The natural mind, enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   can be.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.120]   And again, in 1 Corinthians 2, 14, he puts it again in this way.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:03.560]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:10.040]   unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually deserved.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.560]   Again, in that chapter, the apostle is drawing a distinction between the Christian and the
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   non-Christian.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.640]   He says, even the princes of this world, though they are great men, in great positions, and
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.080]   men of great ability, they are not Christians.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   Why?
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.120]   Well, they have not believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.560]   Had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   But how do we believe?
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.720]   How does anybody believe in him?
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:42.120]   Well, he says, God hath revealed these things unto us by his Spirit.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.280]   The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.040]   And again he says, we have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.520]   that is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:04.320]   He says, we are Christians because the Holy Spirit has worked in us and has given us this
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.760]   enlightenment and knowledge and understanding, this ability to believe.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.000]   A man cannot believe without the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.320]   In every believer, the Holy Spirit is of necessity a resident.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.200]   That is a fundamental statement of the whole of the Scripture.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.440]   It is the Spirit who convicts us and who gives us the enlightenment and the ability to believe.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.880]   No man by nature can believe the gospel.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.640]   This is fundamental right through the whole Bible.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.720]   But then we can go further.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.560]   It is the Holy Spirit who regenerates us.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   It is he who gives us new life.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.000]   The Christian is a man who is born again, yes, he is a man who is born of the Spirit.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.720]   Now, in the gospel of John, as we shall find, there is great teaching about this, you get
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.680]   it at once, in our Lord's teaching to Nicodemus of all men, except a man be born of water
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.480]   and of the Spirit.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   He cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.160]   That is it.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:15.440]   This is something that happens as a result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.680]   Regeneration is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.600]   It is a secret work of the Spirit.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.400]   It is not something experimental.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.120]   That is a secret work, and a man only knows that it has happened to him.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.480]   But we have a very specific statement in the ninth verse of the eighth chapter of Paul's
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:39.160]   epistle to the Romans, which puts this matter quite tersely once and forever.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.440]   He says, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.000]   God dwell in you."
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.040]   Now, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   So that clearly, any man who is a Christian is a man in whom the Holy Spirit of God dwells.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.480]   I take it that that is therefore abundantly clear to all of us.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.640]   You cannot be a Christian without having the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:21.600]   But, and here is the point, I am asserting at the same time that you can be a believer,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:30.720]   that you can have the Holy Spirit dwelling in you, and still you have not been baptized
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.600]   with the Holy Ghost.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.000]   Now, this is the crucial issue.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Why do I say this?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.680]   Well, let me give you my reasons.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:48.280]   All I have been describing is the work of the Holy Spirit in us—the work of convicting,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:54.120]   the work of enlightening, the work of regenerating, and so on.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   That is what the Holy Spirit does in us.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.360]   But, as you notice in this teaching which we have there at the beginning in the first
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:08.240]   chapter of John's Gospel, and which we saw so clearly in the preaching of John the Baptist,
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.440]   the baptism of the Holy Ghost is something that is done by the Lord Jesus Christ, not
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:23.880]   I indeed baptize you with water; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.760]   This is not primarily some work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.940]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ's act.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:36.440]   It is his action, what he does to us through the Spirit, or his giving to us in this particular
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.200]   way of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.360]   Now, here it seems to me as something that is there, plain and clear, on the very surface
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.560]   of this whole matter.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.400]   And yet people get confused over this.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.000]   They quote 1 Corinthians 12, 13, "We have all been baptized by one Spirit."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.520]   Of course we have.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.900]   Our being baptized into the body of Christ is the work of the Spirit, as regeneration
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.160]   is his work.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.440]   But this is something entirely different.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.520]   This is Christ baptizing us with the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:18.380]   And I am suggesting that this is something which is therefore obviously distinct from
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:26.360]   and separate from becoming a Christian, being regenerate, having the Holy Spirit dwelling
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.600]   within you.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.120]   I am putting it like this, that you can be a child of God and yet not baptized with the
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   Holy Spirit.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.800]   Now then, let me give you some proof.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.180]   I start with the Old Testament saints.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:48.320]   The Old Testament saints were as much the children of God as you and I are.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.800]   Abraham is the father of the faithful.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.200]   Abraham was a child of God.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.360]   Now, I could give you endless scriptures to prove that.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.920]   Our Lord himself says that you shall sit in the kingdom of God with Abraham, Isaac, and
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   Jacob.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.400]   And yet some of these Jews are going to be outside, though they kept on boasting that
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.720]   Abraham was their father.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.320]   But that is what it means to be in the kingdom of God, to be with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.320]   Paul in the third chapter of Galatians at great length shows that all the children of
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.280]   faith are children of Abraham.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.640]   He is the father of the faithful.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.500]   Indeed, the apostle Paul, as the apostle to the Gentiles, goes out of his way to emphasize
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:38.840]   this great thing, that when the Gentiles became Christians, what happened to them was that
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.240]   they became fellow citizens with the saints.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.000]   That is to say, the saints of the Old Testament, and joint heirs with the saints of the Old
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Testament.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.360]   You remember that great contrast in the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.120]   He puts it like this in verses 11 and so on, "Wherefore remember that ye, being in time
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.320]   past, Gentiles in the flesh, which are called uncircumcision by that which is called the
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.720]   circumcision in the flesh made by hells, that at that time you were without Christ, you
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.960]   were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise."
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.440]   That is where they were.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.440]   But now, in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   Christ.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.560]   "Therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.280]   and of the household of God."
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.600]   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, all these men of the Old Testament, they all belonged
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.280]   to the household of God.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.080]   And when we become Christians as Gentiles, we become fellow citizens with them, and members
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   of the household of God.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.360]   And then, to make this thing abundantly clear, the apostle repeats it in the third chapter
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.720]   of Ephesians.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.040]   He says that the revelation had been made known to him of the mystery.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   What is it?
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   Well, here it is.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.920]   "Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed by
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:08.240]   his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.560]   and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ."
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.480]   Very well.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.160]   If you think that the Old Testament saints were not children of God, you are denying
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.720]   the whole of the Scripture.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:28.160]   They were, but they had not been baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:35.400]   They were children of God, but they were not baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.680]   "Abraham believed in Christ," the Lord says.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:45.480]   "Abraham saw my day, he saw it afar off, and he rejoiced."
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.400]   These men did not understand it fully, but what made them children of God and men of
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.600]   faith was this, that they believed God's testimony about this coming one.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.520]   No man can be saved except in Christ.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.920]   There is only one way of salvation, Old Testament and new.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.800]   It is always in Christ and by him crucified.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.700]   Very well, there are your Old Testament saints, but come along.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.760]   What about John the Baptist himself?
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.640]   Our Lord makes this quite clear.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:21.320]   He says that no greater than John has ever arisen amongst the sons of women.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:27.000]   "Say unto you, There hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist," he says.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.400]   "Amongst the sons of women, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.680]   greater than John the Baptist."
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:40.560]   Now then, and yet John was not baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.880]   John the Baptist is a son of God, he is a child of God.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.680]   "Nevertheless," says our Lord, "he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   than he."
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.600]   That is a reference to the kingdom of heaven taking the form of the Church.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.280]   That though John the Baptist is the last of the prophets, though he is a child of God
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:06.080]   and a unique servant of God, though the man is as saved as any Christian, he is not enjoying
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.560]   the benefits which those who have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which Christ
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.000]   is to give, are able to enjoy.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.440]   So John the Baptist is a believer, he is a child of God, but he was not baptized with
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   the Holy Ghost.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.640]   And then you remember that most important statement in the seventh chapter of John's
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640]   Gospel.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.880]   Let me read it to you in verses 37 to 39.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.280]   "Now in the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and cried, saying,
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.600]   'If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:48.960]   He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.400]   of living water.'
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.040]   But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.160]   For the Holy Ghost was not yet"—the authorised version adds "given" quite rightly—"was
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.960]   not yet given, was not yet, had not come in that way yet.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.160]   The Holy Spirit always was, of course.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.800]   You read about him in the Old Testament.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.600]   He wasn't given in this way yet.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.320]   He was given like that on the day of Pentecost, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:25.600]   Now there again is one of these crucial statements.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.120]   But let's go on and add to that.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.480]   All this, it seems to me, becomes much clearer when you come right on to the book of the
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   Acts of the Apostles and look at the case of the apostles themselves.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:48.800]   Now surely it is quite obvious that the apostles were regenerate and were children of God before
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.920]   the day of Pentecost.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.880]   Our Lord has already said, "Now are ye clean through the word which I have spoken
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.480]   unto you."
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.880]   In the great high priestly prayer in the seventeenth chapter of John, he keeps on drawing a distinction
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.840]   between them and the world.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:15.240]   "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.560]   Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.640]   I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.560]   they are thine."
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.840]   And throughout the whole of that seventeenth chapter in the record of the high priestly
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.720]   prayer, the whole emphasis is that these people are already regenerate.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.600]   Our Lord keeps on saying that.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.760]   He says, "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.160]   them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.000]   didst send me."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.120]   Nothing could be clearer.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.080]   These men are believers, these men are Christians.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.960]   And then you remember we are told that after the resurrection, our Lord met with them in
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.440]   an upper room, and he breathed upon them.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.280]   He breathed upon them the Holy Ghost.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.520]   You remember that incident, it's recorded there in the twentieth chapter of John's
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   Gospel.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.920]   "Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.560]   As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.960]   And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.680]   Holy Ghost."
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.600]   These men are not only believers, they are regenerate men.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.360]   The Holy Spirit has been breathed upon them, and they have received him in that way.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.440]   They still have not been baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:57.680]   John Acts 1, verses, well let me take you back to get this thing perfectly clear, verse
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   4.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.400]   "And being assembled together with them, he commended them that they should not depart
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.080]   from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which saith he, Ye have heard
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   of me.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.800]   And when John truly baptized with water, here it is again, but ye shall be baptized
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.640]   with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.240]   When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.760]   time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.040]   And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:39.000]   hath put in his own power; but ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   you.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.600]   And ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.400]   and unto the uttermost parts of the earth."
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:58.360]   And as you remember, these selfsame men, already believers and regenerate, already having received
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:04.760]   the Holy Spirit in one sense, were baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:11.080]   This is my way of substantiating that a man can be a true believer in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.920]   and a child of God, and still not be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:24.040]   But come, let us go on to the evidence which we have already seen this morning.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.440]   In the eighth chapter of the book of Acts of the Apostles, where it is perhaps still
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:38.240]   more clearly put before us, Philip, you remember, went down from Jerusalem to Samaria to preach
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.200]   the gospel to those Samaritans.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:48.240]   And we are told this, "The people, with one accord, gave heed unto those things which
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.160]   Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.360]   And there was great joy in that city."
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.780]   Then you have got this incident about this man, Simon.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.080]   But concentrate on these others.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:12.400]   But when they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.840]   name of Jesus Christ—now this is not the teaching of John the Baptist, this is the
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.360]   teaching of Philip, filled with the Holy Spirit, baptized with the Holy Spirit after the day
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   of Pentecost.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.800]   The plain Christian teaching, they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.360]   kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   They were baptized, both men and women.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.360]   Now then, here they are, you see, they are believers, and they are rejoicing in their
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   belief.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.800]   They have been baptized, not with John's baptism, but they have been baptized in the
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.160]   name of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.960]   But then, verse 14, "Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.120]   had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John, who when they were come
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:06.120]   down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost."
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:12.840]   Then in brackets, "For as yet he was fallen upon none of them, only they were baptized
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.720]   in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:25.200]   Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:32.920]   These people were already true believers on the Lord Jesus Christ, and him crucified as
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.600]   their Savior.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.020]   They had been baptized into his name because they had become believers, but still they
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.960]   are not baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.400]   I am just suggesting that you can be a true believer, a true Christian, born again, a
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:55.560]   child of God, and still may not have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.360]   The next case is none other than the case of the Apostle Paul himself.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   Now, I am spending this morning by just taking you through the scriptures.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.280]   We shall be drawing lessons and working out this in detail, God willing, on subsequent
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   Sunday mornings.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.360]   But it is so vital that we should start with the scriptures, my friends, not with our prejudices,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.600]   not with what we think, not with what we are afraid of.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.160]   "Ah," they say, "now you are opening the door wide to tongues."
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   I am sure many are already thinking that.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.920]   You wait a minute.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.240]   I shall deal with the question of gifts when it comes at the right place.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   You do not start with that.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.640]   That comes towards the end of this treatment.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:39.360]   But that is how the devil gets us to bypass the scriptures, in the interests of our particular
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.920]   point of view, whichever of the two extremes it may chance to be.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.720]   Look at the case of Paul himself.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.640]   You get that in the ninth chapter of the book of Acts of the Apostles.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.400]   There on the road to Damascus he sees the risen Lord and says, "What wilt thou have
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.240]   me to do, Lord?"
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.880]   He becomes as helpless as a little child.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.040]   Undoubtedly, the Apostle at that point believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.240]   He saw it.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.440]   He was given the vision that enabled him to see it.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.120]   But this is what I read in verses 17 and 18.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.680]   A man called Ananias was called by the Lord.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.600]   The Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:29.440]   in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he prayeth, and hath
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.660]   seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.660]   receive his sight."
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.160]   Paul was rendered blind, you remember.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.920]   Well, then you go on.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.520]   The Lord said unto Ananias, "You did not seem to want to go.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.320]   Go thy way, for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.960]   kings, and the children of Israel; for I will show him how great things he must suffer for
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   my name's sake."
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.440]   Ananias went his way, and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.560]   "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way, as thou camest,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:07.480]   hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.320]   He doesn't instruct him on the way of salvation, but he is sent to heal him and to fill him
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.120]   with the Holy Ghost, to give him the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.080]   And immediately there fell from his eyes, as it had been scales, "And he received,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.720]   sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized."
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.640]   You see, he received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, or the other way around.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.300]   It doesn't matter at all.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.680]   And when he received meat, he was strengthened.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   And Saul, certain days, with the disciples, which were at Damascus, and straightway he
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.440]   preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.040]   Very well, there is another striking example of the same thing.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:55.920]   I come to my last example from the book of the Acts of the Apostles this morning.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.080]   I am not going to use the case of Apollos.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.940]   I believe it could be used quite easily.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.320]   It seems to me this is the only adequate explanation of the case of Apollos.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   This was the thing that Priscilla and Aquila recognized as lacking in Apollos, and of which
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.880]   they told him, and it made all the difference to him.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.800]   But leaving that out of account, come to the nineteenth chapter at the beginning.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:23.000]   And you read, "It came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.900]   through the upper coast, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples," and you remember
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:34.080]   we have seen the full connotation of that, it always means believers in the Lord Jesus
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:40.360]   Christ in the book of Acts, without a single exception, "and finding certain disciples,
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:46.400]   he said unto them, Have ye received the holy ghost, since ye believed?"
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.800]   All right, I know what you want to say, and you are quite right.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.840]   You say you are reading from the authorized version.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.040]   I am.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.800]   You say that is not the right translation.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.040]   I agree.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.120]   So let me give it to you in the revised and the other translations.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.840]   Did you receive the holy ghost when you believed?
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.560]   Right, that is the correct translation.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:16.480]   And of course it shows that the old authorized translation is after all not wrong.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.360]   Have you received the holy ghost since you believed?
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.120]   The implication there obviously is, of course, that you can believe without receiving the
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.440]   holy ghost, that it happens to you afterwards.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.200]   But all right, you say the other is the correct translation.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.740]   Did you receive the holy ghost when you believed?
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.560]   But what does that tell us?
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.160]   Well that tells us that it is obvious that you can believe without receiving the holy
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   ghost.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.600]   Let me use an illustration which I think I have used before.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.580]   You may say to me, "I had a cold last week."
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.840]   Can I put to you this one question?
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.960]   Did you run a temperature when you had your cold last week?
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   What does that question mean?
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.680]   Well it obviously means this, that you may have a cold without running a temperature.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.600]   On the other hand, you may run a temperature when you have a cold.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.320]   I want to know did you or didn't you?
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.500]   And that is the very question that was put here by the apostle.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:20.240]   It is possible for a man to be baptized with the holy ghost virtually simultaneously with
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   his belief.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.080]   Take the case now of Cornelius and his household.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.160]   You remember that there we are told in the tenth chapter of this book of Acts that as
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:35.520]   Peter was still speaking, the holy ghost fell upon them.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:44.200]   It seems that the baptism with the holy spirit happened as they were believing, almost simultaneously.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.660]   But it is clear from the question put by the apostle that that is not always the case,
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:55.720]   that it is possible for a man to believe without receiving the holy ghost.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.560]   Did you receive the holy ghost when you believed?
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.280]   Paul obviously saw there was something wrong with these people, there was a defect.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.880]   So he puts this question.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.720]   He was quite clearly of the opinion himself that they had not been baptized with the holy
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.840]   ghost.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.760]   So he puts it in the form of a question.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.560]   When you believed, were you baptized with the holy ghost?
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.600]   So that you see, even the revised translation and the others come to exactly the same thing
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:28.100]   in the end as the old authorized translation, except that these others are more accurate.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.460]   From the purely linguistic standpoint, the authorized translation is wrong.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.840]   But as so often, these authorized translators, they get the right point, the right meaning.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.940]   They overemphasize it a little bit, as if it is always something subsequent.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:48.380]   But what is established beyond any doubt is that one can be a believer without being baptized
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.740]   by the holy ghost.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:55.060]   But if that does not satisfy you, and it should, listen to this.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.220]   Paul addresses these men and he gives them further instruction.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:05.980]   So I read in verse 5, "When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   Jesus."
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.100]   The apostle is perfectly happy about these men, that they are true believers.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.900]   They have had John's baptism only.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.420]   He says, "But you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.540]   So he baptized them now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:27.460]   They are true believers, children of God, but still they have not been baptized with
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.580]   the holy ghost.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:39.820]   Because I read this in verse 6, "When Paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy ghost
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:46.700]   came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied."
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:53.180]   Now there is an absolute proof that you can be a true believer in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.540]   and still not be baptized with the holy ghost.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.980]   That case proves it twice over.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.540]   The question at the beginning, what actually happened subsequently?
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.980]   This interval, this differentiation.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.460]   The time element is not the important one.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:19.340]   The important point is that there is a difference, that there is a distinction between believing
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.560]   and being baptized with the holy ghost.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.300]   So I give you my last bit of evidence, which is in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.780]   the first chapter of the thirteenth verse.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.660]   And with this we close.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:39.420]   Paul now is reminding these Gentile Christians of how they became Christians.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:48.100]   In whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:54.620]   In whom also, after that he believed, he was sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.540]   is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession and
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.180]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:06.260]   All right, you say again, authorize translation once more, and again they've made exactly
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.620]   the same mistake.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:12.500]   In whom also, after that he believed, shouldn't be that.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.500]   What should it be?
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:20.740]   Well, as the revised has got it, in whom also believing, he were baptized with the holy
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.740]   ghost.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:29.820]   You see, once more, it doesn't make any difference to the meaning and to the truth.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.420]   It is only the believer who is baptized with the holy ghost or who receives the seal of
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   the spirit.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.260]   In whom believing, he were baptized.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:43.300]   It's the same order again.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.500]   The believing is the first thing.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:51.460]   Being baptized is something that doesn't of necessity happen at the same time.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:56.140]   It may, it may not, but it is distinct and separate, so the apostle does separate them.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:02.820]   In whom believing, you were also sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which is the
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:10.340]   earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.780]   Very well then, that's our first great principle.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.500]   I'm afraid we've got to leave it at that this morning.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:23.660]   All I am trying to establish is this, that the teaching which tells us that every man
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:30.700]   at his regeneration is baptized of necessity with the holy ghost, is a contradiction of
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.140]   the plain teaching of the scripture.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:41.580]   You can be regenerate without being baptized with the holy ghost.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:47.060]   And the scriptures that I've reduced to you show quite plainly and clearly that to
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:53.500]   say as so many have said in this century and so many are still saying, that every man at
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:00.980]   regeneration is baptized with the holy ghost, is simply to fly in the face of this plain
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:06.420]   explicit teaching of the holy scriptures.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:16.260]   God willing, as I say, we shall go on with this all important subject next Sunday morning.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.740]   Now let us sing our closing hymn, which is hymn number 206.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.740]   206.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:29.500]   Come, holy spirit, come, let thy bright beams arise, dispel the darkness from our minds
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:36.500]   and open all our eyes.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.500]   206.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   Come, holy spirit, come, let thy bright beams arise, dispel the darkness from our minds
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   and open all our eyes.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.500]   207.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:26.500]   May thy loving face, O Lord, my guilty good, and in your grace our prayers obey, O Almighty
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   God.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.500]   208.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   It is thy good plan, O God, to sanctify the soul, to perfect the healing power, the beauty
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.500]   and the word.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:50:18.500]   209.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:25.900]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:34.860]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:40.740]   and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:46.900]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship and the
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:53.900]   communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder of this
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:03.660]   hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we shall be in the glory
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.660]   everlasting.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.300]   Amen.
