[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   It doesn't require some effort in terms of learning how to do this stuff.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.180]   You know, of course it does, but is the juice worth the squeeze?
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.060]   Well, yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.680]   I mean, we travel like this all the time.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.360]   My family travels very frequently.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.700]   I do find awards.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.440]   It does require a slightly different perspective in terms of how
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   you look at booking travel.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   You put in a little bit of effort and you can be flying first
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.940]   class for next to nothing.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.960]   And that is a pretty fantastic feeling, you know, with a modicum of effort, you
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.060]   can save yourself tons and tons of money, or what I often tell people is I spend
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.220]   less money than most people I know on vacation, but I get far more vacations
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.580]   and far more comfortable experiences because you do have plenty of those
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.560]   opportunities to travel around the world and feel like you're not paying for it.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.140]   To be honest.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.120]   I mean, you'll pay your award taxes and fees, but when you're using Monopoly
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.220]   money to pay for the ticket and you're still getting the champagne and the
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.460]   caviar and the onboard chef or the shower or whatever it might be, it
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.760]   certainly feels pretty incredible.
