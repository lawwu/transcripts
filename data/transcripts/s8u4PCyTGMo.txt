[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   I was taught that one should do higher repetition movements with lighter weights in order to
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   warm up.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.520]   And then one of the things that did make a big positive difference for me in terms of
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.760]   strength and hypertrophy training was to do a moderate repetition warmup with a fairly
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.120]   lightweight, but then to actually keep the number of warmup repetitions fairly low and
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.560]   work progressively toward the first so-called work set.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.720]   When you say three to five, that's three to five work sets, correct?
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   Yep.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.240]   Are you also going to tell me three to five warmups?
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.240]   No.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.360]   Are you also going to tell me it has to be done between three and 5 p.m.?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.360]   So in terms of-
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.540]   With three to five friends?
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.240]   In all seriousness, what does a good warmup look like?
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.640]   And I realize this will vary depending on how cool your training environment is, time
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   of day, et cetera.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.520]   But as a kind of umbrella for a good warmup, what should people do?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120]   Well, you've already sort of jumped the gun with my answer.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.000]   It is honestly very dependent upon the person.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.800]   So some folks respond very well to a minimum warmup.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.640]   Others, I've had lots of actually professional fighters I've worked with where I actually
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.640]   have a major baseball player right now.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.160]   He's one of the best pitchers in the game, probably the best.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.280]   And the longer we warm up, the better his numbers get.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.240]   We actually did a vertical jump test with him.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.440]   He's going to kill me because he got so mad.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.720]   I wanted to see how long it sort of took him to reach a peak vertical jump.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.040]   And most times this takes people something like five to 10 sort of reps.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.760]   And I said, take it up all the way to a maximum vertical jump.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.120]   And then what I want you to do is continue jumping until you have three consecutive jumps
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.800]   or you're down lower than 90%.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.640]   And so what we're trying to look at is sort of when is he going to break?
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120]   Because in baseball, he's going to throw like 100 pitchers or so.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.680]   And we're trying to figure out when is his peak velocity on his fastball going to drop
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.760]   and sort of base his conditioning on that.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.960]   So it's a different style of conditioning.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   It's power endurance is really what it is.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.280]   He called me in the middle of it.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.240]   I'm like, oh, he done, whatever.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.080]   And he's just like, no, like how many of these am I supposed to do?
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.120]   And I was like, what are you talking about?
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.560]   He's like, I'm on rep 130 or something.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   And I was like, what?
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.560]   And I'm like, what rep did you peak on?
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.920]   He peaked on rep 70, something like that.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.440]   69, I think, technically, because he's goofy.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   So he's a classic example I've worked in for many, many years.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   We have a ton of data on him, a ton of biological data,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.160]   a ton of neuromuscular stuff, like all kinds of stuff.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.040]   And it just, the more he warms up, an absurd amount of warmup,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.080]   the better he gets.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.960]   And the better he gets in power production
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.920]   and the better he gets in speed and velocity.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.760]   So his warmup prior to games is, it's totally absurd.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   And just the more volume we throw at him, the better he does.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.000]   I have other folks, you get past like two or three reps
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.560]   and fatigue starts to set in.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.480]   And now you're actually like reducing power production.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.560]   So there is a ton of variation that goes in that.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   I can give you some guidelines though.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   You need to differentiate if you're training
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.240]   for speed, power, strength, or hypertrophy.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.800]   Here's why.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.120]   If we understand a little bit
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.920]   about what's causing the adaptation,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.560]   that's going to tell you what you need to do or avoid.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.440]   For example, volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.000]   Intensity is the primary driver
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.240]   in speed, power, and strength.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.800]   All right, what that means is,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.000]   you need to preserve intensity for the first three,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.320]   you need to preserve volume in the second one at most.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.240]   So if your warmup is so extensive
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.560]   in the hypertrophy training,
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.200]   that it compromises your training volume because of fatigue,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.800]   even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.360]   then you're actually probably walking yourself backwards
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.520]   by doing that extensive.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.360]   You would have been better off
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.440]   starting your first working set slightly suboptimal, right?
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.280]   'Cause it's not really,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.720]   you're just trying to accrue volume at that point.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.320]   Strength and power is the opposite.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.720]   Until you're moving very, very fast or powerfully,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.800]   you're not really causing the adaptation.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   So there's no point in starting your working set
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.280]   until you're really basically at 100%.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.200]   So the warmup should be as long as it takes you to get
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.240]   to where your mobility is in the right spot,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.600]   like your joints feel good, you feel fresh,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   you feel activated, and you really feel peak power.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.920]   Anything before that is a warmup set.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.240]   In the sport of Olympic weightlifting,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.520]   a lot of times the coaches will measure barbell velocity.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.960]   Travis Mash has done a fantastic job with this.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.800]   He's got a lot of data
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.040]   on what's called velocity-based training.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.440]   Brian Mann at Missouri and Miami, tons of work here.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.240]   And generally those communities
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.560]   are not going to count any repetition as a working set
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.500]   until you exceed 70% of your one rep max.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.920]   Where that's changed because of a lot of people
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.880]   doing the velocity-based stuff
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.280]   is now they're basing that simply on an achieved velocity.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.360]   And so really the warmup is irrelevant.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   They don't even, it's sort of just like do whatever you want
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   and we're gonna measure the barbell
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.920]   until you actually hit an outcome.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.000]   And now you're at what a working set.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.760]   So different ways to think about it,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.400]   depending on what you're training for,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.700]   that'll give you a little bit of a guideline.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.300]   If you're training for anything past hypertrophy,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.040]   then really, and especially even hypertrophy,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   it just comes down to, are you feeling ready to work?
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.240]   Are you cold?
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.140]   Are you moving through the correct positions?
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.000]   And if all those things are fine,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.380]   I don't care if you start a little bit early
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.080]   and save some gas at the end of it,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.260]   especially if you're a person like you
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.680]   who may be a bit more inclined to fatigue quickly
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.600]   relative to Trevor,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   who just has no response to fatigue whatsoever.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.000]   - Is it useful to do more warmup
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.720]   at the beginning of a workout,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   say before the first exercise,
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.080]   and then once one has achieved
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.560]   both local and systemic warmup, in air quotes,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   then perhaps on the second or third exercise,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.060]   fourth exercise, et cetera,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.940]   one or maybe even zero warmups.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.220]   - Yeah, fair point.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.420]   We generally think about warmups in a couple of ways.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.260]   This is a really actually,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.780]   this is a very clever question.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.660]   You wanna have some sort of general global warmup scheme.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.660]   We tend to prefer dynamic warmups.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.420]   So this is whole body movements
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.580]   rather than like sitting and stretching,
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.020]   static stretching, things like that.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.060]   - So something that involves momentum.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.780]   - Yeah, momentum or movement, right?
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.740]   So this is like,
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.600]   think about this in like old gym class.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.840]   It's like your high knees and your butt kickers
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.000]   and just different things like that,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.100]   where you're moving in different planes,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.000]   you're moving joints through tons of range of motion,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.840]   you're getting a lot of movement there.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.720]   So you're getting the local warmup,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.920]   you're also getting the total systemic activation,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.960]   everything else is going on there.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   So that is what we consider to be a general warmup.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.640]   Five minutes is a very sufficient number,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.840]   perhaps 10 if you're a slow goer,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.980]   achy and some things like that.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.180]   And you really gotta get the ankle warmed up
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.380]   if you're doing lower body stuff,
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.740]   really make sure that that's moving correctly.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.660]   The hips and knees will follow,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.580]   upper body stuff really get the shoulder blades
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.180]   and the neck, like making sure you're going there
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.220]   and the elbows will follow after that.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.720]   So five to seven minutes of a general warmup,
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.060]   a lot of the times like classic exercise science,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.960]   it will even just put you on a bike,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.020]   cycling for five minutes.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.980]   I don't like that personally,
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.180]   dynamic movement is more preferred.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.780]   If you really just move for five to seven minutes,
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.840]   you'll be fine there.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.440]   Now, specificity within each movement.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.560]   It's very important that your first exercise of the day
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.040]   is generally the thing you've prioritized.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.060]   That's oftentimes the most important you're going to do.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.800]   It oftentimes is also the most complex
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.040]   and the most moving parts.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.740]   So it tends to be multi-joint,
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.020]   therefore you need to have movement,
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.680]   precision and skill dialed, right?
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.920]   You don't typically start your workouts off
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.680]   with the forearm curl, right?
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.100]   Like that's, you don't need a tremendous amount of warmup
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.220]   to get going on that.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.380]   You're going to start off with medicine ball throws
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.700]   or a snatch or some agility work.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.300]   You need to have the whole system going
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.660]   because multiple joints are moving,
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.020]   position matters, technique.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.340]   There's just a lot of skill requirement, et cetera.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.460]   So the individualized workout
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.900]   or the specific workout for the specific movement
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.880]   for that very first one,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.900]   my general rule of thumb is like whatever it takes
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.940]   to move perfect in that first exercise.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.360]   Past that, you don't necessarily need to do
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   individualized warmups for your next movements
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.440]   unless it is a movement you're trying to learn
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.440]   or just even get a little bit better at.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.020]   Like drop the load a little bit,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.840]   work on some accruing some practice reps, fantastic.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.040]   Or it's another dissimilar complex movement.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.080]   So let's say your first exercise was a front squat
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.960]   and you got loaded for that
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.400]   and now you're going to move into a pull-up
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   but your mechanics aren't the best there
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.480]   and so you really need to change
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.520]   and do some maybe more specific activation warmups
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.760]   for that or something else
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.800]   or it's running or something totally different.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   So yeah, you don't need to rewarm up
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.920]   for every single exercise as you go.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.160]   Generally once you're good to go,
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.560]   the same muscles that you're going to use
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   in the next exercise are warm, same joints,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.760]   then you're good to go.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.440]   (upbeat music)
