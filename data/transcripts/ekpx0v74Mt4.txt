[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   us on this webinar and it's great to meet together in this online format to again study
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.600]   the Word of God and to be further trained in the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.420]   I hope and trust that you're all doing well in the Lord and that you're enjoying the blessings
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.360]   of Christ and we just rejoice in your faithfulness as you work through these essays.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.080]   We're praying for great fruit from this time as we dig deep into the Word of God and as
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.260]   we study these precious topics.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.960]   We do hope that you'll be encouraged in your own walk with Christ and also that you'll
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.640]   be equipped to minister these truths to others.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.460]   Tonight we are looking at the ACBC Theology exam number 16.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.840]   It is the subject of justification and sanctification by faith.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.560]   And in our study tonight, we're going to be making a transition from the doctrine of justification
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.400]   to the subject of sanctification.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.860]   Now as I mentioned previously in the seminar classes that the subject of sanctification
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.540]   is really where we live and where we breathe as biblical counselors.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.400]   We are helping people with the issues of sanctification and so it's very important that we are well
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.240]   equipped to think through the doctrine of sanctification and also apply this doctrine
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.200]   to our lives and to the lives of others.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.500]   So ACBC has at least three, if you kind of consider it broadly, there could be an argument
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.880]   that four or five of these essays deal with the subject of sanctification, but at least
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.660]   specifically speaking, three of the essay exams deal with the subject of sanctification
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.360]   and that's because of the great importance of this doctrine to the ministry of biblical
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.540]   counseling.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.920]   So in theology exam number 16, we're making that transition from the doctrine of justification
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.360]   to the doctrine of sanctification and I do hope and pray that your study of this topic
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.480]   will bear much fruit in your life and stir up a passion in your own life to pursue sanctification
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.060]   and holiness in your walk with Christ.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.180]   For tonight's devotional, I'd like to take us to Romans chapter 6 verses 1 to 4.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.360]   This is a wonderful passage of scripture that I've used in my own life and in my own counseling
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.620]   ministry to encourage counselees who are struggling with sanctification and by the way, I would
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.960]   just include, I would just mention that that should include us all, the broad category
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   of those who struggle with our sanctification should include really all Christians because
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.860]   we learn from scripture that sanctification is a battle, it is a fight, it is a war and
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.880]   it is indeed a struggle.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.980]   If you look at the Apostle Paul in Romans chapter 7 and you see him saying, "I do what
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.940]   I don't want to do and I don't do what I want to do," even the Apostle Paul wrestled with
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.940]   his sanctification.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.020]   Galatians chapter 5, the spirit sets itself against the flesh, the flesh sets its desires
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.500]   against the spirit and so you do not do what you please.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.940]   There is always this internal battle, this internal struggle in relation to sanctification.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.640]   So when I say that I use Romans chapter 6 verses 1 to 4 to encourage believers who are
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.880]   struggling with sanctification, I'm talking about a very large category of people.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.800]   I'd be very concerned with the believer who says that they have reached some level of
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.620]   spirituality where they are no longer battling for their sanctification, they're just kind
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.840]   of coasting their way to holiness.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.560]   I'd be very concerned about that believer that there would be a defective understanding
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.680]   of sanctification.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.700]   But Romans chapter 6 has really good news for anyone who is in the battle for their
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.360]   sanctification and let me just read this text for us.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.520]   It says there, "What shall we say then?
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.360]   By no means.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.340]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.520]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   his death?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.360]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.520]   In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father, we too
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.040]   might walk in newness of life."
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.920]   And let me just skip down to verse 7 of that passage where Paul says, "For one who has
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.480]   died has been set free from sin."
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.240]   Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.080]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.340]   Death no longer has dominion over him.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.200]   For the death he died, he died to sin once and for all, but the life he lives, he lives
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   to God.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.800]   So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.000]   Then in verse 12, Paul says, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to make
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.400]   you obey its passions.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.520]   Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.960]   to God as those who have been brought from death to life and your members to God as instruments
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.400]   for righteousness."
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   And here's the good news, verse 14, "For sin will have no dominion over you since you are
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.920]   not under law, but under grace."
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.680]   So as I've said, I've used this passage in counseling ministry to encourage believers
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:40.040]   who are doing battle for their sanctification, and the key thought that I just want us to
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.440]   think about tonight is simply this, and we're making, again, the transition from the doctrine
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.280]   of justification to the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.440]   The key thought is this.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.460]   Justification is by the grace of God.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.360]   We understand that, we've studied that, we've learned that.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.000]   It's not through works of the law, it is purely by God's unmerited favor alone.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.520]   And then the additional thought is that sanctification is by God's grace as well.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.560]   So we have good news to proclaim to the unbeliever who is dead in sins and trespasses.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.640]   We say to that unbeliever that your sin can be forgiven on the basis of what Christ has
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:34.580]   accomplished through his work on the cross and his glorious resurrection from the grave.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.760]   But we also have good news to proclaim to the believer, the believer who has received
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.380]   justification but still struggles with sin in his sanctification.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.420]   And the good news that we have to give to the believer is that Jesus died not only to
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.580]   free you from the penalty of sin, but Jesus died in order to free you from the power of
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.080]   sin.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:10.560]   Jesus died on the cross and he rose from the grave so that you may no longer live in bondage
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.040]   to sin.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:23.280]   You are no longer a slave to sin because Jesus lived and he died and he rose again.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.200]   That's good news and that's the good news that we have for our counselees.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:38.080]   I've sat with those in counseling ministry and just those who struggle with anger, who
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:45.320]   struggle with laziness, who struggle with anxiety, who struggle with depression.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.240]   Before I get into the practical applications of how they need to put off ungodly behavior
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.880]   and put on godly behavior, what I want to do is give believers hope.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.420]   I want to give my counselee hope.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:06.340]   And I've said to many counselees that I have hope that you can change.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.300]   Your tomorrow doesn't need to be the same as your yesterday.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.340]   You can be different.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.340]   You can grow.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.340]   You can change.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.180]   And I'm saying that not because I have confidence in you so much, but I have confidence in Christ
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.420]   and his saving work in you.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.820]   I have confidence that through your faith in Christ, you have been delivered from the
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.100]   power of sin and you are no longer a slave to sin.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.360]   Whatever the issue is, whatever the sin issue is, you are not a slave to sin.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.040]   You can grow and change.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.380]   And I say that on the authority of God's word.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:49.620]   And I just want to give counselees hope that they can change on the basis of what the scriptures
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.620]   say.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:59.140]   And I ground that in the teaching of Romans chapter six, Jesus died so that you may no
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:07.100]   longer live in bondage to whatever this sin issue is.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:13.620]   And so you make the transition from the doctrine of justification, imputed righteousness to
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:21.700]   the doctrine of sanctification, imparted righteousness.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.460]   So going back to Romans chapter six, verse one, Paul is just a detail, an explanation
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.140]   of the doctrine of justification in Romans chapters three to five.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.700]   He has said that we have been justified by faith.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.740]   We have received this imputed righteousness by grace alone through faith alone on the
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.980]   basis of Christ's work alone.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.300]   We have peace with God.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.380]   Romans five, verse one, we have this standing in grace.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.220]   We exalt in the hope of the glory of God.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:59.020]   We received all of this by God's grace alone, not by any works that we have done, not by
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.940]   any work of the law that we have completed.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.680]   And then he says in verse one of chapter six, what shall we say then?
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:14.100]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.340]   Martin Lloyd-Jones has made the observation that that is a surest test that you are preaching
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.140]   the gospel rightly.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.020]   If you preach the gospel rightly and you proclaim a gospel of grace alone, the question is going
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.020]   to come.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:33.880]   Do you really mean that because it's by grace alone that we can go ahead and sin?
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.420]   Because the more we sin, the more grace we receive.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.660]   He's going to give an answer to that question, but Lloyd-Jones is just saying that if that
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.060]   question arises as you preach the gospel, that is an indicator that you're doing it
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.180]   right.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.660]   If you safeguard the gospel of grace alone, someone's going to come along and ask the
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.460]   question, do you really mean Dan that we're saved by grace alone?
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.700]   Does that mean that I can continue to sin?
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.700]   Look at Paul's answer.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:11.220]   He uses the strongest Greek emphatic negative possible by no means.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.260]   May it never be.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.940]   One translation puts this absolutely not.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.340]   The King James versions translates this phrase, God forbid.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:30.580]   The paraphrase JB Phillips says, what a ghastly thought.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:38.220]   May we never think that the doctrine of justification by grace means that we can continue to live
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.340]   in sin instead.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:51.180]   In verse two, the apostle Paul says this, how can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:59.880]   Paul says that when Jesus died on the cross at Calvary, that you and I were united to
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.480]   him in his life, death, and resurrection so that when he died, we died.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.520]   And when he rose, we rose.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.200]   And I've said this to counselees and counseling ministry, cause you personalize it in the
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.460]   counseling session.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:21.360]   Did you know that when Jesus died on the cross, 2000 years at Calvary, you know that when
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:29.680]   he died, that you died with him, you were united to him in his death so that you died
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.160]   to your old life.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.840]   And did you know that when he rose from the grave on that glorious Sunday, that you rose
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.720]   with him to live a new life in Christ, that you are a new creature, new creature because
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:49.320]   of your faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.920]   Paul uses the imagery of baptism, not water baptism, but the concept of immersion, being
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.080]   fully immersed into Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.640]   He says, do you not know that all of us who have been literally immersed, baptized into
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.400]   Christ Jesus were baptized into his death.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.240]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:23.960]   raised from the dead by the glory of the father, we too might walk in newness of life.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.200]   That's what we want for each of our counselees.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.800]   Right there, verse four, we want them to walk in newness of life.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.160]   That's what we want for ourselves.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.000]   This is what I want for you as counselors in training.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.360]   This is what we want for our families, our loved ones.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:51.520]   We want them to experience the joy and the satisfaction of walking in newness of life,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:15:01.400]   to be filled with all of the good blessings of God and to walk in holiness and in sanctification.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:09.240]   And so justification is by the grace of God and sanctification is by God's grace as well.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.720]   So a helpful work that has helped me think through this.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.680]   And again, I'm trying to introduce this whole idea of in this essay, you're making the transition
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.800]   from the doctrine of justification to the doctrine of sanctification and a really good
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.880]   work that I would commend to you is Jerry Bridges book, transforming grace.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.640]   This is a book that I read when I was pretty early on in my Christian life and it really
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:42.440]   had a formative influence upon my thinking of the Christian life and of the doctrine
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   of salvation.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.240]   And he makes a point there that justification is being declared righteous before God through
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.880]   It's a point in time event.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.540]   It's the time in our lives when we are saved.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:00.160]   It is the Ephesians two verse eight experience for it is by grace you have been saved through
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   faith.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.400]   And then he transitions to sanctification.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.240]   He says, sanctification is our growth in Christ likeness.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:19.680]   It is a progressive experience covering our entire Christian lives from salvation to glorification.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.840]   This is glorification occurs at the time we depart from this life to be with Christ.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.720]   Now note Bridges observation and his thesis in this book.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.240]   I think it'll be helpful to you.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.320]   He says all true Christians readily agree that justification is by grace through faith
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320]   in Christ.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.240]   And if we stop to think about it, we agree that glorification is also solely by God's
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   grace.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.800]   Jesus purchased for us not only forgiveness of sins justification, but also eternal life
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.640]   glorification.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:06.300]   With sanctification, the entire Christian experience between justification and glorification
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.200]   is another story.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:16.120]   At best, the Christian life is viewed as a mixture of personal performance and God's
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.760]   grace.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.600]   So he goes on to say that our view of the Christian life could be illustrated by the
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.260]   following timeline, justification is based on grace.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.440]   Sanctification is based on works or human performance.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.500]   And then glorification is based on grace.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.960]   According to that illustration, our concept of the Christian life is a grace works grace
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   sequence.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:55.340]   He's trying to bring out the idea that this is how we tend to view our Christian lives.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:01.480]   Instead, the principal thesis of this book, the truth I hope to demonstrate is that the
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:09.960]   illustration should look like this justification based on grace, sanctification based on grace,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.080]   glorification based on grace.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.800]   Dear biblical counselors in training, can I just encourage you and ask you to evaluate
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.080]   is that your view of the Christian life?
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:30.000]   Do you believe that sanctification is entirely based upon the unmerited favor of God given
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.680]   to us through the work of Jesus on the cross?
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.840]   Or somehow have you come up with a method of sanctification that bypasses grace, bypasses
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:47.160]   Jesus and bypasses Christ's sufficient work on the cross?
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.760]   Because if you embrace the biblical view of sanctification, which I believe is represented
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:19:01.280]   in this table, what you then do is you bring into the counseling session with your counselee
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:10.540]   a message of hope and a message of encouragement that God is going to give his grace to you
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.080]   as you work through this sanctification issue.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.280]   His grace will be sufficient for you.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   Christ's work on the cross is to be applied to this particular counseling issue and empowers
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.200]   you to grow and to change in Christ.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:38.680]   By the way, dear friends, this is why we in the biblical counseling ministry offer to
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.660]   our counselees what no secular system could ever hope to offer.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.840]   Secular psychology cannot offer this message of grace and hope that is based upon Christ's
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.440]   work on the cross and him alone.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.840]   And we need to be equipped to apply this message of grace to the counseling issues that we
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.180]   encounter in our ministry.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.080]   Now with that said, let me pray briefly.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   I'll get into our essay topic for tonight, but I do hope that was a good primer from
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   the doctrine of justification to sanctification, which we're going to be focusing on in this
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.720]   session and then in the sessions to come.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.560]   We're going to be right there in the middle of that table there.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.160]   We're going to be looking at sanctification, which is based on the grace of God and his
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   grace alone.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.680]   Let me pray for us.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.480]   Father, we thank you that we come to you by your grace, by your mercy, through the work
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.080]   of your son, Jesus Christ, and because of that, we have hope for change in our lives
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.120]   and change in the lives of those whom we minister to.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.480]   We believe that we are not in bondage to sin.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.800]   We are not slaves to sin.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.620]   We praise you for that.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.240]   We praise you that whatever the counseling issue is, either in our lives or in the lives
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.120]   of our counselees, that your all sufficient grace is enough.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.360]   It is sufficient that we have the power to grow and change.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:18.500]   We thank you for Christ and his perfect work, and we thank you that we are no longer living
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.280]   with sin as the cruel master over our lives.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:30.160]   We just pray that we would make that truth a reality in our own practical living and
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.720]   that you would help us to minister this truth to others.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.400]   So we give you our time together in Jesus name.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   Amen.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   Okay.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440]   Okay.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.520]   We're looking at theology exam number 16 tonight, and on your first page of your handout,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.880]   you have the question there to define faith in biblical terms, explaining its relationship
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.240]   to justification and sanctification.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:58.880]   So we're making the transition from justification to sanctification.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.600]   I would break this essay up into three parts.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   What the essay exam is asking you to do is first of all, to define faith in biblical
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.400]   terms.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   The second thing that the essay is asking you to do is explain the relation of faith
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.360]   to the doctrine of justification.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.520]   And then the third thing that the essay is asking you to do is to explain the relation
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.480]   of faith to the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.680]   So if you were to take this question and break it up, what are the things that they're asking
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   you to do?
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.440]   They're asking you to define faith in biblical terms, explain the relationship of faith to
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:50.760]   justification and then explain the relation of faith to the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.200]   So here's the good news with this exam.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:01.440]   The good news is that you've pretty much already studied the first two aspects of this question.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.000]   If you have completed theology exam number 14 and theology exam number 15, then you've
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.360]   covered the first two aspects of this question.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.360]   You've studied it.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   You should know it.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:21.120]   What you need to do in this exam question is really just summarize the content of theology
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.840]   exam number 14 and 15.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.800]   So the first aspect there to define faith in biblical terms, you've already written
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:38.680]   on that subject, and that will be a review of theology exam number 14.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:45.600]   You'll remember from that exam you wrote on the components of what faith is, that there's
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:53.240]   an intellectual component of knowledge, just knowing the truth of Scripture.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:00.680]   There is the emotional aspect of faith, which is being convicted or convinced of what the
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.720]   Word of God is and how it applies to your life, and then there is the volitional aspect
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:14.080]   of faith, which is actually placing your reliance or your trust, your confidence in the finished
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.400]   work of Jesus Christ for your salvation.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.760]   So you should have already written on that topic.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.680]   You should be acquainted with that topic, and if you need some review, you can go back
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:30.360]   to our session on theology exam number 14.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.440]   So a good strategy for writing this essay, theology exam number 16, is to go back and
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:44.320]   then summarize in one paragraph some of the main features of what faith is in biblical
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.080]   terms.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.880]   So you wrote like a page and a half on this topic.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.560]   You're going to take just some of the salient points of that material and summarize it in
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   one paragraph.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:03.820]   That would be a suggested way to address the first aspect of this essay exam.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:09.080]   If you're repeating any material as you work through the theology exams, you can use the
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:21.200]   writing device, quote, "As already discussed in theology exam number 14, faith is blank,"
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.560]   and then end quote of that material.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.920]   So you can use that writing device to say, "As I've already explained in theology exam
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.160]   number 14," and then go ahead and you can repeat some of that material but summarize
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.400]   it in a much more condensed fashion for this essay.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.240]   You don't have to use that writing device.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.320]   You can go ahead and just summarize it and just put the material again, but some students
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:53.440]   feel like some of these essays, they're kind of repeating things that they've written before,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.320]   and if you want, you can use that writing device and say, "As I've already discussed
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.800]   or as already discussed in a prior essay," and then go ahead and repeat some of that
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.840]   material.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:14.360]   The second aspect of that exam is asking you to explain the relation of faith to the doctrine
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.440]   of justification.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.360]   That's going to be a review of theology exam number 15.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.400]   Again, you can use that writing device.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:30.480]   As already discussed in theology exam number 15, justification is by faith alone apart
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.500]   from works of the law or something like that.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.800]   You can go ahead and summarize some of that.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:44.040]   But a good approach to this essay would be to go ahead and address the first aspect in
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.640]   a paragraph, address the second aspect in a paragraph as well.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:58.480]   For this essay, you're really focusing in on the fact that justification is by faith.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.560]   It's not by works of the law.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   You don't need to get into all of the issues of double imputation and imputed righteousness.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:15.500]   You really want to focus in on the key scriptures which distinguish biblical justification from
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.080]   the idea that you can become righteous by performing works of the law.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.280]   But you should have already studied that material from last week, and you should already have
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.880]   a really good head start on the second aspect of this essay.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:40.240]   The real new material that you're going to be developing in this exam question is in
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:51.260]   relation to the third component here, explain the relation of faith to the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:57.360]   That's the new ground that you're going to be covering in this essay.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:04.020]   Again, as I mentioned, you're going to be writing some additional essays on this doctrine
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.040]   of sanctification, so save some of your firepower.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.320]   This essay exam is not designed for you to write everything that there is to say about
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   sanctification.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:23.040]   It's really designed for you to introduce the subject of sanctification, to distinguish
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:33.300]   sanctification from justification, and talk about how sanctification is by faith.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.200]   It's not to get into everything that there is to say about sanctification, as we will
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.840]   see in further sessions.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.560]   Just to make that note, there's a lot you can say about sanctification.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:54.240]   We're really here interested in two aspects, I'll give you the two bullet points here under
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.160]   component number three.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:04.040]   We're really interested in the issue of how does sanctification relate to justification,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   and then we're interested in passages dealing with sanctification by faith, or the crucial
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:17.520]   issue of faith in our sanctification.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:24.160]   You're going to want to hit those two sub points in this essay, and so this would be
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:30.360]   just a suggested strategy to write the essay, is to find faith in biblical terms, explain
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.280]   the relation of faith to the doctrine of justification, and then explain the relation of faith to
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.560]   the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:44.480]   That's a three to four paragraph essay, if you want to do it that way, but I would use
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.920]   the first two paragraphs to summarize the material from Theology exam 14 and 15, and
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   then break some new ground in talking about how does sanctification relate to justification,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:05.160]   and deal with the passages which concern sanctification by faith.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:11.360]   So if you look at your handout, I have some suggested material there on reading that's
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:17.740]   going to help you do this, Wayne Grudem and Paul Enns are some helpful works that will
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.680]   help you think through justification and sanctification, and then I really want to encourage you to
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   read J.C. Ryle on this subject.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:31.620]   He's got some very good material, he has a chapter on sanctification from the larger
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:40.120]   book called Holiness, and by the way, if you want to spend some money, $10 or so, get the
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.240]   whole book, J.C. Ryle, Holiness.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:50.840]   That is just an amazing, excellent read that has made such an impact on my life, and it's
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.200]   just one of those books that every Christian should read, J.C. Ryle, Holiness.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.560]   Well, he has one chapter in that book that they've actually posted online, so if you
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.160]   don't want to spend any money, you can just look at it online and get that from the link
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.160]   there.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.960]   That's going to help you think through what is sanctification, and how does it relate
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.420]   to justification, and then there's another work that's been placed online as well that's
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:25.000]   available for free, and that is justification and sanctification, how do they differ, and
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.680]   that is a very helpful work that's also available online.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:41.640]   Now let me move to page two of your handout there and just give you some thoughts on this
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.540]   as it relates to a definition of faith.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:53.360]   As we noted, that's the first element of this essay is to summarize a definition of faith,
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.560]   and so this is just going to be a brief review from Theology Exam number 14.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.480]   Charles Ryrie says that faith means confidence, trust to hold something as true.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:12.400]   Just make the note there that the terms faith, trust, believe are really synonymous.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:19.580]   They're used interchangeably in scripture, and so faith means to place your confidence
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:27.520]   in something or someone, to place your trust in something or someone, and then as it relates
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:33.600]   to saving faith, Wayne Grudem writes that saving faith is trust in Jesus Christ as a
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:41.040]   living person for forgiveness of sins and for eternal life, and we mentioned that there
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.860]   are three components to saving faith.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:50.440]   There is the intellectual aspect, a person must have knowledge, Paul Enns writes this
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:56.100]   involves the intellect and emphasizes that there are certain basic truths that must be
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.240]   believed for salvation.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.560]   So Romans chapter 10 verse 14, how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.280]   and how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard and how are they to
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.380]   hear without someone preaching?
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:24.240]   So there must be knowledge of objective truth in order for a person to be saved, and yet
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.480]   as the scriptures teach us, knowledge alone is not enough to save.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:37.220]   James 2 verse 19 says you believe that God is one, you do well, even the demons believe
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.060]   and shudder.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:47.220]   So even the demons have an intellectual understanding of who Jesus is and they have an intellectual
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.000]   understanding of the Bible.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.800]   So knowledge is necessary, but knowledge is not enough.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:07.140]   There must also be number two, the emotional aspect of faith, which can be labeled as conviction.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:12.700]   So a person with intellectual knowledge says that all have sinned and fall short of the
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.020]   glory of God.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.160]   A person who has conviction says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.240]   and I am a sinner and I need salvation.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:33.540]   Paul Enns explains helpfully that conviction involves the emotions.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.140]   This element emphasizes that the person has not only an intellectual awareness of the
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:44.820]   truths, but that there is an inner conviction of their truthfulness.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:51.700]   As it says in Acts chapter 2 verse 37, now when they heard this, they were cut to the
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:35:00.100]   heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, brothers, what shall we do?
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.020]   Now I've experienced this, haven't you?
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:09.300]   The word of God just so pierces your heart that you're convinced and convicted of your
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.460]   need to change, your need for repentance.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:20.460]   It's not just, yeah, I know that that's true for everyone in the world, but it's, this
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:26.460]   is true for me and I have come under the conviction of God's word.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.220]   Zacchaeus, the tax collector, didn't just say, well, intellectually, I agree that everyone
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:41.460]   is a sinner, but he said in Luke chapter 19 verse 8, behold, Lord, the half of my goods
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.100]   I give to the poor and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:54.020]   And Jesus said, today salvation has come to this house for the son of man came to seek
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.820]   and save the loss.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:04.100]   Zacchaeus intellectually understood his need of salvation, but then emotionally he had
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:11.540]   come under conviction that he needed this grace, he needed salvation, and he needed
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:16.020]   to repent of his unjust dealings with people.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.740]   So there is the intellectual aspect, the emotional aspect, and there is number three, the volitional
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:36.740]   aspect, the aspect of trust, faith, trust, believing, those terms are used interchangeably
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:42.740]   in scripture, you can intellectually understand, you can emotionally respond, but until you
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:51.360]   volitionally place your trust in Christ and rely on him for your salvation, you will not
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360]   be saved.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:58.420]   It's one thing to look at a chair, to know that it can hold you, and it is another thing
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:05.500]   to sit in the chair and allow the chair to bear the weight that you bring upon it.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:15.300]   And this is the aspect of the volitional aspect of salvation.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   You understand who Christ is, you are convinced of your need for him, but have you trusted
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   him?
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:33.200]   Have you renounced your reliance on your self-righteousness and placed your trust in Jesus for your salvation?
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:41.460]   So a good essay on this subject is just going to review some of this material of the definition
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.480]   of faith.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.440]   You have the relationship of faith to salvation.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.800]   Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, for by grace you have been saved through
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.760]   faith and this is not your own doing.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:02.600]   It is the gift of God, not a result of work so that no one may boast.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:08.860]   We are saved by faith and faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:16.440]   It always produces the fruit of good works, verse 10 goes on to say, for we are his workmanship
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:23.780]   created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.780]   in them.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:32.640]   We're not saved by our works, but we are saved unto good works.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.520]   So move to the next page of your handout.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:43.160]   You have a review of theology exam number 15, the doctrine of justification by faith.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:49.840]   Man is justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.180]   The Westminster Catechism says justification is an act of God's free grace, wherein he
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:03.340]   pardoned all our sins and accepted us as righteous in his sight only for the righteousness of
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.060]   God imputed to us and received by faith alone.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:14.520]   And then I've listed numerous references there in the book of Romans, which really
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:22.260]   emphasize the fact that justification is the free gift of God received by faith alone apart
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.700]   from any works of the law.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:30.340]   I'll mention briefly Romans 3, verse 20, for by works of the law, no human being will be
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:36.800]   justified in his sight since through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.660]   But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:46.540]   law and the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.700]   Christ for all who believe.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:56.260]   As we've mentioned, faith itself is not a meritorious act.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:03.080]   It really is the declaration of spiritual bankruptcy.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:08.220]   Faith says, "Nothing in my hands I bring, only to thy cross I cling.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   I've nothing to offer, nothing to add to my salvation.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.180]   All of my works are but filthy rags."
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.060]   Person with faith declares spiritual bankruptcy.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:26.460]   Jesus described this as the beatitude attitude, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.780]   is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:34.980]   Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:43.340]   And it is not the greatness of our faith that saves, it is the greatness of the object of
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.740]   our faith that saves.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:54.860]   So faith is not some kind of meritorious act that somehow earns our way into God's favor.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.860]   B.B.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:01.140]   Warfield has said, "It is not, strictly speaking, even faith in Christ that saves, but Christ
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.100]   that saves through faith.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:10.260]   The saving power resides exclusively not in the act of faith or the attitude of faith
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.020]   or nature of faith, but in the object of faith."
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:19.540]   I think that's a very good point, and it is well said.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:25.380]   Tim Keller has observed, "It is not the strength of your faith, but the object of your faith
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.700]   that actually saves you.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:36.940]   Strong faith in a weak branch is fatally inferior to weak faith in a strong branch."
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.060]   And I'm so glad that is true.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:46.860]   So in this portion of the essay, you want to summarize the teaching that justification
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:52.780]   is by faith apart from the works of the law, and then let me move you to the next page
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:58.020]   of your handout.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:05.380]   Let's talk through the issue of sanctification by faith, sanctification by faith.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:11.700]   Now, again, you're not going to say everything that could be said about sanctification in
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.740]   this essay, but you are going to cover some key truths, and here's some things I want
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:26.380]   to kind of lay before you and ask you to think about and to write about in your essay for
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:34.140]   exam number 16, and the first would be the distinction between justification and sanctification.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:39.140]   The distinction between justification and sanctification, as we mentioned, justification
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:46.400]   is imputed righteousness, it is God crediting to our account the righteousness of Christ
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.660]   at the moment of conversion.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:55.580]   God gives us the perfect record of Jesus Christ as a gift, and we receive it in full at the
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.420]   moment of conversion.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:04.700]   So we are never more justified than we were on the day we were saved.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:11.780]   Our sanctification does not improve upon our justification, we're not more justified as
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.940]   we grow more sanctified.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:21.860]   Our justification is complete, it is final, it is perfect.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:30.700]   But then sanctification deals with imparted righteousness or practical righteousness.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:37.900]   The two must be distinguished but never separated.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.420]   So let's pick that statement apart.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:47.780]   If you fail to distinguish between justification and sanctification, you end up with a Catholic
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:53.380]   view of justification and sanctification.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:44:02.420]   The Catholic view is that justification is not a pronouncement, justification is a process.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:08.520]   The Catholic view of salvation and the Christian life is that you become more justified the
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:15.620]   more you become sanctified, and that causes all sorts of confusion in the Christian life.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:22.620]   So we must take pains to distinguish justification, a completed act, from sanctification, an ongoing
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.520]   process.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   J.C.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.780]   Ryle has written this, "Justification is the reckoning and counting a man to be righteous
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:39.540]   for the sake of another, even Jesus Christ the Lord.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:44.380]   Sanctification is the actual making a man inwardly righteous, though it may be in a
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.920]   very feeble degree.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.100]   Justification is a finished and complete work.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:55.260]   Sanctification is an imperfect work comparatively and will never be perfected until we reach
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.720]   heaven.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.160]   Justification admits of no growth or increase.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.060]   Sanctification is eminently a progressive work and admits of continual growth and enlargement
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.580]   so long as a man lives.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.460]   Sanctification gives us our title to heaven and boldness to enter in.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:20.540]   Sanctification gives us our meatness, an old word for suitability for heaven, and prepares
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.840]   us to enjoy it when we dwell there."
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:34.800]   Ryle says, "It can never be too strongly impressed on our minds that they are two separate things.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:40.980]   That they cannot be separated, and everyone that is a partaker of either is a partaker
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.560]   of both.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.680]   But never, never ought they to be confounded, and never ought the distinction between them
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.180]   to be forgotten."
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:57.820]   So if you fail to distinguish justification from sanctification, you end up with a Catholic
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:03.780]   view of the Christian life and of salvation.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:11.620]   But if you fail to hold them together, if you somehow separate them so that sanctification
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:19.020]   is an optional add-on to justification, if you somehow buy into this idea that a man
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:27.540]   can be justified without also being sanctified, then you end up in the error of antinomianism,
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:34.860]   which is a critical theological error, which basically says that a man can be justified
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.540]   and then live however he wants.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.180]   Paul says, "May it never be.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.680]   God forbid.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:48.420]   The two must be distinguished, justification and sanctification, but they must always be
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.420]   held together.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.940]   They are inseparable."
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:59.620]   In other words, no one is justified without also being sanctified, at least to some degree.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:08.200]   No one just receives the grace of justification without also receiving the grace of sanctification.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.380]   So Ryle is taking pains.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:14.900]   I would really encourage you to read those two works that are placed online.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:22.240]   He's taking pains to hold these two expressions of grace together while at the same time distinguishing
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:28.700]   them so that a person does not labor under the idea that I've got to be more sanctified
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:35.740]   because I'm afraid that I am not justified, when the reality theologically is that it's
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.740]   the very opposite.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:44.820]   It's because we are rejoicing in our justification that we are empowered and we are motivated
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.420]   to pursue our sanctification.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:52.440]   Our justification is not in doubt.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:58.340]   So that leads us to the second point here, the necessity of sanctification.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:06.220]   Letter B, Paul moves on from justification in Romans chapter five to sanctification in
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.180]   Romans chapter six.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:16.380]   We covered this passage in the introductory thoughts here, but the key idea here is that
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:25.740]   grace not only pardons the sinner, but grace empowers the sinner to live a holy life.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:32.380]   Grace not only forgives sin, grace also transforms the believer so that the believer no longer
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:40.860]   loves his or her sin but desires to live in holiness and in righteousness.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:46.700]   John Calvin has said this, "Christ justifies no man without also sanctifying him.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:52.180]   These blessings are conjoined by a perpetual and inseparable tie.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.980]   Those whom he enlightens by his wisdom, he redeems.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.860]   Whom he redeems, he justifies.
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.060]   Whom he justifies, he sanctifies.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:10.500]   Although we distinguish between them, they are both inseparably comprehended in Christ."
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:16.180]   First Corinthians 1 verse 30 says, "And because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who became
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:22.580]   to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:30.860]   So, let me move you to the next page here on your handout, and I think I've shown you
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:39.380]   this table before, but in justification, you have positional righteousness, sanctification,
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:44.100]   you have practical righteousness.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.060]   Justification is instantaneous.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.460]   Sanctification is progressive.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.860]   In justification, we're free from sin's penalty.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.640]   In sanctification, we're free from sin's power.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:02.500]   In justification, Paul deals with justification in Romans chapter 3 to 5, and then sanctification
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.980]   in Romans 6 and 7.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:10.940]   But the thing that the two have in common is that justification is by faith, and then
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:17.660]   to the point of this essay, sanctification is by faith as well.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:27.700]   So, letter C, a definition for sanctification, I'll just briefly touch on this and then we'll
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.100]   get into the last portion of this teaching.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:38.140]   But Anthony Hokema has a great work called Saved by Grace.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:44.060]   It's a book that's written on the doctrine of salvation, soteriology.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:49.820]   That's a work, again, if you've got $10 or so, I would highly encourage you to have that
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.460]   on your bookshelf and to read through that.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:57.380]   But he has a chapter there on sanctification, which has a really good definition.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:03.740]   He says, "We may define sanctification as that gracious operation of the Holy Spirit
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.420]   involving our responsible participation by which he delivers us from the pollution of
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:14.020]   sin, renews our entire nature according to the image of God, and enables us to live lives
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.100]   that are pleasing to him.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   Sanctification empowers us to think will and love in a way that glorifies God, to think
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:27.140]   God's thoughts after him, and to do what is in harmony with his will."
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:32.060]   I'll just make a note there that we're going to come back to this definition in the later
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:43.080]   essays as we deal with the issue of synergistic sanctification, how man works and God works
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.780]   in sanctification.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:51.000]   We work out our salvation with fear and trembling before it is God who has worked in us to will
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.820]   and to work for his good pleasure.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:52:01.080]   We're going to deal with the issue of past, present, and future sanctification.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.140]   Those are topics which are to come.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:06.700]   But just note here that that's a really good definition that we're going to refer back
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.300]   to in our study.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:15.620]   I think it captures a lot of the biblical teaching on sanctification.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:22.380]   For our purpose in this essay, Theology Exam #16, we just want you to grab a hold of the
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:30.980]   simple definition that sanctification is the process of a believer becoming more holy.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:36.700]   The idea of being holy needs to be set apart.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:44.180]   The believer is practically being set apart from sin and consecrated unto God.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.780]   We'll talk through the past, present, and future aspects of that.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:54.340]   We have been, in the past, sanctified.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.980]   We'll find that in the Scriptures, that this word "sanctification" is used in the past
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.840]   tense, that we have been sanctified.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:09.900]   There has been this decisive break from sin and sin's power that has occurred at the moment
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.020]   of our conversion.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:18.360]   But because we have been sanctified in the past, we are being sanctified in the present.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:24.000]   We are continually, on a daily basis, being conformed to the likeness of Christ and being
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.460]   made more holy, more consecrated on a practical level to the purposes of God.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:37.540]   And then one day, we will, in the future, be perfectly sanctified, perfectly or ultimately
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:46.840]   completely set apart from sin and sin's influences and consecrated unto God's purposes.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.600]   But for this essay, we just want you to get a hold of the idea that sanctification is
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.040]   the process of becoming more holy.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:01.160]   It's the present, if you look at the present aspect of sanctification, it is the process
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:07.180]   of becoming more holy in our Christian lives.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:13.820]   A number of passages there, but I'll just mention 1 Corinthians 1 verse 2.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:21.220]   I love this statement written to the church at Corinth, which had a lot of issues with
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:25.120]   their practical sanctification, as you know.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:31.420]   But Paul says there, "To the church of God that is at Corinth, to those sanctified, haggiazo,
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.620]   in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, haggios, together with all those who in every place
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:42.460]   call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours."
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:49.220]   We are called to pursue sanctification because we are the saints.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:57.460]   Sainthood is not some second level of spirituality that is earned through the Christian life.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:04.940]   It is the status of every believer in Christ, that you are a saint because you have been
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:11.060]   set apart unto God.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:18.400]   For this essay, we just want you to introduce the subject of sanctification and just get
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:25.580]   a hold of that idea that sanctification is the process of becoming more holy in the Christian
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.580]   life.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:31.300]   Now, let me move you to the last page and I'll spend a few minutes on this as we wrap
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.740]   up our time together.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:43.660]   The role of faith in our sanctification.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:53.940]   Now, I just find this to be incredibly encouraging as well as, I think, a necessary balance in
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.340]   a lot of the ways that we think about sanctification.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.940]   And I'll just ask you tonight to evaluate in your own life.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:12.500]   When you think about becoming more holy, when you think about growing to overcome sin, growing
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:20.700]   to be like Christ, when you think about the process of becoming more godly, how often
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:31.660]   do you think of that process in terms of growing in faith, growing in your trust in the Lord
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.880]   Jesus Christ?
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:44.120]   Do you tend to think of the process of becoming more holy in terms of doing more disciplines
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:53.680]   or doing more duties, or do you think of it in terms of growing in faith, growing strong
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:57:01.440]   in faith, learning to grow in your trust and your reliance and your confidence in the Lord
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:09.480]   Jesus Christ in all that he has done for your life and for believers?
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:16.800]   Do you think of the process of becoming more sanctified in terms of faith, or do you think
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.520]   of it in terms more of doing things?
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:26.000]   Now, don't hear me wrong because nobody grows in faith apart from growing in discipline
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.120]   or engaging in what some have called the means of grace.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:37.760]   No one grows in faith apart from an active engagement in spiritual discipline, so don't
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.720]   hear me wrong.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:45.000]   But the crux of the matter really is that we will grow to be more holy, we will grow
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:54.240]   to be more sanctified as we walk in faith, as our faith grows stronger, as our faith
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.720]   is purified and refined through the course of life.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.000]   Sanctification is a faith issue.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.320]   Jesus said to his disciples, when they were behaving in wrong ways, what did he say?
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.960]   Did he say, "O ye of little discipline?"
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.560]   That's not what he said.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:25.200]   He would address them frequently from the standpoint of, "O ye of little what?
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.740]   Little faith.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:31.200]   You are little faiths," and that was the crux of their problem.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.440]   That's why they were despairing when they came across impossible situations.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.100]   That's why they were anxious for their daily needs.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:48.980]   That's why they experienced this ineffective experience in ministry.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:54.940]   They were powerless in ministry in certain situations because they were little faiths.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.740]   Faith was the issue.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:04.820]   And Jesus even said to them that you're unable to cast out a demon because you have little
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:05.820]   faith.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:10.740]   Jesus said in Matthew 17 verse 20, "For truly I say to you, if you have faith like the grain
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.460]   of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.180]   and nothing will be impossible for you."
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:24.260]   So he's highlighting the central aspect of faith in living for him and doing effective
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.260]   ministry.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:32.980]   And I just want to encourage you tonight as you write this essay to think about the aspect
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.220]   of faith as central to the sanctification process.
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:42.660]   Now again, use the synonyms, believe, to trust.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:47.460]   I think you might be able to see it more clearly if you use those synonyms.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:55.220]   Isn't it true that in every issue of life that we face today, that God is calling us
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.300]   to trust him more?
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:06.300]   God is calling us to grow in our faith, in our reliance, our confidence in him and all
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:11.740]   that he has promised to do for us.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:17.940]   Isn't every issue of life simply an issue that drives us to this question, are you going
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:28.260]   to trust God for your life, for your ministry, for your future, for every issue in your life,
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.260]   or are you going to trust yourself?
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.140]   Are you going to trust someone else?
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.660]   Where is your confidence, your reliance?
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:39.580]   And we grow in our sanctification as our faith grows.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:43.180]   Now disciplines are a means to feed that faith.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.860]   You go to church and you hear God's word, so you can feed that faith.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.700]   You read the Bible every day, so you can feed your faith.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:56.520]   We're not discounting the importance of that, but the issue in sanctification is where is
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.900]   your faith, where have you placed your trust or your reliance?
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:08.700]   Listen to Jeremiah 17 verse five, the classic biblical counseling passage that says, "The
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:13.740]   Lord cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.900]   away from the Lord."
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:24.100]   Now that's a word for this election season, and I have made a commitment.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.780]   My mouth is sealed when it comes to politics.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:34.020]   I'm not going to speak on politics because that's not my role as a pastor, but I will
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:43.960]   say this, if your trust, if your reliance, if your confidence is in any political leader
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.500]   to be your strength or your confidence, then you are placing your trust in man and you
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.780]   are setting yourself up for disappointment.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:01.840]   This is why the day after the election, I'm resolved not to be overly elated nor overly
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:09.740]   disappointed or despairing because my trust is in the Lord, not in any man.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:15.660]   Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:21.020]   Verse seven, "Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust," it's a trust issue,
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.220]   "whose trust is in the Lord.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.200]   He is like a tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream and does not fear
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.540]   when heat comes, for its leaves remain green and is not anxious in the year of drought,
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.420]   for it does not cease to bear fruit."
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.820]   That's the issue of faith, trust, belief.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:44.900]   Faith in the New Testament is used to describe not only a past act of when you came to faith
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:50.720]   in Jesus Christ and received the blessings of justification, but also the ongoing process
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.860]   of walking with God and trusting Him, placing your reliance upon the living God rather than
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:04.380]   on finite man who is here today and gone tomorrow.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.700]   So many passages here, and I'm going to try to wrap this up, but just so many wonderful
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.380]   passages here talking about the central aspect of faith.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.420]   Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5 or 6, "So we are always of good courage.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:22.980]   We know that while we are at home in the body, we're away from the Lord, for we walk by faith,
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.740]   not by sight."
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.660]   That's the present continual reality of our daily walk.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:35.780]   Hebrews 10, verse 37, "For yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:42.140]   delay, but my righteous one shall," here it is, "presently live by faith."
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.540]   Not only talking about faith is the day you came to Jesus Christ, you exercise faith,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.060]   but we live by faith.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.420]   We walk by faith.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:56.380]   We draw near, Hebrews says, in full assurance of faith.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.380]   What is faith?
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:02.440]   Hebrews 11, verse 1, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.440]   not seen."
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.900]   Verse 6, "And without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for whoever would draw near
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.260]   to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him."
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:21.260]   The examples of faith in Hebrews 11, "By faith, Noah, by faith, Abraham, by faith, Sarah,
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:29.180]   by faith, Isaac, by faith, Moses, by faith, Rahab."
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.500]   And then you jump to Hebrews 12, verse 1, "Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.900]   of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin which clings so closely
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:44.060]   and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.300]   and perfecter of our," what?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.300]   Our faith.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:53.680]   I mean, the central role of faith in the sanctification process.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:00.280]   So the practical thing is this, and let me just draw this to a close.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.720]   If all that you give to your counselees, when they come and they're struggling with anger,
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.920]   they're struggling with their purity, or they're struggling with anxiety, or they're struggling
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:17.640]   with resolving conflict, if all that you do is give them, "Well, here's how you should
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.740]   behave and here's how you should not behave."
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.280]   And you never feed their faith.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:32.300]   Where is your trust, where is your reliance, where is your hope placed in?
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:38.740]   If you never feed their faith by taking them to the person and work of Jesus Christ, who
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:46.740]   is the author and perfecter of faith, then the issue would be, can you call that truly
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.040]   biblical counseling?
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.400]   You may use some scriptures, but have you captured the whole theme of scripture, which
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.920]   is to lead us to faith and to strengthen our faith, to strengthen our reliance and our
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.600]   confidence in the living Christ?
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:12.640]   And can I add one final thought on that, is that one of the reasons why God allows us
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:19.800]   to go through seasons of trial and of suffering is to do what?
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:28.000]   Is to purify our faith, is to show us where our faith really is.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.520]   That's 1 Peter 1, verse 6, "In this you rejoice, but now for a little while, if necessary,
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:42.360]   you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.800]   more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to result
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:55.560]   in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.680]   How do we help people grow in faith?
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.240]   We're back to the intellectual aspect.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.760]   We get people into the Word of God.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.080]   We get the Word of God into them.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.840]   We place into people's minds the truths of God's Word.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.480]   There's the emotional aspect.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.480]   We pray.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:18.480]   Can I say to you biblical counselors in training, this is why biblical counseling is, it's more
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.280]   than just dispensing information.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.960]   We labor in prayer on behalf of our counselees, that not only they would understand the scriptures,
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.240]   but that they would be convinced, that they would be convicted, that they would be cut
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240]   to the heart.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   We pray.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.400]   I personally prayed for husbands who are selfish in their marriages and being mean to their
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:44.760]   wives and just labored in prayer, "Lord, God, take the truths of your Word and break this
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:53.160]   person's heart and convict him so that he will live a godly life and love his wife as
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.680]   Christ loved the church."
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:59.680]   It is laboring in prayer that the Word of God would bring conviction upon those whom
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.200]   we minister to.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.160]   And then there is the volitional aspect.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.320]   We use the word "you," the second person "you" a lot in counseling.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.480]   Will you believe this?
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.240]   Will you trust this?
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.280]   Bob or whoever it is that I'm counseling, this is what the Word of God says to you.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:28.840]   Will you trust this Word over against your own opinions or your own thoughts?
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:37.320]   And we call counselees not only to hear and to be convicted, but to respond volitionally,
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:43.040]   to place their trust in Christ and His Word.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:50.440]   This is why biblical counseling offers what no secular model can offer.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.240]   It offers the Word of God, which causes us to grow in faith.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.240]   And as we walk in faith, we are indeed sanctified.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.720]   Okay, friends, I have used up all my time tonight.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.960]   I've gone over time, but I hope that was helpful and had a lot to say and to cover.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.760]   I want to thank you all for joining us on this webinar.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.560]   I hope this was helpful in working through this essay topic.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.800]   Again, hit the main points of defined faith, cover a brief summary of justification by
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:28.400]   faith, and then deal with sanctification, distinguish sanctification from justification,
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.640]   and then talk about the central role of faith in sanctification.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.800]   And then future essays will do more study on sanctification and work through that topic
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   as well.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.680]   So thank you all for joining us tonight.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.440]   I do hope you have a wonderful week.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:50.640]   We're going to be back right at the same time tonight, next Sunday at the five o'clock Pacific
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.200]   time we'll tackle the issue of repentance next week.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.760]   So there's no easy topics in our study of God's Word, but we do hope you'll join us
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.760]   next week.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.600]   Let me pray for us and we'll close our time.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:14.920]   Father, I do pray this for each of my brothers and sisters, each of my friends here tonight.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.480]   Pray this for my own heart and pray this for those whom we minister to, that you would
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:27.680]   help us to grow in faith, that there would be a greater understanding of your Word, a
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   greater conviction of heart and mind as we come under your Word and a greater willingness
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:42.800]   to place our trust in your Word and in Christ rather than ourselves or our opinions or what
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.160]   other men might say.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.240]   Pray that as we grow in faith.
