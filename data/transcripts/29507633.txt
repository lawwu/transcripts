[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.040]   Welcome, friends, to this episode
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.580]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.940]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.360]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.340]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.720]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.960]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.120]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.220]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.140]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.980]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.980]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.420]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.180]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.800]   Well, listeners, I'm so excited to be with you today.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.480]   As we begin the second semester,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   as we're all kinda getting back into our routines, we hope,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.800]   after the long Christmas break,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.920]   I was thinking the other day,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.920]   so many of us fully believe that big goals
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.360]   or big dreams have to involve big plans
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   and big changes and big steps.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.620]   Somehow, we have bought into the thinking
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.620]   that being successful involves changing our whole mindset
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.460]   or shifting our whole way of living
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.640]   and that it has to be really hard
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.440]   and that there are all these steps that you have to follow.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.800]   Well, I am here to tell you that that kind of thinking
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.140]   can discourage us before we even get started,
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.400]   especially in the gray days of January
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   or really, y'all, any time that we have gotten off track.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   So today, I want to explore a different way of thinking.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.560]   I want us to consider the power of small habits
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.000]   on our roads to success.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480]   I have one of my bestest friends,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.280]   one of my best classical educator friends with me today,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.720]   and we are gonna be really honest right in front of you
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.260]   and talk about the power of small habits.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.860]   Kelly Wilt, I am so glad
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.000]   that you agreed to be with me today.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460]   - Oh, absolutely, Lisa.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.480]   This is a topic that, as our homeschooling journey
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680]   has unfolded, has grown nearer and dearer to my heart.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.400]   So I am so excited to talk about this today with you.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.380]   - And I'm excited to explore with you
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.500]   the ways that I have changed.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   I tended to be a real, and I still am.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.520]   Let's be real about this.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.940]   I still am a very type A, driven, make a list,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.480]   set a priority, and have interim goals and all these steps.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.460]   That is who I am naturally in my personality,
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.240]   and the Holy Spirit is helping me
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   to recover from the worst of that and keep the best of that.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.960]   But it has been a journey for me, like you alluded to.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.220]   All the years of homeschooling,
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.220]   the Lord has used to sand off a lot of my rough edges.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.540]   I'm sure I have plenty left,
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.480]   but I am learning a lot about the power of small habits.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.180]   So let me start, I wanna ask you,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.000]   just kinda set the tone and let some of my online friends
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.540]   get to know my in-person friend.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.800]   What are some of the big goals
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.600]   that you have set in your life?
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.980]   And you can go as far back as you want to,
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.460]   or as recent as you are comfortable with.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.320]   What are some of the big goals you've set in your life?
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.160]   - Well, let me first, before I answer this question,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.600]   say that you and I are cut from the same kinda cloth.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.440]   - I know.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.100]   - That I am a reforming type A.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.740]   I used to say that I was a type A plus.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.160]   How terrible is that?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.000]   - I know, right?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.560]   It fits your personality though.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.060]   - Yes, but I think I was born setting goals for myself.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.060]   The one that comes to mind that I can distinctly recall
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.880]   was probably the first time in my life
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.840]   that I set a goal and took steps to achieve it
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.020]   was when I was in high school my freshman year,
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.400]   and I discovered what a valedictorian was.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.860]   I was an academic to the core,
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.800]   and I delighted in learning.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.780]   I loved learning.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.900]   I've always loved learning.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.200]   But when I found out that the valedictorian
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.920]   of our senior class would get to stand and give a speech,
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.340]   and wear a medal, and that that honor would be bestowed
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.940]   on the student who had the highest
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.580]   numeric grade point average,
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.420]   oh, I wanted so desperately for that to be me.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.140]   And so, it's humorous when I look back on it.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.440]   At that time, it was very serious.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.000]   But in high school, in my class,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.460]   I had two very dear friends,
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.180]   and the three of us were neck and neck.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.320]   That was our goal.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.220]   And it was a good thing for the three of us
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.740]   because we kept it from being a bad thing.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.360]   We would encourage each other on.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.660]   I successfully learned how to calculate a GPA.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.260]   (laughing)
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.860]   - We're timely, no doubt.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.260]   - Yes, so that's a skill that,
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.860]   as we're now graduating our children from homeschool,
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.780]   has come in handy.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.580]   But it was a goal that I remember I would,
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.500]   I worked hard, Lisa.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.780]   I mean, I kept that goal in mind,
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.700]   and praise the Lord to His glory, and not to my own.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.980]   That was an honor that I achieved
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.460]   when I graduated from high school.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.300]   And I still have the medal from that.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.380]   And at that time, I thought,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.140]   "Oh, I'm going to cherish this forever."
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.820]   Well, let me just tell you,
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.420]   it's been sitting in a box in my parents' house
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.740]   for the past, I won't say how many years,
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.740]   but the ability to set goals
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.020]   and build habits to achieve those goals
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.660]   is something I still keep with me now,
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.300]   which is infinitely more valuable
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.760]   than that sad little medal.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.680]   Absolutely, and I love that.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.600]   There are valuable lessons that you learn
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.120]   when you set big goals.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.280]   But let me ask you this.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   How did you achieve this goal?
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.080]   I mean, were they all, you made a plan,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.800]   I'm sure, knowing you.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.160]   I know that you had a plan
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.760]   Were the plans very detailed?
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.720]   Were they big?
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   How often did you change them or alter them?
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.280]   Well, because my goal was academic,
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.980]   I knew that I needed to study.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.880]   And so I needed to give myself accountability
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.000]   to study well and perform as well as I could
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.240]   on the quizzes and tests
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.400]   so that I would have a higher average.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   But I soon realized that it wasn't merely the performance
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   and the numeric grade that would help me
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.240]   to reach my end goal.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.080]   I needed to have better study habits.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.800]   I needed to prioritize different things in my life.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.600]   And I will admit to you, at the end of my freshman year,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.960]   I felt very overwhelmed.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.320]   Partially because I knew I would have to work hard
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.200]   for three more years.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.880]   And then I would have to continue to be consistent.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.400]   But I felt overwhelmed because at first,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.040]   I did not break this goal down into small, manageable steps.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.480]   It was simply do better.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.280]   And that thought was not helpful to me.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.320]   That was the goal I wanted to reach.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.340]   I wanted to do better.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.240]   But I really had to spend time thinking about
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.020]   what were the habits that I needed to build
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.720]   in order to be that valedictorian?
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.040]   What were the steps, the manageable small steps
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.180]   that I needed to take in order to reach that end goal?
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.560]   And when my focus changed from do better
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.760]   to what is the next thing that I need to do?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.940]   What is the next thing that I need to be consistent
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.040]   and disciplined about maintaining?
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.160]   Then suddenly that goal seemed doable
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.400]   and not quite so daunting because I could take action.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.640]   And I think that was a major key for me
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.040]   in being successful.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.800]   The change in my mindset really helped me
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.680]   to make that goal attainable.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   - That is awesome.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.520]   That is awesome.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.240]   Okay, so listeners, what I hope that you wrote down
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.360]   in your mind, if not on a piece of paper,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   from what Kelly said, is that it's not just the big
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.600]   general goals of do better and study harder
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.780]   and finish more assignments.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.780]   It's the specific measurable goals that lead you
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.900]   to be consistent and persistent and to take action.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.640]   That's really good.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.840]   Let me ask you this, Kelly.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   Do you feel like you are generally a productive person?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.200]   - I think so.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.080]   When I think about the word productive,
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.880]   I think that there's another P word
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.440]   that is associated with that and that's progress.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.520]   And if you're productive, you should feel like
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.680]   you're moving forward in the most positive of ways
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.880]   to near a goal, to accomplish a goal.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.320]   And I think over time, though, productivity
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.120]   has looked different in our homeschooling years
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.840]   based on the ages of our children.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.680]   When my children were small, I would take out a notepad
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.720]   each day and I would write down three main things
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   that I wanted to accomplish.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.160]   And if I did those three things, that was a productive day.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.140]   As my children have gotten older and more independent,
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.640]   my definition of productivity has changed
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.880]   because of how much I'm able to accomplish
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.520]   over the course of the day as that independence
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.960]   has grown in my children
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.160]   and I've transferred that over to them.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.840]   So if you're a listener who has really small children,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.120]   you may look at what you're able to accomplish and think,
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.760]   oh, I don't do that much.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.240]   Well, there's a lot of invisible tasks that right now
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.400]   you are investing your time and energy into
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.160]   that is productive, that is creating progress,
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.620]   but you might not see the end result right now,
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.920]   but you are helping to create habits even in your children
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.640]   that will down the line help you to feel
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.840]   that you're being more productive as an individual
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.200]   and that truly your family is more productive
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.560]   because of the training and the skills
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.120]   that you were investing that time into when they were young.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.280]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.160]   It is so easy for us to say at the end of the day,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.400]   we did half a math lesson.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.480]   We read one story together
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.180]   and they each probably did 30 minutes of reading
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.720]   and we went through the memory work one time.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.540]   This was not a productive day and you're right.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.520]   I had days like that when my girls were young
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.300]   and I would have to force myself to look back and think,
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:32.260]   but we also baked muffins
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.720]   for the invalid neighbor next door.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.920]   I taught my children to set the table correctly
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.000]   and they brought down their dirty laundry
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.120]   and carried their basket up.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.040]   We memorized another verse of scripture together
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.640]   this morning.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   We played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego with Daddy
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.720]   and we learned some more places in the world.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   There are small habits that we are inculcating
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.800]   in our children every day that are part
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.480]   of progress and part of our goals
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.600]   and part of being productive.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   Here's another truth.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.760]   I was gonna ask you, are you always productive?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.240]   You productive woman, you are.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   You always productive in all of your areas at the same time
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.400]   or do you have to take turns being productive in your work
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.280]   or in your tutoring or in your homemaking
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.680]   or in your Bible study?
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.140]   - Yeah, I mean, productivity is intensely personal
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.140]   because there will be different areas of your life
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.400]   that demand immediate attention at different points.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.200]   And are we really being productive if we ignore the things
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.760]   that truly are the most important?
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.720]   I could be in the midst of doing a deep dive declutter
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.740]   of my kitchen, but one of my children runs into the room
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.920]   and says, "Oh my goodness, I just cut my hand open
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.760]   on a piece of glass."
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.640]   Well, you better believe my priorities are going
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.840]   to immediately be rescheduled because there is productivity
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   but with productivity, there also is prioritization.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.800]   So sometimes we can set out to have a day filled
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.340]   with the best of intentions, but life does happen.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.340]   And we have to be willing to, as a good friend of mine says,
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.680]   hold the marbles that represent our day very loosely
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.080]   in our hands and to not determine our success or failure
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.340]   based on which marbles are still in our hands
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.000]   by the end of the day, because we have to be able
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   to reprioritize based on need.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.960]   I do believe though, that if we're thinking
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.520]   about a long-term goal, as opposed to the goals
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.500]   over the course of a day, that those habits
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.920]   that we intentionally build over the course of one day,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.000]   spill over into the next day, and then the next week
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   and the next month, and before long, in true habitual form,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.200]   we don't even have to think about them,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.280]   they become a part of who we are.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.940]   And they can radically transform who we are as people,
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.200]   they can transform who we are as homeschoolers,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.120]   they can help us to transform our children even
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.880]   and how they prioritize and how they think
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.200]   and how they plan and grow.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.120]   So I think there's daily productivity,
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.880]   but also there is that intentional act
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.200]   of establishing those habits and building them one
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.800]   on top of the other, almost like building blocks,
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.240]   so that we can build that habit
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.100]   that becomes a part of who we are.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.600]   Just like the five core habits that we promote
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   in classical conversations, we want to practice them
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.520]   with intentionality to the point that they become a part
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.440]   of who we are.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.680]   I may have to consciously think about naming things
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.080]   or attending to things or, oh, I need to memorize this.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.600]   But after doing that for so long, eventually,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.720]   I look at those now and I think, oh, I do that,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.640]   I really do that, but I don't have the conscious decision
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.360]   any longer because those habits are a part
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.400]   of who I am as a homeschooler, which is the same thing.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.640]   If we want to establish productivity,
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.160]   it's building those little habits so that eventually
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.640]   that productive person that we want to be is who we are
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.900]   without even having to really think or plan.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.520]   And that's so much better than the wearying thought
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.720]   of having to consciously make every single choice
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.640]   to help us to accomplish a goal, right?
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   I have a friend that I have homeschooled with
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.300]   for a long time, her kids are younger than mine,
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.780]   but we've known each other for years and years.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:23.160]   And she has a really great perspective
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.620]   on trying to be successful.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.440]   And it's really hard, let's just be honest,
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.860]   you and I have talked about this before,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.720]   that coming back in January is hard for a lot of us
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.620]   as families because we look back and we can look back
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.660]   at the fall and think, oh, this went really well
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.680]   and some of these things did not go as well.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.320]   But we're starting fresh and we're starting over
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.680]   and you think, well, I have the opportunity
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.120]   to really do great things.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.080]   And sometimes you spend all these great plans in your head,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.380]   but then the reality is that, man, we all got used
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.380]   to sleeping in and having snacks whenever we wanted to
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.660]   and not really having to do things
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.060]   that were not our favorite things.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.260]   And now it's time to get back to the grindstone
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.780]   and oh my goodness, we have community next week
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.660]   and I have this many lessons to read
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.620]   or I've got to finish this book
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.040]   and somebody's gonna ask me about my science project.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.400]   And there are all of these things
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   and we can get really discouraged before we even begin.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:42.360]   And so my friend said, I know that establishing a routine
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:51.960]   is what leads to productivity and productivity leads
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.560]   to success in whatever you are trying to achieve.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.960]   Now my friend is a self-proclaimed loosey-goosey.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   Her mom, she says that she, and she learned this lesson
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.320]   about establishing a routine, she says the hard way
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.920]   because she did love the loosey-goosey life
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.000]   where you just follow your child's interest
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   and you just do, you wake up every morning
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.280]   and see what grabs you or see what seems good
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.280]   and you just let that kind of take you.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.040]   The tide takes you where it will.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.440]   But she said, she discovered that that was not her friend
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.480]   and it was not actually the friend of her children.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   It's very difficult for your children's temperament
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.200]   sometimes to have no routine because I have discovered
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.580]   through years and years of working with my own kids
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.920]   but with a lot of other kids too,
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.060]   that children by and large actually thrive
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.640]   with some measure of predictability.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.560]   They actually like, there is comfort for those small people
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.480]   in knowing that these same kinds of things
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.480]   are going to happen every day in pretty much the same order
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.000]   with basically the same people and these kinds of things
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.440]   will always be expected of me and these kinds of things
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   will never be expected of me.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.840]   And there is comfort in those boundaries.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.460]   And so I found that to be true with my own children
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.220]   but my friend said, so when we came back
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.220]   from the long break at Christmas, I woke up and thought,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.320]   oh no, this is gonna go, I don't know,
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.500]   this is not gonna go well.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.420]   I feel like this is gonna be really hard.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.580]   We're so out of our routine.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.460]   And then she realized, no, we know what to do
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:00.460]   when we get up on a school week and on a school day
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.240]   and we are just, it is so rote,
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.180]   our routine is so well established.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.920]   It's a habit that we do without thinking about it.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   And she said, she realized that because everybody knew
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.760]   what to do and when to do it and they were just kind of
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.480]   on autopilot even when they weren't feeling it,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.880]   they were doing it and that that was going to result
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.360]   at the end of the day in a productive day
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.880]   and a whole string of those productive days
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.760]   were gonna add up to success.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.280]   And she said, that was so reassuring.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.040]   And I'm here to tell you that that is really the truth.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   One thing I've learned is that big detailed plans
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.960]   as much as I love them, Kelly, I do love me
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   to make me some plans, but those big detailed plans
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.600]   don't have the power that small routines do.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.400]   And sometimes my lofty goals and my big picture plans
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.640]   can just make me tired and they can get too complicated
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.000]   to be managed when I'm overwhelmed or when we are out
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.980]   of our regular routine.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.380]   Why is that so true?
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.680]   Oh, because life happens, doesn't it?
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   And regardless of what plans we have ahead of time,
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.260]   like I said, we have to, especially as homeschool parents,
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.480]   be prepared to reprioritize based on a moment.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.800]   But we also have to know how to reserve our best yes
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   for those things that would contribute to that end goal.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.760]   If my goal is that all of my children do A, B, C
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.240]   over the course of the homeschooling day
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.220]   and a friend calls me up and says, it's beautiful outside,
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.680]   let's go to the park.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.520]   Well, you know what?
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.360]   If I have established routines, our family may be in a place
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.840]   where on that day, I can say, yes, we can take time away.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.560]   It will not detract from our goal because we are stepping
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.880]   out of the routine.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   But you also have to be able to, on the flip side,
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.120]   look at what your children have accomplished and go,
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.680]   you know what, maybe that is not the best yes for today.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.560]   - Yes, good, that is really good.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.840]   - That is the thing about routines,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.200]   I think that it is so beneficial.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.040]   Because when we make big goals and we don't establish
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.200]   the habits to build the routines, then the first time
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.280]   we hit a roadblock, we're derailed.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.100]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.440]   - And we might as well throw in the towel and say,
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.000]   oh, woe is me, I can never accomplish anything.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.760]   And that's just not so.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.360]   But when we build small habits, one on top of the next,
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.460]   then if we have something that happens that derails us,
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.440]   well, we pick up again, and we continue to work that habit
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.140]   until it's established and then build.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.540]   Kind of like, I guess if I'm thinking about Legos,
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.720]   when my children were young, they would build
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.100]   these huge Lego towers.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.960]   And then one of my sons who will remain nameless
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.980]   was the more mischievously inclined, he would come
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.860]   and he would take one Lego out of this huge tower.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.360]   And then the whole tower would tumble down.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.080]   And his brother would say, oh no, my whole tower is gone.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.200]   And I would say, well, let's build it back up.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.680]   And he would sit there for a few minutes
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.440]   and bemoan his tower.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.740]   But then he would start to rebuild it again.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.860]   And somehow as adults, I think this kind of thinking
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.840]   doesn't transfer to us.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.760]   - Isn't that funny, you're right.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.460]   - We just bemoan the whole plan and think,
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.260]   oh, I can never do this thing.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.640]   No, we have to take a lesson from our kids.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.360]   - Yeah, we tend to throw out the whole plan
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.620]   and make a new one instead of saying,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.220]   that's just a momentary blip, okay?
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.960]   So I still want the same plan, but I took a time out.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.540]   And so I just need to get right back on it.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.320]   I need to get right back to the plan.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   I love what you said about serendipity,
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.440]   those serendipity moments.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   Just because you have built habits and routines
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.520]   in for your family does not make you
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.460]   a lifelong stick in the mud.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.080]   It does not mean that you will never say yes
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.080]   to suddenly offered fun, that you will never
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.600]   chase the rabbit, that you will never throw out
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   the course guide for the fun activity hands-on.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.680]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.920]   Actually, when you have established routines,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.820]   like you were saying, and you've established good habits,
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.220]   then you can say yes to the silly,
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.020]   or yes to the unexpected more easily,
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.220]   because you know that a momentary derailment
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.340]   is not permanent.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.400]   You have not plunged over the cliff.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.820]   You just jumped the track for a minute
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.140]   and you're gonna get back on.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.780]   - That's right. - I love that.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.140]   - Yes, do not sacrifice the fun and the spontaneous,
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.840]   but the routines are what allows that to happen
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.780]   without you feeling as if your whole habit tower
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.900]   is completely destroyed and you'll never be able
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.280]   to rebuild back to the goal that you want to achieve.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.320]   Yes, keep the fun. (laughs)
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.360]   - Yes, and you can keep it without feeling guilty,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.840]   which y'all, let's face it, if you're gonna do
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.880]   the serendipity thing but feel guilty the whole time,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.300]   it just ruins it. - Yes.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.160]   - You don't enjoy it, and frankly,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.240]   you can be a wet blanket for your kids.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.720]   Let's just don't, and say we did, okay?
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.280]   So let's talk about it.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.000]   All right, I wanna be a little bit particular.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.820]   I wanna say, what are some of these habits
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.520]   that you have uncovered over the years
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.600]   that propel your family to success?
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   What are some of the habits that have led to routines
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.960]   that have become so automatic
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   that they are bearing you on the tide of success?
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.720]   - This is such a great question,
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   and I'm ashamed that it took me so long
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.480]   to figure some of these out. (laughs)
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.200]   But I will cheer them in hopes that they will help
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.360]   someone else who's not quite so far along
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.280]   on the journey. - There you go, excellent.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.400]   - For me as a homeschooler, I don't think I was clued
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.520]   into the fact that my environment was so crucial
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.880]   in shaping my ability as a homeschooler
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   to focus in on my children and what we were doing together.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.160]   My environment needs to be in a place
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.520]   where I'm not in the back of my mind thinking,
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.920]   oh, what are we having for supper?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.080]   Oh, there are all these things everywhere.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   And so for me, just because our home is our classroom,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.640]   just like the rest of the world is our classroom,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.080]   but a lot of our deep thinking occurs in that environment.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.520]   Now, does it bother my children
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.280]   that there's a stack of dishes in the sink?
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.400]   Absolutely not, because they're from my children.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.480]   But for me as a mom, when I'm sitting there
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.420]   and we're trying to solve algebra problems
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.720]   at the kitchen table, and I look over
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.740]   and I see all the to-do's that need to be to-done,
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.600]   I discovered that I needed to establish routines
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.340]   for our family that would contribute to me
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.820]   having the mental space to completely focus.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.300]   And so I have, over the course of these last 20 years,
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.220]   created habits that helped me to have simple things,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.940]   like an empty sink, or a swept floor
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.900]   where there are not mounds of crumbs
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.480]   that our little dog is lapping up all the time,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.660]   or laundry under control.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.140]   I won't say always done, because that would not be true.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.980]   - Right, that's crazy, until your children
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.940]   don't live with you, that will not be true.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.100]   - There will always be laundry, but laundry under,
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.660]   you know, laundry with a plan, things like that.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.120]   And I think those in-home routines
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.380]   have also helped my children to have structure
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.380]   so that they know on certain days
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.220]   their laundry will be done, and that they can come get it,
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.580]   and they can fold it, because they're of that age now
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.920]   where they are consistently helping out.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.020]   You know, knowing that I need to run
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.820]   the dishwasher at night, and then empty it
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.220]   first thing in the morning is a very practical thing,
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.160]   but it gives us a place to put our dirty dishes
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.180]   when we break from homeschooling for lunch,
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.500]   or we're having that afternoon snack.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.020]   - I love that.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.860]   - Those little habits that we've accumulated over time,
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.320]   because in true type A+ fashion, I thought that,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.780]   oh, I'm just gonna do all the things,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.920]   and be, quote unquote, be better.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.340]   Well, that didn't happen, Lisa.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.420]   That was a big, that was a recipe for crash and burn.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.300]   - And you know what?
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.020]   Be better means something different
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.660]   to everybody in your family.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.500]   - Yes, for sure.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.020]   - And if homeschooling is a joint endeavor,
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.900]   then we need to define our terms.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.260]   What does be better mean?
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.420]   - Exactly.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.380]   - And just because, I mean, you're right.
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.660]   It does not bother, it never bothered my children
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.460]   that there were crumbs under the table
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.380]   that we were doing our reading on, but it bothered me,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.840]   and so we just, that needed to become a defined thing,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.200]   that we do, there are certain basic chores we do first,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.740]   so that, like you said, our environment is hospitable
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.280]   for all of us, not just for some of us.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.940]   - Right, well, and I will say,
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.120]   as far as homeschooling itself is concerned,
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.200]   I think some of the habits
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.560]   that we've tried to establish as a family,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.200]   one of them we lovingly refer to
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.320]   as eating our frogs before breakfast.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.600]   - How funny.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.560]   - So we look at, my children look at what they need
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.080]   to accomplish, and they take care of the task
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.820]   that they look at with dread and disdain first,
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.560]   and just like productivity is personal,
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.540]   that choice is personal too, and for each of my children,
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:33.020]   that is a different frog that they take care of,
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.300]   but just knowing that they've accomplished that,
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.260]   that is the building block, they eat breakfast,
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.860]   and then it's time for the frog,
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.840]   and then after that, it becomes almost
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.120]   like a snowball effect.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.080]   The day becomes increasingly easier
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.960]   because the guard is taking care of the difficult thing,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   so that's been incredibly helpful to them as students
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.960]   to know that, you know what,
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.240]   I'm gonna invest my energy, and I'm gonna get this done,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.360]   and throughout our years as a homeschooling family,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.600]   that has looked different based on the ages of my children,
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.160]   because we've been through seasons
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.000]   where I have one or two children napping
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.580]   while another child does school,
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.260]   or we've had different iterations
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.320]   of what our most productive day looked like,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.680]   and as a parent, you need to take time
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.600]   to look at your family,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.720]   what are your family's rhythms of the day,
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.800]   and think about, okay, you know what,
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.840]   I want to accomplish these tasks,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.040]   when is the best time, and choosing that best time
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.980]   can help you in building that routine,
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.300]   because if you're trying to kick against the bricks,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.140]   and you're trying to get something
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.420]   that takes a lot of mental energy done
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.580]   at the time when, oh my goodness,
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.220]   we used to jokingly refer to it as the witching hour,
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.140]   at our house, whenever it was almost supper time,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.900]   and everyone was hungry,
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.660]   and slightly disgruntled when they were young.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:02.660]   If I had tried to do deep thinking work at that time,
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.040]   I would have been defeating myself before I even began.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.540]   So sometimes taking that extra time
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.200]   to consider the rhythm of your day,
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.960]   and your family members, and the rhythms of their day,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.520]   can help you to be able to know when to build the habits,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.160]   and not just what habits to build.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.680]   - Yeah, I think that's really smart.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   I think that the power of routine
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.640]   is that you do it automatically,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.640]   even if you're tired, even if somebody is sick or missing,
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   even if you don't want to,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.440]   or even if you haven't done it in a long time.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.120]   And so when we start back to school in January,
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.920]   or in second semester, if there are things that we know,
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.400]   we just have a routine, we have a rhythm.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.920]   Everybody gets up, like you said, we all get up,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.200]   and it may be different, listeners, at your house.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.860]   The order may be different,
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.400]   but you need to establish some routines
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.360]   that your children can follow
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.800]   without a lot of redirection,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.480]   without a lot of negotiation.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.760]   There are things that just aren't.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.040]   We all get up.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.440]   For my kids, it's we get up,
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.160]   and we immediately make our bed.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.140]   Don't come down until you make your bed,
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.040]   because I know how it works.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.160]   If you go back upstairs to find something,
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.480]   you might crawl back in that bed, so let's not.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.320]   So we get up, we make our bed, we eat our breakfast,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.680]   we do the frog, and then maybe your children know
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.280]   it's time to read together,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   or every morning they know that they're gonna do math first,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.240]   they're gonna have devotion, then they're gonna do math,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.160]   and then we're gonna have a read time.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.940]   And so everybody does the hard thing,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.960]   if math is your hard thing, they do that hard thing first
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.060]   so that they get to the easy thing,
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.140]   or the snuggly thing, or the together thing.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.000]   Develop routines.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.440]   I think it's really important.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.120]   One of your routines might be that everybody's
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   school supplies are in a certain box or a certain bin,
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.360]   and everybody goes to get their own bin every day.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.280]   My kids, our house was really small
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.320]   when the girls were young, and we homeschooled
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.200]   at the breakfast room, well, it was the breakfast room
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.820]   and the dining room table, it was the only table we had,
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.460]   and it was that we had a bookshelf,
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.460]   and they each had a little tote that had their pencils
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.800]   and their rulers and their glue stick and their markers
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.920]   and their bookmarks and whatever they needed in there,
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.760]   and they had a board that they put down
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.240]   so that when they bore down really hard with their pencil,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.300]   they did not etch their math problems
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.960]   into my dining room table, which did not always happen,
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.280]   but now, as a mom with grown children,
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.680]   I like the fact that I can still read
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.100]   the five times five is 25 at my table.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.360]   But anyway, they knew to get their boxes,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.600]   and they knew when we're done with school, you put it back.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.040]   So routines like that mean
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.360]   that you're not spending 30 minutes,
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.060]   everybody looking for their pencil,
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.120]   or 15 minutes looking for the Bob book
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.960]   that you threw under the couch in December,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.980]   and now you don't know where it is.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.580]   So all of those kinds of things.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:50.840]   If you decide on, I had one friend who had 10 children.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   She homeschooled all 10 of her children.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.720]   They're a wonderful family.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.400]   But she went through a season when she had lots of littles,
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.960]   and getting them dressed in the morning was a nightmare,
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.420]   and deciding who was gonna wear what,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.140]   and oh, you have my shirt, no, that's my shirt,
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.880]   and this doesn't match and that doesn't match.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.260]   And she instituted, she bought pullover jumpers
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.280]   for the girls and jeans for the boys,
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.800]   and they had like three shirts a piece,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.440]   and they got up and there was no question.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   You put on this shirt, you put on this jumper,
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.560]   and that's what you're wearing.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.800]   And they all wore the same thing
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.480]   because she needed to get through that part of the day
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.020]   to get to the routine that was gonna bring them success.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.200]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.880]   Well, and you know, Lisa, the funny thing is,
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   now that we're, oh goodness, my eldest is 20.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.540]   So if I say that our first homeschooling days
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.280]   began when he was born,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.040]   you know, there are some routines and habits
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.260]   that we established at certain points in our life
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.880]   that turned our day almost into a dance,
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.160]   where you just danced from one thing to the next,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.920]   and now I reflect on those routines,
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.560]   and there's so much joy,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.880]   I almost don't want to stop the routine.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.360]   I have, we had a similar situation with our children's
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.620]   school supplies when they were young.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.120]   We were all around one little table in an apartment,
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.500]   and so to corral all the school supplies,
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.400]   I saved tin cans and wrapped them in masking tape,
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.100]   in duct tape, and then put them in a shower caddy.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.880]   And so I still have this shower caddy
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.960]   with our little tin cans that have our dry erase markers
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.660]   and our colored pencils, and do my two students
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.200]   who are now in high school still need that?
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.480]   No, but it was such an endearing part
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.360]   of our family's homeschooling routine
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.000]   to have that sitting on the table.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.520]   They knew homeschool was beginning for the day
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.560]   when I put that caddy on the table.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.220]   I simply cannot bring myself to let it go quite yet,
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.640]   because those routines were endearing,
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.760]   and they were a sign that homeschool was in session,
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.000]   and we were beginning our studies.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And there is a joy and a peacefulness
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.400]   that will pervade your household
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.300]   when you find that sweet spot for those habits and routines.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.600]   - That is the most encouraging thing,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.720]   potentially, that you have said.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   And that is the perfect place for us to end.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.660]   Here's the truth, establishing some routines
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.040]   will lead you to productivity
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.080]   that you don't have to belabor every day,
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.200]   and will eventually bring you success.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.000]   But what those kinds of routines will bring your homeschool
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.040]   and your family is peace.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.000]   And isn't that what we all want a little bit more of
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.520]   in this thing here? - Absolutely.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.060]   Absolutely. - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.300]   Well, parents, this has been a great time of encouragement,
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.300]   I hope, along with some fresh practical ideas for you.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.640]   I have one more thing I wanna tell you about
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.280]   that might also be a new idea for you,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.760]   but could possibly prove to be the best thing
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.400]   you ever did for yourself.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.060]   If you are looking to level up your skills
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.960]   in guiding and assessing your students' learning at home,
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.780]   I wanna talk to you about the classical learning cohort.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.940]   The spring semester is just getting started.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.720]   Six times throughout this semester,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   you can meet online with a small group
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.300]   of other homeschool parents who are on this same mission
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.480]   to grow their understanding about classical education
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   and develop lifelong skills for guiding their students
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.620]   through the truth of learning.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:05.080]   Your cohort would be led by an experienced mentor
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.840]   who will walk you all through
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.200]   some hands-on practical assignments,
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.640]   helping you learn how to give good classical assessments,
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.900]   helping you to grab your students' attention,
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.080]   giving them an exhortium into what you're getting ready
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.200]   to study together, and then developing a review
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.640]   that'll help you engage your student with every lesson.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.500]   If you wanna keep growing in your knowledge
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.040]   and as your skills too, as a classical educator,
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.580]   the learning cohort might really be for you.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.540]   So spaces are limited and I don't want you guys to miss out,
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:51.540]   so don't wait, go to classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.280]   You can find out more information and you can sign up.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   That's classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:10.180]   Okay, you guys, go and establish a routine
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.800]   that will make you truly productive
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.380]   and find peace in your home.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.520]   And I'll see you next time, bye.
