[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.360]   the Gospel according to St. John in the fifth chapter and the last three verses, verses
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:25.320]   45, 46 and 47 in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.240]   Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuseth you, even
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.920]   Moses in whom ye trust.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.120]   For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.640]   But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:07.200]   In those most solemn words, our blessed Lord and Saviour brings to a close this series
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   of extraordinary and remarkable things that he has been saying to these Jews whom he met
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.320]   when he was up at Jerusalem and who were offended with him because he had healed a man on the
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.720]   Sabbath day.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.600]   This mighty discourse begins at the seventeenth verse and goes right on like this until the
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.680]   end of the chapter.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   Those who attend here with any kind of regularity will know that we have been considering this
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:56.040]   wonderful and amazing chapter most Sunday evenings since the second Sunday evening last
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.240]   January.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.720]   We have done so, of course, because of the richness of the teaching that is found here.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.400]   But here our Lord brings this mighty discourse to an end.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.320]   And he does so, as we see from the words that I have just read to you, in a most solemn
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.400]   and alarming manner.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.040]   He leaves them with a word of warning.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.920]   Now there was nothing else that he could do.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.880]   There was nothing else to say.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.160]   He had gone out of his way in order to make the truth plain and clear to them.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.760]   He has told them specifically that he is speaking to them at all in order that they might be
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   saved.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.800]   He is concerned about them.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.880]   He is anxious that they should be reconciled to God and that their sins should be forgiven.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.520]   And that is why, in spite of their charging him with blasphemy, in spite of their charging
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.000]   him with being a lawbreaker, he still persists in speaking to them.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.960]   And he has put the truth very plainly.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   He has made explicit statements with regard to himself and who he is.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.840]   He has not hesitated to claim that he is equal with God the Father and that the Father has
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.760]   given him the power to give life and even the power of judgment.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.600]   Nothing could be plainer.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.840]   He has said to them in those wonderful words, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.120]   heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.160]   come into condemnation, but is already passed from death unto life."
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.920]   He is offering life to them, and yet they persist in refusing him.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.600]   And then, in order to help them, he has shown them how utterly wrong they are.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.640]   As Jews, especially, we are familiar with the Scriptures.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.560]   And as I have kept on reminding you, he produces his wonderful evidence, the evidence, the
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.520]   testimony of John the Baptist, the testimony of miracles, the testimony of God's own
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   voice heard from heaven, the testimony of all the Old Testament Scriptures.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:33.000]   There it is, all pointing to him, stating who he is and why he has come.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.560]   And still they persist in their unbelief.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.960]   And here, he is at the very end, as we have been seeing, been analyzing their position
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.920]   to them, as if to say, "Now, can't I show you your position?
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.520]   You don't want to come unto me.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.960]   You will not come unto me that you might have life, and you won't because of the state
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.320]   of your hearts.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.720]   You talk about God, but you haven't got the love of God in your hearts.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.840]   You think that I am anxious that you should believe in me because I want you to honor
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   me.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   I don't want your honor.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.000]   I receive not honor from men.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.360]   But you know," he said, "your trouble is that you live to be honored by one another,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.120]   and that's why you don't believe in me.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.720]   How can you believe which receive honor one of another?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.960]   And seek not the honor that cometh from God only."
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.600]   Oh, never had a people a greater opportunity of seeing and receiving the truth than these
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   people.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   Here is the very Son of God putting it to them in different forms and ways, pleading
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.200]   with them, appealing to them, and on and on he goes, but still they stand back, refusing
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.040]   him in their unbelief.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:02.560]   So now I say there is nothing left for him to do but to warn them.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.720]   It is something that he did repeatedly in his ministry.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.880]   Now I know that people don't like words of warning.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.560]   There is some natural dislike in the human heart of words of warning, and yet it is very
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.480]   foolish, isn't it?
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.800]   People say, "Oh, tell us about the love of God," but don't warn us, don't threaten
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   us.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.760]   But my dear friend, if you don't listen to the positive statements, the love of God
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.480]   is so great that he would warn you in order that you might see your position.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.080]   Warning is ever a manifestation of love.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   I have often used the illustration in this pulpit.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.720]   You don't blame a doctor who brings pressure to bear upon you to have an operation if he
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   knows that that operation alone can save your life.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.400]   You wouldn't resent it.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.520]   You wouldn't regard him as an unkind or a cruel person.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.240]   You would be grateful to him.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.960]   He sees the position.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   You don't.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.080]   He has told you that he advises an operation, but still you don't see it.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.760]   You say, "Oh, it's unnecessary.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.160]   He's an alarmist."
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.800]   Well then, he begins to bring pressure to bear.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   He warns you.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.720]   He says, "Now if you don't, this is what's going to happen to you."
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.320]   We don't like to hear things like that, and yet we know that he's doing it for our
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   good.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.280]   Well now, it's exactly the same with the gospel.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.320]   When our Lord warns these people, I argue that it is still a manifestation of his loving
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.840]   concern about them.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.720]   He now, I say, having put it positively, puts it negatively.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:45.760]   If you don't believe, he says, "Well, that and that alone awaits you."
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.800]   And so he puts it quite plainly to them.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.160]   What he really says is this, isn't it?
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:04.760]   That there is nothing that awaits those who finally do not believe in him but condemnation,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.160]   accusation.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:15.120]   "Think not that I will accuse you, but there is one that accuseth you."
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.440]   Accusation and condemnation.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.520]   He shows them the inevitability of it, and he at the same time shows them the way in
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.080]   which this accusation and condemnation will be brought to pass.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.800]   And as I say, his only reason for doing this is that he would have them see the perilous
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.720]   position in which they are.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.280]   They didn't realize that.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.240]   Our Lord is trying to get these people to see that if they don't believe in him, they
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.000]   are refusing and rejecting the last hope of salvation.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.960]   And of course, what he did for them is equally true of us and in our case.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.400]   And the business of preaching, it seems to me, is to do exactly the same thing.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.480]   There are two sides to preaching.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.040]   There is the presentation of the truth.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.480]   There is the offer of the gospel of salvation.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.600]   But you read your Bible from beginning to end, and you will find that it is always accompanied
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.440]   by an indication of what happens if the offer is refused.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.800]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.440]   should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   Now there it is.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   It's wonderful, isn't it?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.640]   Yes, but remember, it goes on to say this, "For God sent not his Son into the world to
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.840]   condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.040]   He that believeth on him is not condemned.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   But he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.480]   the only begotten Son of God."
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.240]   Well, now, that's what our Lord is doing.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.720]   He's given them the positive truth.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.880]   He says, "Do you realize where you are and what your position is if you persist in that
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.880]   unbelief and in that refusal?"
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.960]   Here it is, friends.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.400]   And it is my solemn duty to do the same thing with you this evening.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:39.280]   We've worked our way through this great chapter in which the Lord makes this claim for himself
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.760]   and tells us so plainly why he's come into the world.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.080]   He's offered us life.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.840]   Am I speaking to somebody still who doesn't believe in him?
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.000]   Have you believed in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.600]   Do you realize the terrible position of not believing in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.280]   Do you realize the urgent importance of knowing for certain whether you believe in him or
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   not?
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:15.600]   That's the subject with which our Lord deals.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.840]   And here I say we are shown that position in a most amazing manner.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.240]   I see in these verses we're looking at this evening a perfect summary or epitome of the
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.560]   whole message of the Bible.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.600]   There are certain things, it seems to me, our Lord teaches here which we have got to
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.200]   realize as we value our immortal souls.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   Now what are they?
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.640]   Well, let me put them to you.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.240]   The first is this.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.640]   If we are at all concerned about ourselves and our lives and the state of our souls and
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.160]   about death and about eternity, if we are in this building at this moment, as I am I
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   think entitled to assume we are, because we are concerned about these things, why have
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.440]   you done this tonight which is such an unusual thing in the modern world?
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.280]   The vast majority of people are not doing what you are doing at this moment.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.920]   They're doing everything but this.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.020]   They regard you perhaps as a fool for having still come to a place of worship.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.020]   They're listening to the wireless.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   They're dancing.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   They're drinking.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.020]   They're gambling.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   They're doing all this.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.400]   They're here because, well, you obviously are concerned about these matters.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.560]   You may be disturbed by the state of the world.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.440]   You're beginning to ask, well, why are things going like this?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.420]   We've been told so long that when man becomes educated he'll solve his problems.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.440]   But here is the world full of problems.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440]   What is this?
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.200]   Or you may be conscious of some failure in your own life.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.680]   Or somebody dear to you has suddenly died.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.640]   Something's happened and you've thought about life.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.000]   And you say, well, now what is all this?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.080]   What is the truth about all these matters?
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080]   Very well.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.120]   If that is your position, I can tell you here in the words of our blessed Lord and Savior
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   what you've got to do.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.080]   There are just three main things that we have to do.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.580]   And here's the first.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:20.760]   We must start by realizing and accepting the supreme authority of this book which we call
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.240]   the Bible.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.640]   Now I say that if you want to be helped, if you want to know this gospel, if you want
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.300]   to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, here's a starting point.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:40.160]   You must believe and accept the authority of this book.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.880]   And when I say this book, I mean the Old Testament as well as the New.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.320]   Now here is my reason for saying that this is how our Lord puts it.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.200]   He said, had you believed Moses, there if you like is the whole of your Old Testament.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.160]   He said, you would have believed me, or still more specifically in verse 47, if you believe
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:07.320]   not his writings, how shall you believe my words?
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.700]   His writings, Old Testament.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.840]   My words, New Testament.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:18.000]   So between them we have the whole of the Bible, the Old Testament and the New.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.280]   Now this is something that is absolutely basic and fundamental.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:31.480]   You notice that our Lord in reasoning with these Jews mentions nothing else.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.920]   His writings, my words.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   Not a word about Plato and what he thought, not a word about Socrates, doesn't mention
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.780]   Aristotle.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.040]   Not a single word.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.980]   Why not?
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.320]   You see how basic this is, how fundamental?
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.160]   Here is the Son of God speaking and he is talking about authority.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.920]   And he says, this and this alone is the authority.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.080]   Your Old Testament scriptures, what I am saying to you.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.440]   Not a word about the wisdom of China.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.240]   And it was available at that time, let me remind you.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.880]   Not a word about the wisdom of Egypt, that was also known and available.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.600]   Not a word about the wisdom of Assyria, no, no.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:27.920]   He mentions nothing but the Old Testament, his own words.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.240]   I cannot emphasize this principle too much.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:42.360]   Our Lord is here teaching that there is no authoritative statement on these matters apart
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.920]   from this.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.440]   We have got it in the words of the Apostle Paul, haven't we, and they explain why our
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.240]   Lord doesn't refer to the Greek philosophers.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.880]   You know, don't you, that Plato and Socrates and Aristotle had lived before Christ ever
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.800]   came into this world.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.520]   They had given, they had poured out their magnificent teaching, they had elaborated
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.880]   their philosophical schemes, doesn't say a word about it.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   Why?
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.240]   Well, that is not authoritative.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   That is nothing but human speculation.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.520]   The Apostle Paul has told us the last word about that.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:25.080]   He said, "The world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.320]   Now Plato, Socrates and Aristotle were trying to find God.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.200]   They were great men, they were great thinkers.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.800]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.880]   My case is not that they were not great men or that they were not great thinkers.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   My case is this, that great as they were, they were in the dark because they couldn't
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:50.600]   find God, because God is eternal and everlasting, and they are only men and sinful men.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.160]   I am not telling you not to read their works, but I am telling you this, that when you have
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.760]   read them, you will know nothing more about God than you did at the beginning, because
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.880]   they didn't know.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.720]   He doesn't mention them.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:11.200]   Moses, my words, the Bible and the Bible only.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.600]   In other words, I say that if you are really serious about this question, this quest for
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:26.080]   a knowledge of God and for salvation and peace, you have got to come to this book.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.160]   I know nothing apart from what this book tells me.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.680]   I can read and I have read the philosophies and the speculations of others, but they simply
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.280]   ask questions they don't know.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.720]   They don't know God.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.080]   They don't know what happens beyond death.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.720]   They believed in some shadowy Elysium.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   They know nothing about it.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   They write about the river Styx, and there you are in the shadows and in the gloom of
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   it all.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.320]   I want knowledge, and I can't find it there.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:59.880]   It's here and here alone I find it.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.720]   It is only as we come as little children and submit to this book and its authority that
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.280]   we find the light.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.960]   And you find it, as our Lord says here in the Old Testament as well as in the New.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.600]   He said if you would believe his writings, you would believe my words.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.080]   Why, they are the same.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.240]   He wrote of me.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.360]   He said that I was coming.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   I have come.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   He said I do certain things.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   I have done.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.360]   Here I am.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   The two things are one.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.240]   Oh, my dear friend, if you haven't ever met this argument before, listen to it this evening.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.920]   Have you ever considered the unity of this book?
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:39.760]   Have you ever stood in amazement before this fact that the Old Testament and the New rarely
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.400]   have the same message?
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.080]   He was writing about me, says our Lord, about Moses.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.880]   Back you will find him in the book of Genesis.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.960]   We worked through this in detail when we were doing that 39th verse, so I am not going into
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.880]   the details again tonight.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.120]   I am simply asking you to look at the unity of the book.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   The Old looks forward to him, the New looks back upon him.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.560]   He is there in the center, one message, God, man, salvation.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:12.960]   Have you seen it?
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.720]   I assert to you again, my friend, that as long as you trust your own little mind and
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:23.080]   reason and your own speculation and your own philosophies, you will remain exactly as you
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   are now.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:31.200]   You will remain in the dark, because God can never be found by men.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.160]   Can a man by searching find out God?
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.280]   Well try it and you will find he can't.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.880]   Even these mightiest philosophers couldn't.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.000]   "Well, we come to this," I say, "why?"
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.080]   "Well, because this is inspired by God.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   This is God's book."
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.960]   "Where do you find that?" says someone.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.800]   "I'll tell you where I find it."
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.920]   Our Lord says here, "He wrote of me."
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.000]   Moses wrote of him.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.400]   When did Moses live?
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   Fourteen hundred years before Christ was born.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.720]   How could he possibly have written about Christ?
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   How could he have known anything about Christ?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.160]   There is only one explanation.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.480]   It was revealed to him by God through the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.800]   That is the claim of the Old Testament.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.440]   That is what our Lord says about the Old Testament.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.680]   It isn't I who is saying this.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   Our Lord says it.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.080]   "He wrote of me."
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.400]   God gave him the revelation.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.280]   He gave him the preview.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.680]   He gave him words.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.480]   He told him to write.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.840]   Now our Lord everywhere says that.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.960]   He believed the Old Testament as the inspired Word of God.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.760]   The prophets make the same claim.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.600]   They said, "The burden of the Lord, the message of the Lord came to me."
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.080]   These men don't come before us and say, "Now look here.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   I am a man who studied.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.920]   I have looked into this matter.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.480]   And as a result of my research, this is what I think."
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   Not at all.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.760]   A man like Amos says, "I was a man keeping a herd, but a herdsman.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   And I wasn't interested.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.440]   I didn't know about these things.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.640]   But God laid his hand upon me and gave me a message."
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:15.880]   They all say the same thing.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:21.160]   This is the inspired Word of God.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.640]   That is why I ask you to come to it and believe its authority.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.960]   That is why I ask you to come to it and say, "Well, philosophy can't help me.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   What's this?"
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.200]   See its unity.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.640]   See the inspiration.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640]   See its claim.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.680]   There is only one explanation of it.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.000]   It must be inspired.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.600]   How could these men have foretold about Bethlehem and about his being born of a virgin and about
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.680]   his arriving into Jerusalem in the foal of an ass and the thousand and one other details?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.360]   How do you explain it?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.200]   There is only one explanation.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.080]   Its inspiration.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.920]   It's the Spirit of God revealing, the Spirit of God moving the writers, as Peter puts it,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.560]   and giving him the message and the words in which to convey it.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.080]   It's inspired of God.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.400]   Therefore my dear friend, if you are concerned about your soul and about your eternal destiny,
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.080]   I say come to this.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.160]   Come on your knees to it.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.320]   Don't pit your little puny mind against it.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.360]   Your mind is much smaller than that of Plato and Socrates and Aristotle.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.400]   Very well then, I say, come as a little child, as Christ said, except ye be converted and
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.680]   become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.520]   Here it is.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:55.720]   He says for himself, Moses, my word, listen, listen for your life.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.680]   And if you want some more practical reasons for submitting to it and its authority, listen
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.160]   to this.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:11.560]   Everything you need and everything you can ever desire, you will find here.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.160]   I don't hesitate to assever at that.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   Do you want light?
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.640]   Light upon the universe, light on creation, light on man, light on the state of the world
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.440]   tonight, light on life, light on death, light on eternity, light on God?
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's here.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.320]   You want light on how to live in a decent way in this world?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.360]   You'll find it here.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.880]   You want light on how to lose the fear of death and the grave?
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   You'll get it here.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.960]   You want light on how to be joyous and happy and be filled with a spirit of peace?
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   You get it here.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.320]   It's offered here.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:05.280]   He offers life, life which is life indeed, life which is life abundant.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.760]   Come to this book.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:17.520]   It will supply and satisfy your every need, Moses and my words.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:27.720]   But I say to you, come to it for this reason, that this book, as our Lord tells these Jews
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:34.600]   on this occasion, leaves us without a single excuse.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.720]   That's the terrifying thing about it.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:46.600]   My dear friends, that's the terrifying thing about preaching.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:55.160]   That I know that even my feeble words will rise up in the judgment against those who
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.200]   have heard them but haven't believed them.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   Our Lord says it here.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:07.360]   He says, look here, there is one that accuses you, even Moses in whom you trust.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.280]   The very words you read Sunday by Sunday will rise against you in the judgment and condemn
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   you.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.840]   Now our Lord himself said that about his own words.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.760]   You'll find it at the end of the twelfth chapter of this gospel according to St. John
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.960]   where he makes the thing perfectly plain in these words.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:31.920]   He says, if any men hear my words and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.160]   the world but to save the world.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:40.040]   He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judges him.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.120]   So you see it's perfectly plain.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:58.000]   He says the words of Moses and his words will rise against men in the judgment and ask them
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   why they didn't believe them.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:16.160]   If I had not come and spoken unto them, said our Lord later on, then had they not had sin.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:22.320]   But now have they no cloak for their sin.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.880]   It's a terrifying thought this, but because this book has got everything that we need,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:33.440]   has got an answer to all our questions, and can supply our every need, this book becomes
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.480]   our condemnation if we don't believe it.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:43.640]   It will leave us speechless and without a single answer on the day of judgment.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:51.760]   So I beseech you, as you value your immortal soul, come to this book, submit to it and
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   its authority.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.480]   You've failed outside, you've failed without it.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.240]   Well come to this and humble yourself before it.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.640]   Read it as a little child, let it speak to you.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.000]   That's the first principle.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.320]   The second principle which our Lord emphasizes is this one, the importance of being right
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.520]   and clear about the message of the book.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:26.600]   You notice how he puts it to these Jews, he says I will not accuse you to the Father,
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:36.880]   but there is one that will accuse you, even Moses, in whom you trust.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.880]   What does he mean?
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   He means this.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:46.280]   These Jews who were refusing to believe in him were great readers of the Old Testament
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.560]   and were great believers in the Old Testament.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.400]   It was their proud boast that they were the only nation in the world that had the oracles
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   of God.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:01.640]   Moses, they say, Moses belongs to us and the Fathers and the Prophets, look at those Gentiles,
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.200]   they don't have Moses.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:12.160]   They've got the scriptures, the living oracles of God, and they trusted in them.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:18.000]   And yet you see what our Lord is telling them is this, that though they thought such a lot
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.960]   of the scriptures, they didn't believe them.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:27.520]   He said, had you believed Moses, he would have believed me, for he wrote to me.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:37.160]   But if you believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my work?
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.080]   There is nothing that I know of that is quite as alarming as this.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:49.920]   Here were these Jews bursting of the scriptures and yet misunderstanding them, reading them
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.480]   every Sunday, listening to the interpretations, and yet they had so misinterpreted them that
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.320]   they completely missed the message.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:12.400]   And men and women are still doing the same thing with an open Bible.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:19.440]   Christianity is being entirely misunderstood by large numbers of people today.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.400]   I know of nothing more terrifying than this.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:32.800]   People in the name of Christ are saying things, but it's not the gospel.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.200]   The very oracles of God opened before us can mean nothing.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.600]   We can misinterpret them.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.960]   The Jews were doing it.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.480]   I say men and women are still doing it.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.880]   They say this gospel is nothing but some kind of political, social matter.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.800]   I ought to be preaching tonight on that racial problem in South Africa, or I ought to be
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.200]   preaching about the atomic bomb.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.760]   That's Christianity apparently.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.360]   It's just one great message, and that's the kind of message it is.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.720]   And they denounce the preaching of the blood of Christ and his atoning sacrifice and things
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:14.480]   like that with a Bible open before them.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:22.200]   So I don't apologize for putting a simple and a blunt question to you at this moment.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.760]   What in your opinion is Christianity?
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.360]   What in your opinion is a Christian?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.880]   What makes a man a Christian?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:41.960]   Is it that he just holds certain social views, or that he lives a certain moral kind of life,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.120]   or that he makes some great sacrifice for humanity?
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.560]   Is that the thing that makes a man a Christian?
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:55.880]   With the Bible open before you, I ask you, what is the message of the book?
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:04.160]   I press the question upon you because our Lord himself taught that men and women with
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.800]   the book open before them could completely misunderstand it.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:16.440]   Very well then, that brings me to my third and my last heading, which is this.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.120]   What is the message of the book?
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:30.280]   The Old Testament, the New Testament, Moses, Jesus Christ, what is it?
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.840]   He wrote of me, what does he say?
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.600]   What is the message of the Old Testament right through?
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.880]   What's the message of the New Testament from beginning to end?
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.360]   Well, let me remind you of the essence of the message as our Lord himself summarizes
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.280]   it here in these three verses.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:32:01.520]   The first great message of the Bible is the message about judgment.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.200]   Think not that I will accuse you to the Father.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:13.000]   There is one that shall accuse you, even Moses.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.240]   What's he talking about?
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:21.040]   Well, he is introducing here, I say, this tremendous teaching of the Bible concerning
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.440]   judgment.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   What does it mean?
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.520]   Well, let me repeat it to you as quietly and as solemnly as I can.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:40.160]   It means that man is a moral and a responsible being.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:49.700]   He has been made in the image of God, and he is accountable to God.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.920]   Do you think of yourself like that?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.440]   Do you say to yourself every day of your life, "I'm a moral, responsible being.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   I am accountable to God"?
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:11.160]   It's the teaching of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.760]   Our conscience alone teaches us this.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.320]   It tells us, it condemns us and condemns action.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.240]   The conscience is speaking that, but this book tells so much more clearly.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.880]   God's law teaches that.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.040]   Moses, ten commandments, moral law.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   What is it?
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:37.480]   Well, it's a revelation of God and God in the character of judgment.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.600]   But you even find it in the history.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   You remember what happened in the Garden of Eden?
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:53.080]   Adam and Eve were driven out, and the cherubim and the flaming sword were placed at the east
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.800]   gate of the Garden, prohibiting a return.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   What is it?
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   Judgment.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   The ground has been cursed.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:05.160]   Man earns his bread by the sweat of his brow.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   What is it?
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   Judgment.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:16.400]   The flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the captivity into Assyria and the captivity of Babylon,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:24.360]   all this is but God indicating that he's the judge and that man is morally responsible,
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.760]   even in history.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   What else?
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:45.640]   Well, the second thing is this, that death is not the end, that man is not a mere animal,
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.320]   that man goes on living beyond death.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:58.080]   Read your Old Testament, read your New Testament, listen to the words of Christ, and that is
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   what he tells you.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   "Thus thou art a dust-returnest," was not spoken of the soul.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.720]   Death is not the end, my friend.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.880]   Had you realized that, that's the message of this book.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.440]   Men and women are living tonight on the assumption that death is the end.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.640]   "Let's have a good time this year, let's do what I feel like doing.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.000]   Don't listen to this morality, don't listen to religion, get rid of this nonsense about
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   God.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.240]   Have a good time, do what you want to do, and when you die, that's the end."
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:39.640]   If men and women but realized that death is not the end, they wouldn't live as they do.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.880]   It is in their ignorance and blindness, on that very scar, that they do live as they
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.880]   do.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   Why do they do it?
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   They haven't read this book.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.960]   They haven't learned its message, that death is not the end.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   What then?
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   Well, the day of judgment.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.200]   "I'm not going to accuse you," he says, "there is someone."
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   What's he talking about?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:07.320]   Well, he's talking about a day of judgment.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:15.760]   It is in the Bible from the beginning to the end.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:21.680]   Every one of us shall have to stand before God.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:33.120]   It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:38.160]   This book tells us that every one of us will have to stand that day before God and give
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:45.640]   an account of the deeds done in the body, of how we've lived in this world and what
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.280]   we've done with our souls and what we've done to God's image upon us.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.880]   Every one of us will have to do it.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   The judgment, the accusation, the terms are there.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:02.680]   There'll be an accuser, there'll be a public prosecutor, and we are told exactly the evidence
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.880]   he'll produce.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.280]   There are books and records in which our every action is recorded.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.720]   I am not saying this.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.920]   It's the Bible that says it, this thing that Christ asks you to believe.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.000]   It's all in the Old Testament.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.040]   It's there in the New Testament.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.320]   These are the terms.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:39.080]   And finally, the judgment that will be pronounced at that great day will be a final judgment.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.200]   There'll be no possibility of an appeal.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.680]   There'll be no second chance.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.600]   There's not a word about that in the whole of the Bible.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:55.160]   Our Lord himself said it in the parable of Dioves and Lazarus, "A great gulf is fixed,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:01.280]   and there's no passage from heaven to hell or from hell to heaven."
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:11.720]   It is a final judgment, irrevocable and everlasting.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:19.840]   Listen to him saying it, "I will not accuse you, but there is one that shall accuse you,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.280]   Moses, whom you've been reading and whom you trust."
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.000]   Listen to him.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   What else do you read of in the Bible?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.720]   Well, the next thing is this, sin and condemnation.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:46.280]   Here is man, a responsible being, going on through life to death and to stand before
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.960]   God at the last day.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   What are his chances?
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   What are his prospects?
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:39:02.800]   Well, the Bible tells us that a great calamity has happened in the history and the story
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   of mankind.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:12.840]   It calls it the fall of man, that man sinned and rebelled against God and thus has brought
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:18.800]   himself under condemnation and under the wrath of God.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.400]   Now people in their folly say they don't like that, and because they don't like it,
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   they don't believe it.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.080]   They say, "I believe in a positive gospel of salvation."
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.960]   But my dear friend, let me ask you a question.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.120]   What do you need to be saved from?
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.240]   Why is salvation necessary?
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:43.160]   Why did God tell Adam and Eve at the beginning about the seed of the woman that should bruise
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.480]   the serpent's head?
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:51.880]   Why in Moses and his writings is there all this about the lamb and the sacrifice and
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   the offering?
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.960]   What's its meaning?
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   Why salvation?
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:02.840]   It's because man is condemned and condemned in sin.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:11.680]   The Bible's message is that we have all sinned and have come short of the glory of
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:24.800]   God, that we are all the children of wrath, that every one of us is guilty in the sight
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.120]   of this holy God.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   It goes further.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.600]   It tells us that not one of us can save ourselves.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.320]   These Jews thought that they could save themselves.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:45.880]   That was how they had misinterpreted the writings of Moses.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.960]   They said, "We've got the law, and the fact that we've got the law means that we
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.600]   must be special favorites of God."
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.200]   And then they thought, "Ah, if we keep the law," and they interpreted that in their
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   own way, they said, "We'll satisfy God."
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:06.880]   Saul of Tarsus thought that he was pleasing God and saving himself by living the law.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:16.760]   He then saw that not only had he not done it, that no one else had done it, and that
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.680]   no one else can ever do it.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:30.800]   And so he came to write this, "Therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:41.120]   justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   Have you read Moses?
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.600]   Have you read the condemnation?
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.480]   It is this, that every one of us sinned in Adam, that every one of us has sinned for
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.480]   himself.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:42:02.320]   And therefore we are under the wrath of God and are guilty in his holy sight.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:08.200]   And though we may decide tonight to go out and enter a monastery and fast and sweat and
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:14.120]   pray and do good, we can never save ourselves, we can never satisfy.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.160]   The law of Moses condemns us.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   We are all lost.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:28.840]   We have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.280]   That is the accusation of Moses.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:43.080]   Thank God I don't stop there, but this is the message of the Bible, the word of God,
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   man in sin and condemnation.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:54.640]   Moses says it, Christ says it, but there is something else, the message about the Savior
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   and about the salvation.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.240]   Moses, he says, wrote of me.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.440]   Then he says, "My words."
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   What is he talking about?
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.440]   Well, what he is saying is this.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.400]   He is calling their attention to his own person.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   "Look at me," he says.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:25.560]   "You who believe in Moses and who know him so well, look at me.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.840]   Can't you see he wrote of me?
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.120]   Have you read about the paschal lamb?
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   Look at me.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   Listen to the testimony of John.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:42.720]   Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the whole world.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.920]   Have you read of the lamb slain in the morning, slain at night, every day in the temple and
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   the tabernacle?
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   Look at me.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   Moses wrote of me."
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:44:03.640]   Do you remember how he said at the end of his life, "Another prophet shall God raise
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.440]   up unto you, like unto me?
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.800]   Look at me," he says.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.960]   I am that prophet, the prophet that you have been expecting.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:19.280]   What he is saying is this, that he is the center of the book, the center of the universe,
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.280]   the center of history.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:30.640]   The whole of the Bible is about Jesus Christ.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.200]   He is the seed of the woman.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.320]   He is the Shiloh that was promised.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.560]   He is the scepter that shall come to Jacob.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.360]   He is the star of which we read.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:53.800]   He is the type, the anti-type, to which all the types together promise and to which they
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.000]   point.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.560]   He is the one that the prophets sang about and spoke about.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.920]   He is the suffering servant of Isaiah.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.760]   He is the babe that is going to be born in Bethlehem.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.440]   It is all about him.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   He wrote of me.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.480]   Look at him.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.120]   Behold him.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.720]   Listen to him as he asks these Jews to look at him.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.880]   He is the Son of God.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.840]   He has come from heaven.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.360]   He is the center of history.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.240]   Everything converges on him.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.840]   He is the new man.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.640]   He is the second Adam.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.600]   He is God's way of deliverance and of salvation.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:44.160]   The Bible, this book I am asking you to believe and to submit to, follow it and it will bring
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.320]   you to him.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:52.200]   He wrote of me.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:46:01.040]   But it not only tells us who he is, it tells us why he came into this world.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:08.800]   Why did the Son of God come into the world and be born as that babe in Bethlehem?
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   Why has he done it all?
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.960]   Well, he tells us here not to condemn.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.840]   There is no need for him to condemn.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.680]   Moses does the condemnation.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.520]   Before Christ ever came, the whole world was condemned.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.840]   He came because it was condemned.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:35.440]   The Son of Man, he said, has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.280]   They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:45.000]   I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.800]   What was it that led the Son to leave the eternal bosom and to humble himself and to
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.280]   be born miraculously of a virgin?
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.520]   Why did he do it?
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:59.280]   I say it is because the whole world is damned and lost and condemned under the wrath of
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   God.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   He has not come to condemn.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   Moses condemns.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   The law of God condemns us.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   No, no, he has not come to condemn.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   He has come to save.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.280]   And he came because he alone could save.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   There was no need for him to condemn.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   He has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   There is no need for him to condemn.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   The Son of Man, he said, has come to seek and to humble himself and to be born miraculously
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   of a virgin.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   What was it that led the Son of Man?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   He came because it was condemned.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   The Son of Man, he said, has come to seek and to humble himself and to be born miraculously.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   The law of God condemns us.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   No, no, he has not come to condemn.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   He has come to seek and to humble himself and to be born miraculously of a virgin.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:51.720]   Look at him, he's here to save, not to accuse.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:57.120]   I say he came to save because none other could.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:04.560]   But he can and he did.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.880]   And how did he do it?
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:17.880]   Oh, his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we, being dead unto
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.720]   sin, should live unto righteousness.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.600]   He didn't save by preaching the Sermon on the Mount alone.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:31.280]   And no man saves himself by trying to practice the Christian ethic.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:38.600]   It is Christ who saves and he alone, and he saves by bearing our sins in his own body
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.800]   on the tree.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.200]   He came to die.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.580]   He came to taste death for every man.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:48.360]   He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.300]   It's the only way to save.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.200]   And he took it, he went.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.760]   He has resisted even unto blood.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:00.160]   That's what he's telling these men.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.200]   I haven't come to accuse you.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.880]   I've come to save you.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   I've come to save you from the accusation, the accusation of Moses and his law.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.040]   And he came and he did it.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:25.480]   He bore the punishment of our sins there on Calvary's cross.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:33.240]   The wrath of God was poured out upon him and because of that, God gives me forgiveness
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:40.000]   as a free gift with nothing in me, everything in Christ.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.200]   I am vile, I am sinful, I am ungodly.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.280]   I have nothing to save for myself.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:53.880]   It's all in him and he gives it me as the free gift of his love.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:50:03.520]   Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:09.840]   God has set forth as a propitiation through faith in his blood, there it is.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:16.040]   It's in him and in him alone.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:21.400]   And that is what he was offering those Jews.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.360]   And that is what he is offering you at this minute.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:35.160]   Free forgiveness, reconciliation unto God, a new life, a new principle within you to
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.640]   be made a child of God and blessings more than you can ever understand.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:59.160]   He will so bless you that you will say with Charles Wesley, "Just and holy is thy name.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.160]   I am all unrighteousness.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Vile and full of sin I am.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   Thou art full of truth and grace.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:18.520]   Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:26.400]   Plenteous grace in thee is found, grace to cover all my sin.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:34.080]   Let the healing streams abound, make me, keep me pure within.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:41.000]   Thou of life the fountain of, freely let me take of thee.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:48.520]   Spring thou up within my heart, rile to all eternity."
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.600]   That's why he's come, to do that.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.320]   The judgment is coming and there will be an accuser.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.520]   Who will be that accuser?
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.240]   Listen to Paul answering the question.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:09.840]   "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?"
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:17.880]   "Who is going to charge us?" he asks at that red day of judgment.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.560]   It is God that justifies.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.520]   Who is he that condemns?
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520]   Is it Christ?
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:32.760]   "No, no," says Paul, "it is Christ that dieth, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.480]   at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.240]   He won't accuse us.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   He's come to save.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   Moses and the law are the accusers.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:50.120]   Christ will never accuse.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:57.280]   He it is who came and died for us and rose again.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:09.880]   My dear friend, have you pictured yourself beyond this life, beyond death?
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:16.800]   Do you know that you are going on to that judgment?
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.880]   You are.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.480]   We all are.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:31.240]   But the Son of God has come from heaven to save you.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:36.080]   You need not go to wrath and perdition.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:43.520]   You can enter into the joy of your Lord and spend your eternity there, but there's only
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.520]   one way for that.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:56.440]   And there it is to go to him, acknowledging and confessing your sin and shame and failure,
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   believing that he is the eternal Son of God and that he came into this world to bear the
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:22.800]   punishment of your sins and thereby silence and answer the accusation of the law of God.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   He that believeth is not condemned to leave, and be ye saved and safe for all eternity.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.440]   Amen.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
