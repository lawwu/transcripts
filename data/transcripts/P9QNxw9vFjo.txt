[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Can our good works outweigh our bad works?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The short answer to this vital question is, of course, no.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   But why not? That's a question we must all be able to answer from Scripture.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And it's a question John Piper answered from Romans 14, verse 23,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   in his message, "What is Sin? The Essence and Root of All Sinning,"
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   preached on February 2nd of this year.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Here's what John Piper said.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   The reason Paul says that whatever is not from faith is sin, in Romans 14, verse 23,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   is that faith is a receiving of Christ and God in Christ
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   as a desperately needed Savior,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   a Lord with whom we are happily compliant,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and a treasure that we esteem above everything.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I'll say that again.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Faith is a receiving of Christ for all that He is.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It's a receiving of Christ as a Savior I desperately need in my sin,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   receiving of Him a Lord in whom I happily comply,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and a treasure that satisfies my soul,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and I treasure it above all other treasures in the world.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   That's what faith is.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Therefore, whatever is not from faith is sin,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   because Romans 1 to 3 said,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   "The root of sin is preferring anything to God,"
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which faith doesn't do.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Faith prefers God over all things.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   So here I am in Knoxville, Tennessee last summer,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   realizing as never before that a horrible and glorious thing was being shown me,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   the horrible and glorious truth that the reason my justification,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   my right standing with God,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   cannot be founded on 99.99% grace and Christ
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and 0.01% contribution of a good deed from unregenerate John Piper,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   or regenerate John Piper is that there are no good deeds before regeneration, none.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   After regeneration, they're all imperfect.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So the question for the unbeliever is not,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   how many times have you heard people set this up?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   The question for the unbeliever is not,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   "Can I do enough good works to outweigh my bad works?"
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   No, the question is, "Can I do one good work?"
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And the answer is no,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   which is why justification, our right standing with God,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   has to be not 99.99% grace and Christ,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   but 100% and that's the way he saved us.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   By grace alone, on the basis of Christ alone,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   through faith alone, to the glory of God's infinite,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   beautiful, superior worth alone.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And so I experienced as perhaps never before,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   a devastation and liberation and sweetness
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   that I have been praying for you for a long time.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Amen.

[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   [Silence]
