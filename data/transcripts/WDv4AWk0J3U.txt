[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   but I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.000]   on that phone screen,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.280]   it's not bright enough to trigger that cortisol spike.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.600]   And for me to be at my most alert
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.640]   and focused throughout the day
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.180]   and to optimize my sleep at night.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040]   So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.360]   And if it's a bright, clear day
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.200]   and the sun is low in the sky
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   or the sun is starting to get overhead,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.720]   what we call low solar angle,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.760]   then I know I'm getting outside at the right time.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.800]   If there's cloud cover and I can't see the sun,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.400]   I also know I'm doing a good thing
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.560]   because it turns out, especially on cloudy days,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   you want to get outside and get as much light energy
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.420]   or photons in your eyes.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.320]   But let's say it's a very clear day
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.440]   and I can see where the sun is.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.240]   I do not need to stare directly into the sun.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.420]   If it's very low in the sky,
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.920]   I might do that because it's not going to be very painful
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.760]   to my eyes.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.060]   However, if the sun is a little bit brighter
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.520]   and a little bit higher in the sky,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.220]   sometimes it can be painful to look at.
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.940]   So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.600]   is to look toward the sun.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.940]   If it's too bright to look at directly,
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.920]   well then don't do that.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.200]   You just look toward it, but not directly at it.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.360]   It's absolutely fine to blink.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.640]   In fact, I encourage you to blink
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.080]   whenever you feel the impulse to blink.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840]   Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.500]   that's so bright that it's painful to look at
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.140]   'cause you can damage your eyes.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.460]   But for this morning sunlight viewing,
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.500]   it's best to not wear sunglasses.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.900]   That's right, to not wear sunglasses,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.620]   at least for this morning sunlight viewing.
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.260]   It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses,
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.380]   so-called corrective lenses.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.460]   In fact, those will serve you well in this practice
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.340]   or this tool because they will focus the light
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.300]   onto your neural retina and onto those melanopsin
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.380]   intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.780]   If your eyeglasses or contact lenses have UV protection,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.940]   that's okay.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.380]   There's so many different wavelengths of light
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.060]   coming from the sun and they are bright enough
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.740]   that they will trigger the mechanisms
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.540]   that you want triggered at this early time of day.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.220]   So try and get outside,
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.040]   ideally within the first five minutes of waking,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.860]   or maybe it's 15 minutes,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.420]   but certainly within the first hour after waking.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.540]   I want to share with you three critical things
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.900]   about this tool of morning sunlight viewing.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.680]   First of all, this is not some woo biology thing.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.620]   This is grounded in the core of our physiology.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.900]   There are literally hundreds,
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.180]   if not thousands of quality peer reviewed papers
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.660]   showing that light viewing early in the day
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.040]   is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.880]   throughout the day,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.000]   and it has a powerful positive impact on your ability
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.580]   to fall and stay asleep at night.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.540]   So this is really the foundational power tool
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.160]   for ensuring a great night's sleep
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.740]   and for feeling more awake during the day.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.240]   Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.960]   you can and probably should flip on artificial lights
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.380]   in your internal home environment or apartment
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.760]   or wherever you happen to live,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.640]   if your goal is to be awake, right?
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.720]   If you wake up at four in the morning
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.600]   and you need to be awake,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.120]   well then turn on artificial lights.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.220]   Once the sun is out, however, once the sun has risen,
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.960]   then you still want to get outside and view sunlight.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.880]   Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.140]   and if you're asking whether or not
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.600]   turning on artificial lights can replace sunlight
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.480]   at those hours, unfortunately, the answer is no.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160]   Unless you have a very special light,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.920]   we'll talk about what kind of light,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.960]   the bright artificial lights in your home environment
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.520]   are not, I repeat,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.840]   are not going to be sufficiently bright
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.800]   to turn on the cortisol mechanism
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.340]   and the other wake-up mechanisms
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.680]   that you need early in the day.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.280]   The diabolical twist, however,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   is that those lights in your home or apartment
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.060]   or even on your phone are bright enough
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.080]   to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.320]   or in the middle of the night.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.520]   So there's this asymmetry in our retinal, our eye biology,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.200]   and in our brain's biology,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.220]   whereby early in the day, right around waking,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.680]   you need a lot of light, a lot of photons,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.840]   a lot of light energy,
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.020]   and artificial lights generally just won't accomplish
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.560]   what you need them to accomplish.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.600]   But at night, even a little bit of artificial light
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.080]   can really mess up your so-called circadian,
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.440]   your 24-hour clocks
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.520]   and all these mechanisms that we're talking about.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.340]   So if you wake up before the sun is out
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.620]   and it's still dark,
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.280]   please turn on as many bright artificial lights
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.400]   as you possibly can or need,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.520]   but then get outside once the sun is out.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.060]   On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.320]   I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.400]   you especially need to get outside and get sunlight.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.840]   You just need to get more of it.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.120]   Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need?
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.320]   This is going to vary depending on person and place,
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.960]   literally where you live on earth,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.040]   whether or not there's a lot of tree cover,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.840]   whether or not you're somebody who has sensitive eyes
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   or less sensitive eyes.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.320]   It's really impossible for me
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.160]   to give an absolute prescriptive,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.880]   but we can give some general guidelines.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.840]   In general, on a clear day,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.680]   meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover,
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.640]   you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.240]   for about five minutes or so.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.120]   Could be three minutes one day, could be seven minutes
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.880]   the next day, about five minutes.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.220]   On a day where there's cloud cover,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.040]   so the sun is just peeking through the clouds
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.320]   or it's more dense cloud cover,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.880]   you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.320]   to your eyes early in the day.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.760]   And on days that are really densely overcast
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.080]   or maybe even a rainy,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.240]   you're going to want to get as much as 20 or 30 minutes
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.280]   of sunlight exposure.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.880]   Another key thing is do not forget about,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.640]   just don't try and get this sunlight exposure
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.600]   through a windshield of a car or a window,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.040]   whether or not it's tinted or otherwise.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.620]   It takes far too long.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.700]   It's simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.000]   You would be standing there all day,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.780]   trying to get enough light into your eyes
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.680]   from the morning sunlight.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.900]   And by then the sun will have already moved
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.920]   from low solar angle to overhead.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.020]   And it simply won't work for all sorts of mechanisms
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.140]   related to your circadian rhythm functions.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.340]   So just don't try and do it through a windshield,
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.660]   sunglasses, or a window.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.620]   It's just not going to work.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.640]   Get outside.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.860]   If the weather is really bad or for whatever reason,
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.620]   safety reasons, you cannot get outside.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.460]   Well, then I suppose, try and get near a window.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.500]   That would be the last, last resort,
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.460]   but you really want to get outside
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.420]   to get the sunlight exposure.
