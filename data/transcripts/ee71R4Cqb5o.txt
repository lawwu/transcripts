[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Okay so in the last video we put together our API using Python and that
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.760]   includes our full Q&A stack where we can begin asking questions and getting
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.000]   answers. So now what we're going to do is start working on the front end which is
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.800]   going to be in Angular. Now if you haven't used Angular before that's fine
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.880]   I'm really definitely not an expert so we can learn together and if you haven't
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.560]   installed Angular before or will use it or I assume if you don't use it you
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.560]   probably don't have it installed then I'm going to link right at the top of
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.760]   this video description to a article or like a guide I'll find one or if I can't
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560]   find a good one I'll just write one describing exactly what you need to do
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.600]   in order to get to this point that you can see on the screen now which is the
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.880]   node.js command prompt and on Windows you can also run this from command from
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.440]   the command line or from your bash instance if you've installed everything
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.320]   properly and I think it's pretty much the same it's probably a lot easier on
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.220]   Linux or Mac. So now that we're here I'm going to switch across into the
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.760]   directory that I want to create the front end application so I'm going to be
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.520]   using two different directories one for the back end one for the front end and
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.200]   we're going to navigate into the directory that we want to put our front
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:57.080]   end directory. So it will be documents projects for me and then here I'm going
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.320]   to create a new directory called Aurelius front end. Now I'm not going to
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.160]   do that the usual way with make dir, instead what we're going to do is
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.360]   initialize our application which will also initialize our directory using the
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.060]   Angular CLI. Now anything Angular CLI begins with NG which is just Angular. NG
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.280]   is sort of short for Angular. And what I want to do is create a new application
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.200]   I'm going to call it Aurelius front end
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.880]   and then we're gonna get a load of questions here I'm going to say yes to
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.600]   all of them and then when it asks what style sheet format would like to use
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.480]   we're going to be using material, Angular material here and if we want to later on
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.840]   modify the color theme with Angular material we really want to be using SCSS
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.120]   so we'll just start straight away with that and as well SCSS we can just write
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.880]   normal CSS and it will work as we as it normally would so there's really nothing
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:26.760]   to lose. Okay and that's just going to print loads of stuff to the screen and
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:35.400]   hopefully tell us everything is good. Okay so that's all ready so what I'm
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.920]   going to do now is head over to VS Code and open this directory. Okay so now
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.640]   we're in VS Code, opened the new Aurelius front-end directory and first
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.960]   thing we want to do is open our terminal and all I want to do is ng serve to make
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.760]   sure that everything is set up correctly so this will initialize an instance of
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:18.440]   our app which we can then open up in our browser. It might take a little bit of
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:32.760]   time the first first go it should be pretty quick. Okay it's cool now we go to
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:42.140]   our browser localhost 4200 and we should get this yep so this is like the initial
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.880]   screen that you get with any Angular app so that just means that well it's worked
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.320]   so that's that's good and what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this down
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.560]   here to start initializing different parts of our app later on we're not
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.480]   actually going to do that right now because the first thing I want to do is
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.080]   actually just get it set up and get Angular Material set up because Angular
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.440]   Material is going to be essentially our design of the entire app which is really
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.600]   easy to use but it can be really annoying if you don't set up first thing.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:32.800]   So I'm gonna stop that and I'm going to add Angular Material to our application
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:47.560]   to do that we do ng add Angular Material and this will install Angular Material
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.760]   in our app and we we don't really have to do anything the only thing we
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.360]   actually have to do here so we have to say which theme we'd like to use I'm
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   just gonna go indigo pink so these are the default colors that you can use and
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   I think we're probably gonna change these later on anyway but let's see for
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.800]   now at least we're gonna stick with indigo pink here we say yes yes and let
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:28.720]   install that's installed now so if we head over to src app and app module TS
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.920]   we should be able to see everything in here
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   so there are a couple of things that we installed just now like extra things and
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:56.680]   that was the browser animations and that's what you see here okay now when
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   we're using Angular Material we tend to add another module so Angular has all
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.720]   these different modules and this is like the almost like a control panel for
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   where we import things so we import different packages into this script and
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:24.560]   then that allows us to use it across all of our other web page files and what we
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.320]   can do is create two of these scripts so that we have two versions of it one of
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   them is just going to be used for our material Angular Material imports which
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.440]   is anything to do with how our app looks and essentially works when we're
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.400]   clicking around the reason we do that is because it can just get really messy if
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:59.440]   you have everything in one so to do that we all we do is add material module TS
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   and because this is like a duplicate of this package all I'll do is take that
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   code and just modify it a little bit so in here we basically want to get rid of
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.200]   all of these imports except for an ng-module and we can also get rid of
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.480]   declarations so we just have imports and we also want to add an exports array as
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:40.240]   well so this is like whenever we import a certain module from material Angular
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.920]   Material so things like buttons menus all these sort of things we're going to
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.280]   import it top and I'm going to show you how in just a moment and then we're
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.840]   going to add it to the imports array here and also the exports array and that
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.120]   will allow us to use it in the rest of our app now the only thing we need to change here is
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.160]   modify this to be material module and let's go ahead and import our first
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:15.560]   component which is going to be mat button module and we're importing that
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:23.440]   from @angular material so this is the package that we installed before and
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:32.640]   kite is finding the the right directory there so it's material button okay we'll
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.840]   copy this and we remove these because we're not importing these in this file
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   just add it to mat button module and also the exports okay so now we can use
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.520]   this module in the rest of our code and this is a material button so it's like a
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:10:00.720]   fancy looking button so now let's exit that and go over to our app module TS so
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.840]   this is like the mothership of all of our code everything goes through this
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.560]   including that other module even though it's like a duplicate so to include that
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.880]   we do what we've done here so you see we have this browser animations module
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.160]   we're gonna do is that same thing we have it there we also have it in this
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:29.840]   imports array so to import that module that we just made so if I have a look
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.880]   here we see that it's called material module so let's copy that send it over
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   here because you see over here we're exporting it to the rest of the code so
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.000]   that means it can be read by this app module TS so import it and we do from
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.680]   and this will probably figure it out maybe maybe not material material module
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   there okay so that is now imported that into this script and what we want to do
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.680]   is include it in the import array there now it's accessible by the rest of our
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:17.640]   code so that's I know it's quite a lot but that's material basically self and
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.600]   just so we can see that it's actually working let's just add that material
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:30.800]   button into the very front page of this app so the very front page of this app
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   is app component HTML so you saw before we had that kind of fancy initial page
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.480]   or it gave us a few hints on what we should do next and that is everything
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:53.040]   that you see in here so we're going to just select all and delete this and all
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:00.320]   I want to add in here is a button and it's a material button so Mac burn like
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:10.520]   this and we're gonna put search okay now if we go back into our browser let's
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.840]   make sure it's I don't think it's running I think we have to restart yeah
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:23.840]   so ng serve again spin up the server if we head over so this should go in a
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:31.920]   moment and we'll just get a button in the top left okay so now we have our
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.040]   button and you see we get this kind of nice little we go over it gets
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.640]   highlighted and when we click it we have that nice ripple effect so that's our
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:50.680]   material button and I think that's it for this first video on the front end so
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.920]   we've initialized our front end and also included material or angler material in
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:08.320]   there as well now from now on it's I think we will probably just build how
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.880]   this front page looks a little bit to make it look kind of nice and then we
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.680]   won't go crazy by the way we'll just make it look bearable and then we'll add
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.400]   in the functionality so that we can search on here rather than through the
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.760]   API so it should be pretty cool I think so that's it for this video and I'll see
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.240]   you in the next one
