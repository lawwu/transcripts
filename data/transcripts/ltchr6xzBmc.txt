[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.760]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.480]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.600]   Great questions as always.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.040]   We got our first audio question this week,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.880]   which we're very excited about.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.140]   - Exciting.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.760]   - Today's show is sponsored by Future Proof.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.680]   Futureproof.advisorscircle.com.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.600]   Got a couple things were mentioned here.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   The Hyatt is already sold out.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.200]   The rest of the hotel rooms are selling out fast.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.960]   So hurry up and get there and book your hotel
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.800]   because you're not gonna have a spot.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.960]   I think there's like four hotels there.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.260]   I liked the Paseo last time.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.100]   That was my favorite. - That was cool.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.940]   I liked that, yeah.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.400]   - There's plenty of good ones.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   Qualifying advisors, $200 off at futureproof.advisorscircle.com/downtown.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.360]   We're going to have a live Animal Spirits there.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.820]   We're gonna have a live Compound and Friends there.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.480]   We're gonna have a live Ask the Compound there.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.320]   It's gonna be great.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.880]   Gonna be tons of good speakers.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.720]   Good food, good drinks, good weather, good scenery.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.480]   It's gonna be, and plus for me living in Michigan,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.740]   it's like an extension of summer
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.580]   'cause it happens in, what, the middle of September?
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.200]   - Right. - And so it's another way
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.380]   to like keep that summer going a little bit.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.680]   - Also, yeah. - Great time.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.480]   - Hit the Rocky, hit the Rocky video.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.840]   Maybe, maybe this will jog some memories
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.560]   from our long time Animal Spirits viewers.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   But last year we had Mike and Ben do the Rocky,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.680]   the classic Rocky scene.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.160]   So yeah, we're already thinking about
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.080]   what we're gonna do this year.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.980]   So keep your eyes peeled. - Rocking Apollo on the beach.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.480]   Yeah, that was, I still can't believe
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.320]   you guys talked me into doing that.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.880]   - My favorite part is this one.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920]   - Yeah, we really did it.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   All right, let's do our first question.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.720]   - Okay, up first today we have a question from,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.320]   oh, I don't have their name here.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.080]   Okay, my target date fund does a lot worse than SPY.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.300]   Should I just move to an index fund for my 403B?
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.360]   - Great question, and I think one
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120]   a lot of investors grapple with.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.080]   So the S&P 500 is doing better than my portfolio.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.760]   Why don't I just put all my money in there?
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.360]   Why don't we look at an example of why a target date fund
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.720]   is underperforming the S&P 500?
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.760]   So John, do a chart on it. - Did this hurt your feelings
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.560]   a little bit, though, that they're kinda taking a shot
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   at target date funds?
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.220]   - No, I don't think it's a shot
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.440]   because I think a lot of people
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.560]   don't understand benchmarking,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.440]   which is what I wanna talk about.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.640]   So John, do this chart on.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.680]   I just, I don't know what target date fund
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.180]   this person is in, so I just picked a Vanguard 2055 fund
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.440]   to see what's under the hood.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.020]   So this is roughly 90% in stocks,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.960]   split between 60% U.S. stocks, 40% international stocks,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.640]   which is about the global weighting of the market cap,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360]   10% in U.S. bonds and international bonds.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.160]   So now, John, go to the next chart here.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.640]   This just shows the gains this year.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.440]   The S&P's up like 14%.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.160]   This target date fund's up 11% or so.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.480]   So why is this the case?
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.440]   Well, it's pretty simple.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.280]   Bonds are only up around 3% this year,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.600]   U.S. and international.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.060]   Stock market's up 14 to 15%.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.600]   International stocks are up like 10 to 12%.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.960]   So listen, if your target portfolio
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.440]   is a 100% asset allocation
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.920]   to the largest stocks in the United States
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.720]   and you're underperforming the SPY,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.760]   then something is wrong.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   There's a problem there, right?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.960]   You're underperforming.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.520]   But if your target allocation is something different
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.220]   and you're using the S&P 500 as a benchmark,
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.240]   then you're comparing apples to oranges here.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.400]   It's not the same thing, right?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.520]   That's one specific market.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   It's one specific style of investing.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   Now, it could be the case
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.180]   that you need to take more risk, right?
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.340]   Most target date funds cap out at 90% equity exposure.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.540]   I looked, if you went up to 2070,
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.220]   I think is the furthest Vanguard one,
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.420]   it's still 90% stocks.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.540]   So I think that's as high as they go.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.180]   So if you want to be 100% invested in stocks,
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.060]   then a target date fund is not for you.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.080]   I'm a big proponent of them.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.920]   You mentioned it, Duncan.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.740]   They're low cost.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.780]   They're probably diversified.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.260]   They're rebalanced automatically.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.100]   They're simple.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.500]   It's like a single fund of funds.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.820]   And then they're professionally managed.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.180]   So the asset allocation will change
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.820]   and get more conservative as you age.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.720]   If that's a problem for you,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.340]   maybe you need a portfolio that's 100% invested in stocks.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.960]   All of my retirement funds
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.260]   are invested fully in the stock market, 100%, right?
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.660]   I take those RPMs all the way to the top.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.900]   I'm not in the leveraged versions like you
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.860]   on some funds, Duncan.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.980]   But if you have the intestinal fortitude
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.620]   to have 100% of your money in stocks, that's fine.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.380]   And that's the one to compare to, that's fine.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.700]   But even within stocks, I diversify by international
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.740]   and I have different strategies
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.740]   and I have different types of stocks.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.260]   So I still diversify that way.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.140]   So if you want to have everything
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.460]   in the biggest stocks in the US,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.540]   then that's a decent benchmark.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.700]   I think, I just think for most people,
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.980]   that's not the benchmark that they have.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.380]   And I think a lot of times my worry is this person
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.020]   is talking about performance chasing, right?
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.620]   The perfect portfolio is pretty clear in hindsight.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.820]   It's never clear ahead of time, right?
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.300]   So diversification means your portfolio
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.300]   is never gonna be invested
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.700]   in the best performing asset class or strategy or style,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.020]   but that's a feature, not a bug.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.740]   So the question really boils down
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.220]   to how you're benchmarking in the first place.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.480]   I'm not a fan of benchmarking portfolio performance
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.360]   to a benchmark simply because it's doing well
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.260]   or because financial media talks about it
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.340]   or someone else has invested that way.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.780]   Because sometimes a diversified portfolio
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.780]   will be the S&P 500.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.500]   Anything you diversified last year, you did much better.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.460]   Right, if you had some value stocks in your portfolio
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.140]   or high quality stocks or something else,
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.020]   international stocks, you did better than the S&P last year.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.980]   So nothing works always and forever.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.820]   I think you just have to figure out
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.540]   if that's the right benchmark for you.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.380]   I look at it like this.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.020]   The only benchmark you should really care about
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.260]   is whether or not you're on track
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.100]   to achieve your financial goals.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.060]   That's it.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.660]   Any performance numbers or risk measured
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.800]   should be compared to that goalpost alone.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.220]   If you're trying to beat the market
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.380]   and you're a stock picker, sure, benchmarks matter.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.220]   But I think it matters what your risk profile
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.100]   and time horizon are.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.980]   And if you set an asset allocation, that's your target.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.220]   And I actually think it's kind of funny.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.580]   I actually think a target date fund
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.180]   is a good benchmark to have.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.380]   If you have an 80/20 allocation to stocks and bonds
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.060]   and you measure that against an 80/20 target date fund,
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.700]   I think that that's actually a pretty good benchmark.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.100]   That's a better benchmark than the S&P 500.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.460]   I also think, I also just think the idea
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.660]   of constantly measuring yourself
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.820]   against those kind of indexes
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.960]   means you're always gonna be chasing something else.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.860]   'Cause it could be the NASDAQ 100 one year,
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.220]   it could be international stocks one year,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.560]   it could be bonds one year, you never know.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.100]   I also, I just, the whole thing about beating the market
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.940]   is always kind of funny to me.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.020]   Jason Zweig wrote a piece
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.140]   for the Wall Street Journal a number of years ago
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.080]   about beating the market.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.920]   And I love this part.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.220]   He said, I'm gonna read it here.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.460]   "I once interviewed dozens of residents in Boca Raton,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.700]   "one of Florida's richest retirement communities.

[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.620]   "'All I know is my investments earn enough
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.180]   "'for me to end up in Boca.'"
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.020]   I think that's the idea.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.180]   You don't judge your performance against the stock market
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.580]   or whatever you think it is.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.820]   You judge it against whatever asset allocation fits for you
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.820]   and your personality and your disposition.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.580]   And that asset allocation should always be tied
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.820]   to your risk profile and time horizon.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.860]   That's the thing.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.980]   I think first you figure out
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.900]   if that's the right asset allocation for you.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.140]   And then you figure out what the right benchmark is
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.140]   to judge yourself against.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.540]   - Yeah, it kind of becomes a keeping up
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.780]   with the Joneses thing, right?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.740]   It's exhausting to constantly be judging yourself like that.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.700]   - So your benchmark is TQQQ, right?
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.580]   - Yeah, I mean, hey, I actually, new experience.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.460]   I started selling covered calls a while back
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.720]   because I was looking for something
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.340]   to help offset my horrible losses.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.180]   - Not that good.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.820]   - And I just got some pulled away from me
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.260]   at a very unfavorable price that I wasn't expecting.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.500]   So I just found another way to get chopped off.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.420]   - But you earned some premium in the meantime, I hope.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.700]   - I did, I did.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.540]   - Okay.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.940]   - Not worth it though, but yeah.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.340]   - Right, that's the kind of strategy
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.780]   that always seems better in a bear market, right?
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.980]   And that's the whole problem here
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.740]   with any of this stuff is anytime there's a bear market,
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.300]   you're gonna be kicking yourself saying,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.860]   "I wish I would have gone into this with way less risk."
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.740]   And when there's a bull market,
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.000]   you're gonna be kicking yourself and going,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.460]   "I wish I would have gone to this with way more risk."
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.100]   Unfortunately, I think for most people,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.340]   you figure out the asset allocation
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.300]   that you can hold during both of those environments
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.780]   and everything in between,
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.780]   and that's the one you have to be,
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.140]   find your, make yourself comfortable with.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.180]   Otherwise, you're always gonna be chasing something.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.020]   - Right, and the way I make myself comfortable
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.440]   with something like that scenario,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.180]   just described as, like Josh says,
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.780]   it's like your tuition to the market, right?
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.920]   You know, like I didn't go to school
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.900]   for finance and investing.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.100]   So, you know, sometimes you pay a little tuition.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.940]   - You went to film school
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.020]   so you could record Michael and I
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.220]   running on a beach in slow motion.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.020]   - Right, exactly.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.820]   - All right, next question.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.940]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Pascal,
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.980]   or Pascal, I'm not sure.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.020]   "Thanks to you, I am now really interested
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.760]   "in personal finance.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.340]   "I have money to invest in a low-cost index fund,
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.700]   "but I have serious doubts that the market can generate
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.620]   "around 8% returns over the next few decades.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.640]   "We can't replicate the industrial revolution
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.560]   "of the last century, and the climate crisis
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.500]   "will have a massive impact on the world economy.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.660]   "World population growth slowing is a mega trend,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.580]   "and future generations cannot sustain
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.360]   "the pace of growth we witnessed in the last century.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.660]   "In general, the earth is a finite system,
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.740]   "so indefinite growth is impossible.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.160]   "Isn't this a mathematical reality?"
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.980]   - So this was the TLDR, this one,
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.620]   Pascal is actually from Germany, I guess,
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.820]   and he gave like eight more paragraphs,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.820]   so I actually read 'em all,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.040]   and kind of went bullet point by bullet point
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.100]   going through this.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.340]   I understand the thinking here,
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.540]   even if I don't agree with it.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.420]   Like, is there a ceiling of the amount we can grow?
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.140]   I guess eventually, like the United States
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.100]   was once an emerging market,
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.940]   so the fact that we've grown so much in the last,
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.060]   whatever, 150, 200 years,
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.260]   can we grow that much going forward?
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.940]   No, just like China has had 10% growth
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.500]   for the last 30 to 40 years or whatever,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.560]   they can't do that forever.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.740]   So I think the low-hanging fruit has probably been picked
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.820]   in terms of growth and innovation, sure.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.820]   But I still think we have some work to do.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.060]   John, give me a chart on here.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.780]   This is from Our World in Data.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.440]   Shows the share of the population living in poverty.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.580]   25% of the world still lives on less than $3.65 a day.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.560]   47% of the world lives on less than $6.85 a day.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.420]   84% of the world lives on less than $30 per day,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.320]   which is the poverty line
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.800]   reflective of like high-income countries.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.220]   So there's still plenty of work to do
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.500]   and plenty of emerging markets
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.100]   that I think are gonna come up and have their day
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.460]   and can provide some growth,
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.620]   even if it doesn't come from the US.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.060]   But I don't know.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.900]   Do I think people are gonna wake up in the decades ahead
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.360]   and not want to improve their standing in life?
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.200]   No.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.620]   Do I think innovation is gonna plateau
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.820]   and stop happening from here?
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.500]   No, I think it's probably only gonna get better.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.460]   Do I think people are gonna stop
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.080]   spending money in the future?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.920]   I think, if anything,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.860]   we've shown that that's probably never gonna happen
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.340]   for the United States.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.580]   And do I also think corporations
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.860]   are gonna try to stop creating profits?
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.700]   No.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.220]   What drives stock market returns over the long run?
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.420]   Profits and dividends.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.660]   So could returns be lower in the future?
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.020]   You could certainly make that case.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.620]   But does that necessarily mean
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.120]   that everything's gonna grind to a halt
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.180]   and things are gonna stop?
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.780]   I think if that's the bet you're making,
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.820]   that growth is gonna stop completely
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.060]   because we've already rung everything,
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.620]   all the water out of it that we can.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.940]   I think the least of your worries in that situation
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.380]   is your stock market portfolio.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.340]   'Cause it's not gonna matter
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.620]   what you do with your money at all.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.640]   If the economy just completely stops
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.460]   and the gears grind to a halt,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.460]   then your investments aren't gonna matter anyway
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.340]   because we're probably gonna have hyperinflation
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.220]   or something and things will go really wrong.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.520]   Now, on the climate change front,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.340]   like a lot of people are worried about that,
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.000]   but I mean, can you imagine the amount of government
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.500]   and private spending that might be necessary
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.540]   to combat climate change in the future?
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.420]   Electric vehicles and charging stations
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.120]   and wind and solar and batteries.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.220]   I actually think that's kind of bullish
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.320]   for the stock market because we're gonna have to--
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.160]   - I agree.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.540]   This is one of the areas I'm most interested in.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.180]   I'm constantly reading about battery storage
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.940]   and electrifying the grid
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.500]   and moving away from fossil fuels and that kind of thing.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.180]   Yeah, I see it as something that could actually
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.300]   turn a negative into a positive from an economic standpoint.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.780]   - Yeah, I think it could be more government spending
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.460]   and I think that could actually be helpful.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.200]   I think, like what's the higher probability bet here?
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.980]   Like is there a non-zero chance
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.580]   that stock market returns are awful going forward?
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.300]   Of course, that's always a possibility,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.080]   but do you really want to bet your future on that,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.920]   your kid's future?
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.640]   Like I think stock market returns
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.340]   being pretty decent or terrible,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.740]   the baseline for me is stock returns
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.580]   are gonna be pretty decent.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.620]   I wouldn't have terrible as my baseline
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.100]   because it's kind of like if you make that bet,
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.540]   what good is it gonna do anyway?
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.860]   You're screwed either way.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.580]   So you might as well bet that stock market returns
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.280]   are gonna be okay going forward.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.580]   Maybe they won't be as great as they were,
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.880]   but betting that they're okay, I think is,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.060]   otherwise, what's the point?
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.660]   Just spend everything you own now.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.540]   - Yeah, thinking about like don't look up style scenario,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.100]   what's the alternative if you're like,
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.900]   yeah, humans won't be able to inhabit the earth in 50 years?
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.740]   Well then, I mean, what are you gonna do anyway then?
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.580]   So to me, I like to be optimistic about it
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.140]   and think that we're gonna harness technology,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.780]   we're gonna innovate, we're gonna find ways.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.300]   Everyone's gonna care more and more, right?
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.140]   As things start to become more and more obvious
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.100]   about the climate and the future.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.360]   And I don't think it'll be as politicized in the future,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.200]   that kind of thing.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.640]   So yeah, I'm hopeful.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.080]   - And do we kick the can down the road
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.000]   and wait to the last minute
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.680]   to solve these kinds of things?
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.520]   Probably.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.360]   - We love procrastination.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.960]   - Yeah, but then we're just gonna spend a ton of money
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.640]   and get a really crazy bull market in a year,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   and then we're gonna have a crash and another bull market,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.440]   and so goes life.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.560]   - Yep, or we'll move to Mars.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.880]   - There you go.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.360]   All right, another question.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.880]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Justin.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.760]   Hello, I'm a regular watcher of the show and other content.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   I really enjoy all, I really enjoy you all,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.680]   and find you entertaining and educational.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.720]   Thanks, Justin.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.960]   That being said, uh-oh.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   I'm confused why you continually push Roth IRAs.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.800]   Why do you and Bill want everyone to pay taxes up front
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.960]   and to avoid them later?
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.200]   Or yeah, to avoid them later.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.560]   The idea of low earning years early
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.240]   and higher later is nonsense.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   Isn't the goal to live off the proceeds of your investments
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.160]   and leave the principal alone?
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.520]   Is your 75% principal going to outpace my 100%?
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.500]   When you die, you'll have paid taxes
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.080]   and pass on substantially less.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.480]   When I die, my family will pay no taxes.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.800]   Wealthy people go out of their way to avoid taxes.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.200]   Why are you recommending people pay them up front?
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.160]   Shots fired.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.040]   - Justin went hard in the paint here on the Roths.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.520]   All right, let's get Bill Sweet in here to defend his honor
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.120]   because Justin went hard in the paint on the Roth.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.080]   - Ooh, wow.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.120]   - That's rough, Bill.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.960]   - Yeah, I had to take the jacket off
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.240]   'cause it's heating up a little bit in here.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.760]   Justin, my man.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.360]   - Now, Bill, as much as you love the Roth
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.440]   as a tax-deferred vehicle,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.000]   you have stated in the past on many occasions
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.380]   that it's not right for every circumstance.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.320]   So before we, Justin laid out a lot.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.720]   He laid his case out here pretty,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.560]   I mean, this is like Stephen A. Smith style here.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.040]   Before we get into anything you disagree with here,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   anything that he said here that you actually agree with
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.840]   that makes sense.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.600]   - Yeah, well, first off, Justin,
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.880]   if you come at the king, you best not miss.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.280]   But I do agree, Ben, with Justin.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.220]   He's got a bunch of great points.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.200]   And Ben, we covered this on the last Ask the Compound
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.880]   two weeks ago, as you recall,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.560]   where I did moderate my stance a little bit
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.220]   on the Roth IRAs due to some listener feedback like this.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.480]   But Justin, guns blazing, I give you a lot of credit.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.520]   He's got a lot of great points.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.560]   I do think I've overstated the benefits of Roth IRAs.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.280]   They're not applicable in all circumstances
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.500]   to all taxpayers.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.640]   If you're in a high-income situation now
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.780]   and you expect to be a low-income situation in retirement,
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.080]   Roth ain't for you.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.000]   That's what traditional IRAs and 401ks are for.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.520]   And when choosing between Roth and traditional,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.000]   I advocate that there's no reason to do both,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.160]   to do one or the other.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.600]   Like that is a fallacy.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.060]   And so, John, can we just pull up the first chart real quick?
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.560]   This is a chart I shared two shows ago,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.740]   two Ask the Compounds.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.600]   If you're in the 12% bracket or less,
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.040]   Roth makes all the sense in the world.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.640]   If you're at 32% or above,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.640]   generally depending on path dependence,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.380]   I would say thou shalt not Roth.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.220]   And that's it.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.000]   I think that's it, not applicable for everybody.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.960]   John, can we take the chart away?
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.000]   - The simple one would be,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.680]   your younger, low-earning years,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.200]   Roth makes a ton of sense.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.600]   Older, higher-earning years,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.840]   Roth doesn't make as much sense.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.680]   Is that fair?
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.500]   - Yeah, more or less.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.480]   And I think the 12% tax bracket is more or less it,
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.560]   that right around there, it tends to be a slam dunk,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.480]   unless you expect to be indigent in retirement
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.720]   without Social Security, without RMDs.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.640]   So, Ben, if you will indulge me,
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.280]   can I get to some points, some retorts for a moment here?
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.760]   - The floor is yours because, yeah, I figured.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.280]   So, Justin, a couple of things.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.520]   First off, in your presumptions that you're not gonna,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.800]   your heirs aren't gonna pay any tax, that's not right.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.020]   Like, if your heirs inherit your traditional 401(k) IRA,
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.840]   they have to distribute the balance within 10 years,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.560]   and that's 100% taxable to them.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.660]   And so, if you don't care about your heirs paying tax,
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.720]   I mean, I just, I wouldn't do that,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.600]   but there's no step-up in basis
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.920]   that occurs with a traditional asset.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.040]   So, that's a big one.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.520]   Another point that I wanna just debate a little bit,
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.800]   behavioral finance shows,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.200]   this is a Harvard University paper,
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.560]   does front-loading taxation increase savings from 2015?
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.160]   It shows that when given the option,
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.280]   people save the same amount in a Roth 401(k)
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.020]   as they do in a traditional 401(k).
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.860]   - I was thinking that.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.780]   So, he was saying your 75% principal versus my 100%.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.540]   Most people who do that don't then save the difference.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.920]   - That's it, that's exactly it.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   And so, if you're choosing between Roth or traditional,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.840]   and you have the discipline to go out and save
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.780]   the balance that you would have otherwise invested,
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.140]   then yes, I think it's close,
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.600]   and in many cases, the traditional 401(k) wins out.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.360]   But, where we live in the real world,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.220]   with real people that don't do this,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.720]   don't know there's life on a spreadsheet,
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.880]   they tend to save the same amount,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.300]   and so, when you look back in hindsight,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.240]   when you get to retirement and distribution age,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.100]   if you have a traditional and Roth IRA,
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.320]   your Roth IRA is worth about 20 or 30% more
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.980]   because it's all post-tax, right?
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.840]   - I did this recently.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.400]   When I switched to a Roth 401(k) a few years ago,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.200]   I saved the exact same amount.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.040]   - Exactly.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.240]   - I didn't change what I saved.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.640]   - And so, exactly your point, Ben,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.680]   if you're cramming more dollars into the Roth
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.520]   that are post-tax,
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.540]   it ends up being worth more in retirement,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.280]   assuming that you don't save the difference,
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.020]   and that's the key point.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.100]   Next is, I'm not optimizing personally for my net worth.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.020]   That is a heresy in financial planning,
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.500]   where people play this video game
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.820]   where they wanna see their net worth go up every year.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.180]   I don't give a flying hoot.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.940]   I am optimizing in my retirement
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.500]   for how much money can I spend,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.580]   and therefore, I am very comfortable,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.540]   early in my life, in early years,
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.140]   filling up those low tax brackets,
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.540]   stuffing the Roth into there,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.800]   because when I get to retirement,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.080]   I'm gonna get to take all those distributions tax-free
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.460]   and live happy, and buy my cars,
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.520]   and go on vacations, and have a good time.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.660]   So that is very important.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.340]   In my experience in financial planning work,
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.340]   15, 16 years of experience,
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.680]   retirees taking distributions
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   still feel the pain of taxable distributions.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.180]   It is still painful for them,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.220]   especially lump-sum distributions,
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.740]   which, assuming you have Social Security,
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.880]   assuming you have, let's say, a modest pension,
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.640]   assuming you have some investment income,
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.380]   you're probably not gonna be in the 12% bracket.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.380]   - Oh, so you think people have a way easier time
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.580]   spending Roth dollars?
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.300]   - Yes, and that has been my experience,
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.620]   and we're gonna get to that question, Ben,
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.540]   another listening question here in a moment,
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.780]   but if you're pushing into a higher tax bracket,
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.160]   then you may blow up the math,
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.720]   and furthermore, it doesn't account
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.280]   for things like Medicare surcharges,
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.560]   which begin to kick in at about $140,000, $160,000
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.920]   of net income, and so that's a big deal.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.520]   So I'm not optimizing for net worth,
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.720]   I'm playing a different game, and that's okay, right?
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.680]   So for people that wanna see their net worth
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.720]   go up every year, Roth errors are not for you.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.400]   You will definitely be better served
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.540]   with a traditional pre-tax dollar.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.840]   And then, again, I just recommend
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.040]   filling up less tax brackets.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.640]   Last point, John, can we go to chart number two?
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.680]   So I'm gonna reveal some of my bias,
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.760]   but without any bias or anything like this,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.040]   I wanna show you guys a chart of,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.160]   this is federal government expenditures
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.440]   on the top line, and receipts on the blue line.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.640]   And those numbers have not been in balance
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.720]   since roughly the late '90s.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.920]   And that's okay, because, Ben, you've said this before,
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.720]   and I agree, the government is not a household,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.320]   it doesn't have to balance the books,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   but when I look at these numbers, they are disconnected,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.200]   and one of the primary reasons is, John,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.040]   this next chart that I wanna show the listeners,
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.140]   this is a history of federal tax brackets,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.640]   effective tax rates, not the highest marginal rate.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.200]   My opinion and my bias is,
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.120]   we're living in a low-tax nirvana right now,
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.460]   and we just don't realize it.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.040]   I have no expectation that tax rates are gonna jump up
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.240]   in the next couple of years, but I don't have to,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.960]   because absent action by Congress,
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.520]   every taxpayer's gonna be paying about 3% more in 2026
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.240]   because of the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.920]   And so that's a bias of mine,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.440]   that's an assumption that's built in,
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.820]   but I do think that we're living
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.340]   in this low-tax environment right now,
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.800]   and we just don't realize it.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.660]   - That's why I noted that I was gonna ask you, Bill,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.260]   'cause a lot of people I feel like always assume
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:58.140]   that we know that tax rates are gonna be XYZ in the future,
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.260]   20, 30, 40, 50 years, but I mean,
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.700]   there's nothing really stopping massive increases
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.940]   in taxes down the road, right?
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.960]   - I think that's correct, and that's a scare tactic,
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.020]   but if you look across the world
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   and look at other OECD, the major countries,
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.520]   the U.S. is in the bottom third of taxes.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.100]   I think there's a conservative argument
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.220]   that that's part of what makes our economy dynamic, right?
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.980]   People are out there reinvesting that capital elsewhere,
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.900]   but the government spending is just so outpaced revenues,
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.820]   and there's not a political will to increase taxes.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.780]   I do not think spending is gonna go down,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.380]   so I think just by hook or crook,
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.580]   this is gonna have to work itself up one way or the other,
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.020]   and I think higher taxes are in our future.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.820]   - Sean in the chat wants to know
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.780]   if you actually drew that last graph on Etch-a-Sketch.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.860]   - I didn't, but it might've been a big improvement.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.740]   That's actually, I wanna shout out a guy, Mike Bostic.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.460]   I read that article a couple years ago.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.060]   It's a really, really good article on observable.com.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.800]   - But yeah, to the point of not knowing
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.640]   what the future holds,
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.220]   that's the whole point of tax diversification
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.580]   and why I preach the benefits of diversification
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.620]   in everything that you do.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.660]   I think income diversification is helpful.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.460]   Investment diversification, tax diversification,
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.860]   all this stuff, I think you rarely ever
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.460]   wanna be concentrated in one thing
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.860]   because you're betting on the future's
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.680]   gonna turn out this way,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.020]   so I'm gonna concentrate anything I do in one bucket.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.860]   - Yep, and we had a great listener question last week, Ben,
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.540]   that we addressed two weeks ago on Asset Compound.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.500]   Please go back and take a look,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.340]   but it was should I ever have 100% Roth,
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.180]   and my answer's no.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.400]   You should not always leverage,
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.840]   unless you're 25 years old
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.060]   and you plan to shift to traditional later.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.640]   I'm probably about a year or two out,
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.600]   and I'm gonna shift gears,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.720]   but probably, Ben, the last point on this for me,
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.520]   I've been 100% Roth since I got into this game,
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.160]   and I'm 43 years old,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.720]   and I'm probably mid-career right now,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.400]   so I can't say more about what I'm doing with my own assets
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.080]   and what I help clients recommend with than that.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.300]   - Right.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.520]   - So great question, Justin, thanks for the question.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.360]   I appreciate it.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.880]   - No, we don't mind a little pushback here, right?
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.700]   - Bring it on.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.540]   - Bring it on.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.380]   - Bring it on. - Yeah, that's fun.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.160]   - Yeah, there's nothing like Bill spitting facts
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.240]   with a tank shell over his shoulder there.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.000]   - Exactly, that is an M82 high-explosive anti-tank round.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.200]   It's not real, just to be very clear.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.640]   Don't come and arrest me.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.800]   But I bring the heat.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.960]   I bring the heat, too.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.800]   - I like it.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.840]   Okay, up next, we have our first ever audio question
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.840]   submitted, and it's a really good one,
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.760]   and it's from Joshua, and he really took time.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.980]   He got it perfect.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.260]   It's a very good recording.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.100]   - Let's do it.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.920]   - So I'm gonna hit play on this thing.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.760]   Let's listen.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.360]   - I have a question about HSAs.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.600]   I know Ben isn't fully sold out
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.320]   on the health savings account,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.080]   but we're fairly keen on the triple tax advantage.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.280]   We opened our account in 2006
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.400]   and have fully funded it every year since.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.000]   We paid for one set of braces,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.080]   but paid all other medical bills out of pocket.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.520]   With the long-term in mind, we invested in 90% equities,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.920]   low-cost index funds, but alas,
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.440]   no target date funds were available.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.800]   It's been a good 17 years for stocks,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.200]   and not to brag, it's $250,000 now.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.420]   The question is this.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.240]   How much is too much in an HSA?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.360]   We're millennial empty nesters.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.280]   Barely 40, one child in college.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.920]   House is paid for, college is all sorted,
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.160]   retirement is on track.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.940]   My wife has a long-term chronic health condition,
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.440]   so healthcare is super important to us,
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   but if we keep funding the HSA at the annual maximum,
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.320]   it'll just grow.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.560]   We know it can be used as a pre-tax account after 65,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.060]   and we've heard the inheritance situation is pretty rotten,
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.240]   but we just struggle to turn away
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.800]   from the triple tax advantage.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.100]   Do we keep on funding it,
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.240]   or find something else to do with these funds?
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.880]   Thank you.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.200]   - Bravo, Joshua, great question.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.760]   Very eloquent reading skills, way better than I could do.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.320]   The recording quality was perfect.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.080]   Yeah, he did sound very, maybe he can--
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.920]   - Eloquent.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.280]   - He can do my next audio book for me, I think.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.800]   - Yeah, this is good.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.320]   - Let's see, so first of all, I'm not anti-HSA.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.980]   I honestly just don't have the bandwidth for another account
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.640]   because I have 401ks and IRAs and SEP IRAs
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   and corporate accounts and 529s.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.080]   It's not the HSA's fault.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.040]   So having said that, I know very many smart people
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.480]   who swear by the triple tax benefit.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.880]   Blair Duquene has been on this show before.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.280]   She's talked about the benefits of the HSA.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.000]   - Joey Fishman, our guy in Portland.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.680]   - Yeah, love the HSA.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.560]   Bill, what say you?
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.600]   First, how much is too much?
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.280]   'Cause they have a big amount in there.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.120]   Is that ever a problem if it's overfunded?
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.640]   Is there problems down the road from that?
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.800]   - Yeah, wow, Josh, I don't know that I've ever seen
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.320]   an HSA of that magnitude.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.880]   I have seen six figures, but not 250K.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.080]   So that is some fantastic investing.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.400]   And one of the things I don't like about HSAs sometimes
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.240]   are higher fees.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.520]   So I'm presuming that you've just got a great, great deal
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.840]   and a lot of discipline between you
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.520]   and your wife and your family.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.000]   For me, Ben, the only thing better than a Roth IRA,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.440]   in my opinion, is that HSA
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.260]   because of the triple tax exemption that Josh mentioned.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.080]   It's such a powerful savings vehicle,
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.020]   and it's very rare to see any amounts of this magnitude.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.280]   So how much is too much in the context
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.480]   of somebody's net worth?
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.040]   Really hard to answer, but Josh, I think,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.000]   hit on something towards the end of his question
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.040]   that to me was so important,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.800]   that if you've got some chronic health issues going on,
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.400]   like, that's what those assets are going to be used for.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.000]   And ultimately, as we age,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.400]   and we do this in financial planning a lot,
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.960]   people really tend to underestimate
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.000]   their medical spending, right?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.200]   And a lot of times when we do these mining card simulations
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.240]   going forward, what tends to happen is people age,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.480]   their medical needs increase,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.120]   and that ends up being a quality of life thing, typically,
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.740]   or a quantity of life.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.840]   But ultimately, my guess is those assets
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.880]   are just doing exactly what they need to do.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.080]   I would have no qualms dumping in another $6,000 a year
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.360]   into a balance of 250K with the plan of being
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.680]   the distribution of the future.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.200]   And Ben, I want to mention before we close
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.560]   that the coolest thing about HSA
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.600]   is that the year of distribution
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.640]   does not have to match the year of the expenses incurred.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.080]   And so if you incur a $10,000 medical bill, unfortunately,
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.000]   or brace, as you mentioned, in a single year,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.280]   you can hold on to that reimbursement from the HSA
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.800]   for five years, for 10 years,
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.960]   allowing that compound effect to occur.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.280]   So that to me, it's like,
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.680]   I don't know that an HSA balance could be too large
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.120]   for me to be concerned about it
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   due to all the factors that Josh laid out.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.800]   - Right, this fact that they already know at 40
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.560]   his wife has a chronic health.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.080]   - Yes, very sure to hear that, yeah.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.680]   - Yeah, this is a huge fallback plan for them.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.240]   This is like a big time margin of safety.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.640]   I also want to talk about how they're 40
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.320]   and kid is already in college.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.400]   - Yeah, wow, what's that all about?
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.800]   - Started young, that's, I had a friend from who,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.820]   him and his wife got pregnant like the summer
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.720]   after our high school senior year.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.600]   - Okay.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.160]   - And their kids are out of the house already.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.640]   It's like a total backwards,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.680]   and they're reliving their youth.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.240]   So hopefully that the Joshua, or this is a,
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.200]   who's this one?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.360]   Is this another Josh? - That's Josh.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.200]   Yeah, that's Josh.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.400]   Our guy Josh, yeah, definitely.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.920]   - Can live it up a little bit too.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.580]   And obviously they've saved enough money,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.960]   so they're in pretty good position.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.360]   But I think you're gonna have a lot of flexibility
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.300]   as time goes forward.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.080]   And again, my guess is you are gonna use that.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.160]   But if I'm you, Josh,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.640]   I'm saving every single medical receipt.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.040]   You go to CVS, you pay that $3 copay,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.480]   that's going to a drawer somewhere
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.680]   or put it in a PDF for a future tax return.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.600]   Because you're right, ultimately--
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.640]   - You're gonna need a lot of drawers
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.000]   if you're saving CVS receipts 'cause they're so big.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.880]   'Cause they're this long.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.720]   But yeah, but I'd be stacking those things
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.760]   as high as you can go,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.840]   because ultimately you are gonna wanna access that cash
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.600]   at some point and use it to fund other goals.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.800]   And the best way to do that is to get that money tax-free.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.560]   - Here's a question from the comments.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.520]   Can you use HSAs for nursing care if you need it?
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.360]   - Get me to it.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.700]   I was gonna say something.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.960]   - To the best of my knowledge, yes, I'm not an expert,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.040]   but I'll dig into that.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.080]   And Ben, if you maybe wanna follow up an update next week,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.000]   we can do so.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.240]   But yeah, to the best of my knowledge, yeah,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.080]   it's pretty broad on what HSAs can be used for.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.840]   - Cool, all right.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.120]   Great, great audio.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:32.960]   Everyone doesn't have to do that,
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.640]   but that was a good first one.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.480]   He broke us a good one.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.560]   - I wanna rap next time, if you can drop a beat.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.120]   - Oh, true, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.400]   Just not licensed music.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.880]   - Next question about Roth IRAs.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.720]   Someone else likes Roth IRAs too.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.560]   - Let's do it.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.620]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Sam.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.800]   I have a question about how to view my Roth IRA
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.320]   now that I'm older than 59 1/2.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.240]   I don't need the money for anything this time,
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.560]   so should I view it as something
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   that should only be used as a last resort,
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.960]   or should I now be okay with using some of the money
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.640]   to pay for things like a vacation or a car,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.280]   or even if I could pay for those things with other money?
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.120]   If the answer is that I should never touch the money
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.520]   unless I absolutely have to,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   it seems like I may never actually get to spend any of it.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.720]   - Okay, we kinda started down this path earlier
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.160]   about is a Roth, and I never thought about that, Bill,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.480]   but you're right.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.020]   We've had countless conversations with clients
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.760]   and with our advisors about the fact
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.240]   that people have an easy time building wealth and saving
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.740]   because they compound slowly and it builds up,
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.360]   but then when they have to turn around the other way,
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.200]   like turn the battleship and spend it,
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.240]   it's very psychologically challenging for people
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.000]   because I don't know how I'm gonna live,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I don't know what my healthcare expenses are gonna be,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.320]   and people have a hard time spending their money.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.640]   So I like the idea of the psychology
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.860]   behind spending Roth dollars.
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.180]   Now Sam here, it sounds like, is going the other way,
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.840]   saying what if I never spend these?
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.960]   So what do you think?
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.380]   How should they view that in terms of spending?
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.880]   - Yeah, I've got two answers for Sam.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.480]   First off, Sam, very strong name.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.240]   It's the name of my firstborn son,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.280]   just doesn't get much better.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.500]   We're gonna talk about Sam Sweet in a couple minutes,
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.720]   but moving forward with Sam, I've got two answers for you.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.880]   Number one is if I have a bucket of Roth,
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.280]   in addition to my traditional IRA,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.120]   in addition to my Social Security,
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.480]   in addition to my pension, et cetera,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.720]   for me, that lends itself
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.920]   to these types of lump sum distributions
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.360]   because what happens is if you right-size your life
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.580]   based on, again, your Social Security, recurring income,
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.740]   let's say your RMDs when you hit age 73,
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.260]   if you right-size your life around those,
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.080]   you're paying your bills,
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.120]   you're paying your gas bill, blah, blah, blah,
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.960]   every once in a while,
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.640]   you're gonna wanna buy a new car.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.460]   Every once in a while, you're gonna want a fancy dinner.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.300]   Every once in a while,
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.320]   you're gonna get on a plane and fly to Paris,
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.740]   wherever you wanna go, Bogota, whatever's up to you.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.000]   For me, those distributions really, really lend themselves
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.960]   to all the Roth IRAs
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.520]   because they don't disrupt your tax picture.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.280]   John, can we pull up chart number one
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.440]   if you still have that thing handy?
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.960]   - That's true, so you can look at the Roth
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.760]   as a bonus spending.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.040]   I wanna take all the whole family,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.080]   the grandkids and my kids on a huge trip to Italy this year.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.400]   We're gonna take it from the Roth
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.600]   because it's bonus money.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.000]   - And kids, we're gonna do it tax-free.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.640]   The taxman doesn't get a piece of that.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.120]   So just looking at the charts,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.560]   you can see where these step-ups are.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.840]   So if you're right-sizing your life,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.880]   let's say hypothetically,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.920]   somewhere at the high end of the 24% bracket,
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.040]   you've got a lot of income, pension, whatever else,
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.400]   you don't wanna jump up in that 32% bracket
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.120]   by taking $100,000 distribution to buy a new truck
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.680]   or a Tesla or whatever it is you want.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.000]   So that perfectly lends itself to a Roth
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.120]   because furthermore, it doesn't mess up with your IRMA,
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.480]   your Medicare expenses on a monthly basis.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.040]   So that's answer number one.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   Answer number two for me is if, if, if,
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.400]   you've got all your needs funded
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.960]   and if you don't need that asset at all,
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.120]   it is a fantastic estate planning,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.080]   pass it on to the next generation asset, right?
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   So I would not,
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.640]   I would not have that at bullet point number one,
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.920]   but assuming that all of your lifestyle needs are cared for
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.400]   and you're taking your kids out to nice dinners,
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.000]   you're enjoying the retirement that you so richly deserve
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.280]   after working and saving for years and decades
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.840]   and doing it all right.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.480]   On the back end, the Roths are great
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.860]   because on your passing,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.240]   the kids have another 10 years to distribute that asset.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.280]   They leave it to another account.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.960]   It comes from them completely tax-free.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.680]   Going back to question number one for Justin,
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.560]   it was a great question.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.880]   Your heirs are going to pay tax
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.440]   on your traditional IRA balance.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.640]   - Does that work like an RMD
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.840]   where you have to take 1/10 every year?
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.400]   - You do not is the way it works
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.000]   for most taxpayers on the Secure Act.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.440]   There's a technicality there, Ben.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.280]   If you're, if you inherit an asset
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.240]   where the person had already been receiving an RMD,
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.400]   you do have to continue those, but not at 1/10.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.960]   It's based on your life expectancy.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   But so really there's just a final RMD at year 10.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.400]   If I inherit an IRA today, 2023,
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.320]   I need to distribute all the balance by December 31st of 2033
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.720]   or I've broken the law.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.520]   - So your children are going to learn
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.000]   to love Roth someday, right?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.840]   They're going to be getting
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.720]   a lot of Roth dollars coming to them.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.440]   - Well, I mean, you would think so.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.340]   If I have an untimely passing, then yes.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.560]   But my goal, Ben, is to spend every freaking dollar
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.000]   that I'm saving here.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.020]   My kids are on their own.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.440]   I'm going to help them pay for college.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.680]   I'm going to get them on a good feed.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.840]   I might help them out with a vehicle or something like that.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.620]   But after that, they're out of the house
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.520]   and they're on their own.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.960]   And they've got to do it the American way, exactly.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.680]   Yeah, I just, I do push back a lot on clients
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.980]   and taxpayers generally.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.640]   This goal of passing money onto the kids,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.540]   it's insane to me.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.560]   Go out and earn your own money.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.820]   Do it the right way.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.160]   I think that's the way to raise children in 2023.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.440]   - It's Shaq that said, that told his kids,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.600]   you know, that's not your money.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.700]   It's my money, right?
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.600]   Famously.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.800]   - Yeah, and if you have a lot of traditional air balance,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.000]   at least 24% of that's the IRS's money.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.560]   So again, back to Justin, great question.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.320]   But yeah, tax-free.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.900]   I want to, if I pass on assets,
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.920]   I'm going to do it through Roth.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   - Perfect, okay.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.760]   - It's beautiful.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.600]   - A lot of Roth stuff as usual.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.640]   I think we've landed in a good spot with a Roth here.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.860]   - Yeah, it was a good, and again,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.760]   Justin, totally support the feedback.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.240]   I've been way overzealous.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.540]   Can I give my man Sam Sweet a shout out?
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.380]   - Yeah. - Let's do it.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.220]   - So speaking of, you know, a gentleman named Sam John,
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.780]   can you pull up that photo?
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.380]   Sam Sweet's kindergarten graduation was today.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.380]   He graduated with about 18 of his buddies.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.700]   I'm just very, very proud of him.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.820]   A quick story, in his preschool graduation a year ago,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.860]   he melted down to a puddle of goo and began crying.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.820]   But what he told me, I said, Sam, what do you want to do?
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.780]   What do you want to do this weekend?
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.720]   I said, Dad, I want to go camping.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.420]   And if you see a bear, I want you to punch him in the heart
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.980]   and then kick him in the privates.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.940]   And then he ran away to play with his friends.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.100]   And I have never been so proud.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.000]   And I just wanted to share that for posterity.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.620]   10, 20 years from now, I'm gonna show this to him.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.740]   - The great thing is, my kids are done
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.700]   with kindergarten this year too.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.620]   We didn't have a graduation.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.140]   I didn't get to go that route.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.900]   But our kids are gonna graduate high school the same year.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.980]   My twins are both moving on to first grade as well.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.980]   - Oh, congratulations, Ben.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.580]   Our teacher tried to pull that crap and we were like, no.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.820]   We're coming in on this day and we're gonna gather
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.900]   and we're gonna celebrate.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.660]   And the kids got candy and it was awesome.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.900]   - Okay. - Congratulations.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.460]   - Participation trophies still.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.100]   - Congratulations, proud dad.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.180]   - All right, way to go. - Awesome.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.020]   - All right.
