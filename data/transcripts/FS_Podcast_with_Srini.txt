[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast. And in this episode, I have
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.780]   a special guest with me, Srini Rao. He is the founder and creator of the Unmistakable
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:18.400]   Creative Podcast that was launched in 2010. And it has over 1,300 episodes. I can't believe
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   it. That's about 10 times what I've got here on Financial Samurai. So, Srini, welcome to
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.360]   the podcast.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.440]   Yeah, thanks for having me. It's kind of fun to do this. I mean, I've known you since like
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.120]   we started the podcast. You're one of the earliest people I ever interviewed.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.560]   No, you're right. I started in 2009. You started doing something in 2009, right?
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.520]   Yeah. I mean, I started my first blog in 2009. Mainly, the irony of it was the reason I started
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.640]   the blog was because I graduated from business school without a job. And, you know, because
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.440]   2009 was a terrible time to get out of any kind of school. And, you know, the job market
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.600]   was terrible. And if you're submitting resumes, you were kind of done. Like, there's no way
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600]   you're going to stand out. So I started a blog, ironically, as a way of standing out
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.000]   of the job market, which, you know, eventually that ended up just kind of becoming the job.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.760]   But there's a lot of precursors that, you know, sort of people don't know about because
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.760]   you like at a certain point, like if you do something well, all the shitty things you
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.920]   did before kind of get hidden and buried. I don't know if you can find them on the internet.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.120]   But the first real blog I started was a website called 100 Reasons You Should Hire Me. And,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.080]   you know, I couldn't come up with 100 reasons why anybody should hire me. So it was like,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.920]   all right, this is because basically what I did was I saw somebody who had a really
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.200]   interesting website, this girl, Jamie Verone. She'd started this website called Twitter
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   Should Hire Me. And that was like hugely successful. She actually knew what the hell she was doing.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   Like she had real branding experience and design experience. I literally just threw
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.920]   up like a bullshit logo. I used to make this logo look like the Google logo with some logo
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.120]   generator. And it was a blog. I mean, I didn't know what I was doing. But I think the value
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.840]   in those... The funny thing is that that project itself, believe it or not, like really actually
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.600]   informed the entire ethos of what I ended up doing because I was like, oh, I just copied
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.800]   what somebody else did. No wonder this didn't work. You know, and that's like the thing
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.440]   I rail against the most because I mean, you know, I've seen it like, you know, in 10 years,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.240]   like you see these people who will take an online course, they'll like go to a podcasting
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.520]   course and they literally try to replicate the exact thing the person who taught the
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.800]   course does. And it's like, no, you know, like you're missing several things. Like the
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.060]   thing that people never get about all this is like there's one gigantic variable that
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.800]   throws off that entire idea. And that's you. Like look in the mirror, you know, like you
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.000]   and I could do the exact same things. And it's like inevitable that we would get wildly
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.640]   different results just because we have different strengths, different personalities. You know,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.880]   like there are certain things like so, you know, I started in 2009, right? Like there
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.040]   are things that you probably have done that are a lot smarter than I did. Like for example,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.600]   your email list is significantly bigger because you know, you were smart about prioritizing
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.680]   the business aspects of it. I was just creating endlessly and I wasn't really thinking about
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.660]   it from that standpoint very well until I got the book deal. You know, like and a lot
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.140]   of whatever I've accomplished has been very accidental and serendipitous, but it's also
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.500]   through a lot of like, you know, trying things and doing things endlessly. So that first
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.680]   project was important, but it was a joke. It was laughable.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.480]   But you pivoted. So you went to Berkeley for undergrad and then you went to Pepperdine
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   for business school. You said you graduated during a difficult time and it costs a lot
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.320]   of money to go to Pepperdine too, right?
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.040]   And how did you decide to go finally all in on podcasting?
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.960]   Well so it's funny. I think that there's this sort of myth, right? Because what you see
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   on the surface is not like the real story because you know, we put like this image for
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.720]   everybody in the internet is playing a character where they admit it or not. Right? Like you
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.520]   have a brand. I mean, you didn't even reveal your real name for the longest time. Like
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.920]   I remember I had no idea what you looked like until I met you in person. You had that like
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.840]   bizarre avatar. Actually you have it on your.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   I still have it.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.800]   Yeah. So the thing is that, you know, like there's certain things about being a public
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.040]   figure where you have to be mindful about how you come across what you showcase. Because
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.400]   like nobody cares about your problems, right? It's not that I don't have problems that
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.320]   I don't have issues. People want you to solve their problems. And at a certain point, as
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.400]   your presence becomes bigger and bigger, there's a sort of fine line you have to toe between
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.880]   what you're, what is for public consumption and what's for not. Now I'll be, you know,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.120]   I'll be transparent with you. Like I still have plenty of debt from business school,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   but going all in for me was accidental because I didn't have much of a choice. Like my job
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.640]   history is pretty checkered. Like I'd been fired from all my jobs. But I mean, when I
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.960]   got out of business school, like I looked at this resume and I was like, wow, the biggest
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   problem with this resume is that it's not tangible evidence of anything I know how to
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   do. It's just a bunch of bullet points and like bullshit. Like I became the master of
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.360]   spinning bullet points and to bullshit. I was really good at job interviews. Like I
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.720]   could go into a job interview and I could charm any interviewer because there was a
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.440]   way to do it. Like I don't remember, I don't remember, uh, vault. It was a website called
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.000]   vault.com. You would, my wife used to internet vault.com in New York. Yeah. Well, you're
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.880]   a finance guy. So you would know this, right? So vault had these guides on how to do interviews.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.520]   And I remember they had this like formula called star. I don't even remember what the
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.760]   hell the acronym stood for. So I memorized that thing and like looked at it so I could
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.720]   go into any job interview and I could impress the hell out of the guy who was interviewing
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.480]   me. But I was always terrible at the job because it was all bullshit. Yeah. So I became like
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.520]   the master bullshit artist. And the problem with that was that eventually it just all
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.280]   caught up with me. So, you know, my job history wasn't impressive by any means. So like for
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.760]   me, this was almost forced upon me. I didn't really feel like I had much of a choice. It
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.520]   was like, okay, I kind of know where it's going to head if I go and find a job. And
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.920]   so the thing is that I also made choices that, you know, like a lot of people don't have
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.800]   the luxury or freedom to make. Like you have a family that changes a lot of things. Um,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.560]   but I was, I was single. I still am. So, you know, I chose to live at home for God knows
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.320]   how long. I mean, you remember this like early days of the podcast and this past year I've
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.760]   been at home mainly out of choice, not out of necessity because my sister had an eight
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.320]   month old. So I came home to spend, you know, that time with him and had so many family
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.120]   events that I was like, all right, my parents like, well, why would you move now? We're
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.800]   going to India for six weeks. I'm like, yeah, you're right. Why would I move now? We've
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.120]   got this, you know, six bedroom household to myself for six weeks. So I'm like, yeah,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.360]   I'll stay here. Um, and it's been great because like I got to travel this year, like I gotta
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.600]   do a lot of things that other people don't get to do, but I also, you know, there's always
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.640]   trade-offs. This is the thing that people don't realize that every decision you make
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.440]   in your life is a trade-off between freedom and security, right? You trade off the, you
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.200]   know, freedom of being single for the security of family, but it also comes with all these
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.520]   other things like, you know, connection and love and, you know, all these things you trade
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.960]   off the, the freedom of not being a parent for the joy that comes with being a parent.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.400]   But guess what? Now you have all these responsibilities. And so there's always this trade-off, like
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.280]   we're always making trade-offs and you have to kind of decide like, what's the trade-off.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.680]   And for me, the trade-off was okay, I'm going to live at home. And this is something that
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.840]   I realized was, you know, yeah, during probably the first three to four years, like my earnings
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.480]   were not increasing, but what was increasing was my earning potential, right? Because you
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.880]   know this, like the way that you become, you know, more like, like, like your cable, your
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.120]   earning potential goes up, it's not linear. So you'll spend years doing all this stuff
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.240]   that basically seems like it's going nowhere. Then, you know, you get a book deal and before
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.160]   you know it, you're like, wait a minute, I just made $10,000 in one hour for getting
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.560]   on a stage and talking, you know? And if you think about that versus before, I didn't make
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.080]   that in three months at a day job, you know? Like, so that over time it increases. So,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.400]   you know, going all in was kind of accidental, but then, you know, bit by bit, I was really
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.880]   fortunate in that I had an amazing mentor named Greg who really kind of took me under
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   his wing. Then we raised a round of money in 2018, I think, from Podfund. They had started
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.600]   a venture fund for podcasts. So, I mean, it's had its ups and downs, man. Like the thing
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.880]   about, you know, Unmistakable that's kind of weird, we're this anomaly in that we started
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.280]   long before everybody else, but our audience is smaller and we grew slower. But what we
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.840]   do have are loyal and raving fans. You've seen our iTunes reviews. Like, I think it
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.640]   was like a thousand five-star reviews and none of those were people we coerced into
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.320]   giving us reviews, or like participated in, you know, review exchanges or any of that
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.240]   bullshit. Like those were all legitimately earned. And then there are a few, you know,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.280]   handful of like reviews of people that hate us and I'm like, great, then unsubscribe.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.400]   That's just the way it is. Yeah, dude, you just wrote a, you know, I'm sure like anybody
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.840]   who's ever written a book that reaches a lot of people, they learn pretty fast that it's
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.960]   a really bad idea to look at your reviews. Like there's nothing that will trigger your
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.160]   insecurities more.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.840]   Well, I think you just have to manage expectations when you're a creative, you put yourself out
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:33.720]   there. Try not to take things too personally. Just accept that maybe 10 to up to 20% of
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   your reviews will be bad. That's just the way it is.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.600]   Well, the thing is the more people you reach, the more likely you are to reach somebody
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   that you hate.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   Right. Or that hate you.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.200]   Yeah, exactly. So go look at Mark Manson's book, right? The Subtle Art of Not Giving
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.480]   a Fuckin' Go look at the one star reviews. I mean, that book sold what, like 20 million
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.600]   copies? Of course, there are going to be one star reviews.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Right.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.960]   You know, it's like some religious person might be like, oh, I hate this book because
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.640]   he used the F word in the title, which has nothing. And often you look at the reviews,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.200]   they have nothing to do with the actual content.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Or like Amazon's packaging.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.680]   Yeah, people will be like, oh, this thing didn't show up on time. I'm like, what does
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.920]   that have to do with the product? Nothing.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   You know?
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.600]   And so as a creative, you know, we put our heart and soul into the things we believe
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.560]   in and then we want people to listen. We want people to read. And it's just so sensitive.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.560]   And then when we get smacked down, it's like, oh, man, why'd you got to smack me down?
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.360]   And then some people just quit.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.960]   So here's the thing that I realized about feedback, right? Is you've got to be really
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.680]   mindful about whose feedback counts. And this is the other thing. I mean, like even when
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.400]   I was at the beginning of this, right? Like I get people in my family questioning my sanity.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.360]   Like I had a cousin who told another cousin of mine that, you know, what I was doing was
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.280]   a waste of my education. And then the day that, you know, my book came out, that same
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.880]   person who said that congratulated me on my book launch. And I told my mom, the joke is
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.080]   like, this person is off the wedding for, you know, like my wedding invite list for
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   the wedding that hasn't even been planned yet.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.440]   But the thing is, like what I realized from that is that you have to think about, you
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.880]   know, when you think about these critics, it's like, OK, who's going to live with the
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.560]   consequences of your choices? Them or you?
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.840]   So and you know what? All creative work involves risk. Like there's always a risk that somebody's
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.480]   going to hate it, whatever it is. I like the Seth Godin attitude of this might not work
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.400]   because then you kind of go in sort of detached to the outcome and you focus on the thing
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.160]   you can control, which is the process.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.020]   And that I think is really where a lot of creatives get derailed. They put so much sort
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.920]   of value and attachment to, OK, how are people going to respond? Like all these things that
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.280]   you have absolutely no control over. You know, like when we rebranded, for example, we thought
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.400]   we were out of our minds. They're like, why would you change the name?
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.080]   Blogcast FM, it's such a good name. Can you imagine? We would be obsolete today if that
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.360]   that we had to listen to that advice. And we you know, we didn't even bother to serve
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.240]   in the audience about changing the name. We're like, we're just going to do it like, you
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.520]   know, because one issue we were running into, we said if you go back and look at early reviews,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.720]   there are a lot of people would say this show is not actually just about blogs.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.320]   It's about a lot more. But a lot of them wouldn't tell their friends simply because of the name.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.520]   They're like, my friends won't listen to this because they're not interested in blogging.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.480]   And so we looked for sort of the anomalies and the outliers instead of looking at the
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.680]   masses to determine what we should do.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:12.920]   Got it. You know, what I hear from you after graduating is that you kind of fell into this
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:20.240]   and you kind of had no other choice. But to produce thirteen hundred episodes over a 13
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.220]   year period is quite impressive. So how do you how do you keep on going? What was your
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.220]   driving factor?
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.060]   Well, there are a couple of things. Right. So let's look at this from sort of I'm not
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.580]   going to give you the sort of inspirational bullshit answer. I'm going to give you the
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.540]   straight up behavioral science answer. So the thing is that, you know, the greatest
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.700]   source of motivation for all of us is visible progress. Right. So and this is based on the
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.260]   work of Teresa Amabile, who's a professor at Harvard who wrote a book called The Progress
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.660]   Principle. And so this is why if you look at sort of that whole don't break the chain
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.020]   method, people who put those calendars up stick to workout habits, you know, savings
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.740]   habits or whatever it is, because when you start to see yourself making progress, you
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.260]   are motivated to keep going.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.060]   You know, like if you see that chain, it's like, oh, OK, I actually have maintained 30
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.060]   workout days. Like, well, now I'm motivated just because you don't want to. You're so
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.160]   motivated by what you see in front of you. The problem is that people measure progress
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.660]   with outcomes they can't control. And that's where they get into trouble. Right. So because
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.180]   I remember some podcasts are asking me about this. He was like, you know, probably 50 episodes
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.380]   in. And I'm like, OK, well, you could measure this in one of two ways. You could say, OK,
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.860]   how many people are listening to this thing which you have absolutely no control over?
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.140]   Or you could say how many times how many episodes have I created? And so the other thing that
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.620]   happens is when you have progress, progress leads to momentum and momentum increases motivation.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.140]   So you basically just get into this sort of virtuous cycle. Yeah. That basically eventually
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.780]   hits sort of escape velocity. Right. Because if you go back and look at a lot of the bloggers
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.780]   who started when we did, you'll see these inflection points that happen for people like
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.340]   you and I, where it was like, boom, boom, boom.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.460]   We're just like consistently, consistently, consistently nothing special. Like it wasn't
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.820]   like you were, you know, Wall Street Journal bestselling author or whatever it is. I mean,
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.740]   look, you got your book deal two years ago. And I remember when you said to me, oh, wow,
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.380]   that's cool. And if you think about it, the same thing kind of happened to me. Right.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:18.300]   It was like 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. In 2013, people call that, you know,
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.340]   it's like overnight. Trini came out of nowhere and had this self-published book that became
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.500]   a Wall Street Journal bestseller. But what they forget is like, by the way, there are
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.220]   a thousand blog posts that came before that. And even after that, before I even got a book
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.860]   deal, like I didn't get a book deal for two years after my Wall Street Journal bestseller.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.620]   Like that didn't attract the attention of any publishers until probably February 2015.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.700]   Yeah. Why is that, you think? Well, OK, so self-publishing is kind of weird.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.420]   One thing, if you self-publish a book, you can't be on the New York Times bestseller
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.940]   list. Because remember, I told you the week your book launched, I was like, hammer your
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.060]   email list. I don't care if you get subscribers. Like I remember that. I remember you sending
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.900]   me an email. I'm like, all right, dude, send one last email. Don't you think that's a little
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.740]   too much? I was like, don't you want to hit the Wall Street Journal bestseller list was
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.100]   my response. And you did. So you can thank me for that. You're going to send me half
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.420]   your advance on the next book. OK, sounds good.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:13.380]   So the thing is that but the thing is, you get to a certain point where you hit momentum.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:19.220]   And so my mentor, Greg Hartle, taught me about this concept called a momentum window. And
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.540]   this is something that if you play your cards right, like you just did it. And what you've
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.380]   just experienced in the last year and a half is probably a fantastic example of this. Right.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.260]   So the thing is that when you hit a momentum window, if you play your cards right, like
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.540]   think Mark Zuckerberg at 100,000 Facebook users, right? He's no longer dealing with
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.820]   the problem of, you know, hey, you know, like we're having issues with servers in our dorm
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.500]   room or whatever it is. From that point forward, he's in a momentum window. And if he plays
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.540]   his cards right, he never will be back down at the same level of again. Like if you think
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.620]   about the growth of Facebook from that point forward, with the exception of the last year,
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.100]   like just let's discount that for now, because that's not the point of this story. It just
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.900]   basically was exponential from that point forward. Facebook just grew endlessly, because
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.940]   if you play your cards right in that window, then you'll never go back down to the same
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.540]   level of again. But if you fuck it up, I know this because I did. Then you basically have
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.820]   to start all over to build up momentum. Momentum is incredibly hard to build, but it's incredibly
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.980]   powerful once you do, and it's very hard to get it back when you lose it. And so that's
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.060]   basically what's happening when you think about sort of progress. So, you know, as far
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.460]   as what motivated me to keep going, yeah. Did I want some of those external accolades?
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.100]   Absolutely. Like anybody else, I, you know, I was somewhat driven by those things. But
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.380]   the irony of my book deal was what led to the book deal was me giving up on getting
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.460]   a book deal, because I realized I was like, I have no control over this. I'm just going
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.980]   to do one thing. And I mean, you've probably seen this article, like Julian Smith turned
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.700]   me on to this habit of writing a thousand words a day. And I was like, OK, you know
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.160]   what? I can do that. Like I'm already doing close to that. But like if I just do this
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.140]   one thing consistently, let me see what happens. You know, and six months into that, I self
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.260]   published two books, one sold a thousand copies. The second became Wall Street Journal bestseller
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.500]   and led to a six figure book deal. And I kept that habit up for almost four years. Like
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.060]   I've changed that now because of the sort of new systems that I've learned for writing
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.620]   and knowledge management. And we can talk about that if you want. But the reality is
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.980]   that like, you know, if you are measuring progress, let's take another simple example
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.020]   of like weight loss or going to the gym. Right. You can't necessarily control how quickly
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.980]   the pounds are coming off. And if you're going to measure by the scale, then you're going
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.020]   to look at the scale every day and be like, OK, I still weigh the same that I did every
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.420]   day. And then yesterday, you know, I got to hell with this. I'm going to not go to the
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.340]   gym. I'm going to sit around and eat ice. Yeah, that's kind of me. Yeah. Yeah. But if
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.100]   you if but the thing is, if you say, OK, look, I'm going to just measure how many days in
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:51.740]   a row that I go to the gym, then you see progress. Yeah. Like the progress starts to appear.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.740]   And the funny thing is that outcomes are usually delayed. Like positive outcomes for good habits
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.380]   are almost always delayed. There's you know, you have sort of habits with delayed consequences
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.020]   and we have good and bad habits with delayed consequences. Right. Like smoking is an example
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.980]   of a bad habit with a delayed consequence. Like, you know, you and I could be smoking
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.660]   cigarettes from the time we're 20 to 30 and probably we'll be OK, you know, during that
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.940]   time, even if we quit. But that might come back to haunt us when we become 70. Yeah.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.340]   But the thing is, that's whereas the same thing occurs with positive habits, right?
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:26.060]   Like this thousand word a day habit. So if you look at sort of the outcomes of this habit.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.260]   Right. So the first six months I did it, you know, the first three months it got me invited
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.980]   to speak at a conference. The fourth month it got me to write, you know, self publish
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.460]   a book that sold a thousand copies. The fifth month or sixth or seventh. I don't remember
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.820]   what month it was like. It led to the self published Wall Street Journal bestseller month
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:51.540]   something like 18 on the habit. It led to a six figure book contract. And from there,
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.380]   if you look at sort of like the earning potential that went public. So from there was like speaking
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:01.940]   gigs. So suddenly this one like simply simple little habit that took an hour every morning
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:07.060]   literally probably has generated close to half a million dollars in income for me. Right.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.940]   Like indirectly, indirectly. Right. Right. Right. Wow. So with with this knowledge in
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:20.460]   mind, why do people give up? Why not just keep going instead of giving up? Why quit?
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.260]   Well, so so here's the thing. Like so one is, you know, the the progress thing. Look,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.020]   there are times when it makes sense to quit. Like true. True. You know, like so why do
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.780]   people quit? One, because there are times when it makes plenty of sense to quit. And
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.380]   like, but you should know, like, am I quitting because I'm, you know, like frustrated or
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.660]   am I quitting because I know this is going nowhere? So there are certain points where
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.660]   you can say, like, all right, look, this is actually not going to lead anywhere. You know,
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.860]   it's so the irony of me starting a podcast and getting a book deal, the publisher, you
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.820]   know, I started the podcast because since of our told me I wasn't a good writer and
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.300]   he was right. Like, honestly, I don't disagree with that assessment. And I still don't disagree
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.660]   with that assessment, because like if you look at just the sheer numbers, right, is
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.300]   that if you compare the number of people who read my writing to the number of people who
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   listen to my podcast, like the writing pales in comparison. So the numbers kind of are
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.220]   a pretty clear indicator. Like, if you like I said this on a podcast before, if you got
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.900]   readers of mine and Mark Manson, and ask them, who's the better writer, they would all say
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:29.300]   Mark and so would I like and I wouldn't be offended by that, right? So that's one thing.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.820]   The other thing is people don't give it long enough to see progress that they quit before
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.460]   they hit the inflection point. They don't realize that, by the way, just because you
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.180]   can't see the progress and this takes us right back, I realized this is going to feel some
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:48.740]   of the circular. But part of the reason is that people are impatient. That's another
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.220]   reason they quit. They want they basically like I want to start a blog today and I want
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.900]   to be in New York. I mean, you saw this with me, man. Like, I guess I'm pretty sure you
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.940]   called me out on it in one of your blog posts.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.940]   Yeah, I wasn't pretty. I wasn't nice. But I was I was befuddled at the time. I didn't
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.940]   name names. But I was like, but here's what you went to Indonesia or somewhere you're
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.620]   surfing or Costa Rica and you're like, I lost a year like since of our made a good point
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.620]   and he was right.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.060]   I don't disagree with that assessment. Don't get me wrong. That was actually a very important
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.740]   point because it did actually inform a lot of the writing I did later on. So you don't
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.360]   always know, like how it's going to help. Like that actually ended up being a very instrumental
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.420]   sort of part of this entire journey. But on the on the flip side of that, since of our
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.780]   studies, like I think that like living in Costa Rica for six months cost you a year
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.900]   in terms of progress. And so that's the thing, right, is that like you look at the people
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.500]   who do this. The other thing is like at that point, my ego was way too fragile to hear
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.300]   the things I needed to hear. I only wanted to hear what I wanted to hear. Yeah. Whereas
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.220]   now like I'm giving feedback to a friend on a book and I told him I was like, look, you
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.620]   know, you and you guys want feedback on a manuscript. Just know that I don't have any
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.140]   ability to sugarcoat. I'm not going to tell you anything good. I'm going to probably tear
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.740]   this thing to shreds. And he's like, that's exactly what we want. And you've been through
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.020]   this process. You know what that's like. It's it's like an it's like an emotional root canal
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.180]   to have an editor work with you on a book. Yeah, because you have to learn to separate
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:18.540]   the feedback, you know, on you, like from feedback on the work. And because I had a
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.420]   writing coach and she had edited books for Seth Godin, this woman didn't sugarcoat shit
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:28.580]   like literally the closest thing I ever got from a compliment for her in two books was
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:35.860]   good. That was good. Most of the comments were lazy. Try again. Wow. Lazy. Try again.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.220]   Ooh. Yeah. The thing is, well, here's the and I specifically chose her for that reason
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:46.260]   because I knew that she would hold me to a high standard like, you know, and that and
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.260]   even my mentor, Greg, like he rode my ass and you know, uh, there were times when I
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.900]   hated him for it. And I realized what he was doing was he was preparing me for higher stakes
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.460]   situations where I would have to be able to handle myself mentally. Isn't that interesting
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:05.060]   though? When we are younger, you know, we're less experienced and our Eagles are, I guess
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:11.140]   perhaps more fragile, but that's when we need the most amount of feedback and criticism
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.420]   to get better. And that's when we're the least open to it. Yeah. Yeah. So we think we know
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.620]   everything. I might have to write something about that. That's kind of like a, well, so
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.060]   I wrote this piece, um, titled advice to freshmen based on a conversation I was having with
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.220]   my cousin's friend's son who was starting college this year. It's on, on medium. And
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.260]   I think it, like I open it by saying, you have no idea how full of shit you are right
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.820]   now is like the whole sentence. Because think about who you were when you were 20 something
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.380]   versus who you are now. And think about how many things have changed, how much your perspective
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.300]   has changed. Cause I remember asking you about that blog post in which you called me out
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.020]   and even you admitted, you're like, yeah, I could have handled that better. Right? Like
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.500]   the, cause like, I remember at first I was like, ah, I'm like, you know, I was just like,
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.420]   cause I remember I used to think it was like, like I remember there's this long period probably
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.740]   here. I was like, Sam is a, the biggest dick. And then I remember the portfolio book came
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.860]   out and I was like, all right, you know what? You're part of the same imprint. And I was
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.340]   like the fact that you got a book deal with these guys, I'm like, I need to read this.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.540]   And you know, like, and the funny thing is like, again, part of that was my own ego as
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.060]   well, you know, and probably part of that was yours.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.200]   I need to give some background cause I don't think listeners know what we're talking about.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.300]   So I wrote this post called, uh, are there really people who work 40 hours a week or
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.180]   less and complain why they can't get ahead? Okay. And I was right. I think I wrote it
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:31.180]   in 2009 when I was personally dying, uh, working 60, 70 hours a week, I was just getting pummeled
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.240]   and my stock portfolio and real estate portfolio were getting pummeled. So it was really more
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.220]   of a frustration and reflect a representation of how I was feeling. Like I was frustrated
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.500]   and I heard people complain like, wait, why don't I have more success and everything while
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.100]   I was just dying at in the office.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.500]   Yeah. But you weren't wrong. That's the thing, you know, that's the best part is that you
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.820]   weren't actually wrong.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.100]   Well, I mean, I definitely could have been more cordial, but you know, that was just
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.580]   kind of like me being young and being frustrated.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.100]   But again, this is actually one of those interesting things about the way we create, right? Like
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.580]   you could have been more cordial, but you could have just done what you did, which meant
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.860]   it was more authentic. And you know, anytime you're going to create something that resonates,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.100]   it's inevitably going to, like most polarizing things are usually the most resonant.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:19.660]   Yeah. I mean, the post did do well. It did well, but it made no friends. It wasn't like,
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.340]   oh, Sam, come on my podcast. You know, it's like, so be careful people because I mean,
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.860]   you can be irreverent like I was and probably still am, but you got to be really confident
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.820]   in your ability if you're depending on whatever your creative endeavor is to grow.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.020]   Well, not only that, like, you know, as you become, you know, as we talked about, as you
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.660]   become more and more of a public figure, everything changes. So like I wrote this entire piece
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.180]   about the psychology of building an audience on Medium. And like, it's probably the one
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.300]   of the most popular pieces I've written. And it was, it hit pretty hard. Like I didn't
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.980]   sugarcoat anything because I was like, look, I'm like building an audience is not just
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.460]   an exercise in marketing. It's also an exercise in your own mental, you know, psychology and
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:02.260]   how you come across. Like if you're a public figure, how you come across matters, right?
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.220]   You have to be able to control public perception. So you like, you think about the difference
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.140]   between somebody like a president tweeting, you know, versus you and I, like if what you
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:18.140]   say basically gets shared or heard by millions of people, you have to be mindful of how it
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.220]   can be twisted and misinterpreted. Like it's, you know, it's like this giant game of telephone
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.220]   where everything goes wrong.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.260]   Cause like, I remember meeting Glenn Beck, you know, for the first time and like, this
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.580]   is something I learned from, we just asked, you know, watching him. I mean, Glenn has
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.020]   a, as a reputation that honestly he kind of brought on himself. Like if you go back and
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.300]   look at some of the things that he said, I asked him, I was like, you know, my audience
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.140]   kind of hates you.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.300]   But I was like, but I was open minded enough to meet him. Cause I was like, clearly you
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.540]   and I agree on something. You loved my book. So why would I not want to talk to you? I
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.180]   remember that time. Yeah. You know? And I'm like, I didn't even know Glenn Beck was until
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.740]   then. Like literally I was like my dream media appearance of the daily show, which is literally
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.020]   the opposite of Glenn Beck. But you know, I just looked them up and I was like, Glenn
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.300]   Beck, I'm like, Oh, this guy worked at Fox news. And I just went to his like, you know,
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.500]   email form and I was like, Hey, I heard you mentioned my book on your show today. Thanks.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.020]   I've always wanted to sell a thousand copies of a book. I really appreciate your shout
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.900]   out. I literally had no idea who he was.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.380]   It's pretty random. He just picked it up.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.860]   And then I remember I emailed a friend of mine, my friend Angela, and she was like,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.260]   Srini, I don't think you realize how big a deal this is. She was like, go look at your
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.220]   Amazon dashboard. And the book had sold a thousand copies in one day. I was like, okay,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.140]   wait a minute. And then he wrote back and you know, the whole media circus unfolded.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.340]   But because I asked him about this, like, you know, you have this sort of persona and
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.220]   everybody who creates media in the public eye has a persona and there's always a gap
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.420]   between who you are on the internet and who you are in real life. Because listen, there
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.820]   are things that I will say to you off the record are off air that I would never in a
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:51.380]   million years say on a podcast, things that would basically be a PR crisis in the making.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.900]   And so that's what you kind of have to realize. Like all of us have this persona when you're
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.740]   in the public eye, how you come across matters. And this is something I also learned from
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.580]   the whole Netflix reality TV thing. I mean, I know about that, right?
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:09.020]   Yes. Indian matchmaking. Srini was on episode, season one, episode one?
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.220]   Episode two, yeah. Or yeah, season one episode. But you notice the girl they matched me with,
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.460]   how much like negative press she got, right? Oh, she was kind of...
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:22.460]   Well, that's the thing. What that indicates in a lot of ways is her lack of self-awareness.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.220]   Like, "Hey, I'm on camera. Millions of people are going to see this." There's a big difference
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.420]   between being genuine and authentic and just shooting from the hip and saying whatever
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.260]   comes to your mind. And I was already a public figure at that point. And when you're in the
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.900]   public eye, there are a lot of other things that come into play. So even you, for example,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.500]   right? Now you are a portfolio author. So everything you do in the public eye reflects
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:48.500]   on your agent, it reflects on your editor, it reflects on portfolio. So suddenly your
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:54.740]   actions have consequences for other people. And that's what changes with growth. So if
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:01.500]   you think about famous people, the thing about the same stupid scandal that Justin Bieber
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.340]   has or Britney has, if you and I went and did whatever stupid shit they did, nobody
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.540]   would care. Or if you went and punched a random guy at an awards show, nobody would say a
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:18.020]   damn thing. But if Will Smith does it, the whole world knows because he's Will Smith.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.820]   Like these things matter a lot and people don't really think about that.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:28.140]   Yeah, it's something that I really don't like the limelight. I don't like any of that. The
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.820]   main reason why I came out to have a public face during the pandemic was because of all
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.020]   these incidences of Asian hate. And that really bummed me out.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.020]   Yeah, I think that was a good reason.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:43.020]   And I was like, "Let me show my face. Let me be more representative of the Asian community.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.260]   Let me try to provide some value to people and maybe that'll provide more love and empathy
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.220]   for Asian people in this country."
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:55.420]   Yeah, I mean, again, there's this guy, Steve Goldstein, who wrote a book. I don't remember
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:00.060]   the title, but the subtitle is How the Most Powerful People from Washington to Wall Street
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.220]   to Hollywood Get People to Like Them. And he had been a producer for Oprah and it's
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.380]   a really good book. It's one of the best books I've ever read. If you want to build a brand,
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.860]   anybody who's building a personal brand should read that book.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:16.980]   Because there are a couple of things I took away from that book. It was like, okay, one,
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.020]   the public doesn't want to hear about your issues, right? Why does your audience turn
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.580]   to you? Because they want to be inspired. They want advice. They don't want to hear
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:31.340]   that, "Oh, I had a rough day because my kids are misbehaving." They don't give a shit.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.660]   Yeah, unless there is a lesson in there for them, they don't care. And this is something
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.820]   ... There's this fine line between vulnerability and airing your dirty laundry and being a
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.540]   train wreck. And a lot of people don't know where that line is. Because it's really easy
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:49.740]   to get attention on the internet by being a train wreck. So I'll give you an example.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.500]   I saw this post that this girl put on Facebook. She walked in on her boyfriend cheating on
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.700]   her and she literally posted it like 20 minutes after it happened. And of course, there's
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.940]   this outpouring of attention. The problem with that is that that doesn't serve anybody.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.820]   And Danielle LaPorte actually had a really good way of describing it. She said that,
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.700]   "I don't write about or talk about a difficult experience until I finish processing it and
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.380]   there's something of value that I can pass to my audience from it."
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:21.500]   Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. I mean, it is interesting that nobody really cares because everybody's
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.020]   got their own problems. But at the same time, people like to be entertained. That's why
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.900]   reality TV shows ...
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:34.940]   Well, okay. Reality TV is not reality. Let's be honest. Reality is pretty boring. Because
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.620]   if it was like reality, anybody actually filmed the day-to-day reality, it's like, "Here's
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.660]   Srini brushing his teeth. Here's Srini taking a shit. Here's Srini taking a shower. Wow,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.820]   this is really not that interesting." Reality TV is all made by editing, man.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:53.580]   Yeah. No, I totally agree. I was on a reality TV show for one episode of My House is Worth
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:59.860]   What on HGTV. Yeah, and it was pretty interesting. Eight hours, seven hours of filming for like
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.860]   six, seven minutes.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:06.740]   Exactly. I mean, I was in Houston, I think, for two days and you saw probably 20 minutes.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.620]   But I also knew ... I had a cousin who told me, I asked him about this. He's like, "Look."
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.140]   He was like, "In reality," he said, "no matter what the media really says, he's like, 'Anybody
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.260]   can make you look like a jackass with the way they edit.' He said, 'But you got to remember
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.860]   the only thing they can use is what you give them.'"
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.260]   Right. Right. And you gave them good stuff. You didn't look like ...
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.820]   I gave them nothing that they could do against me. That's because I understood how to play
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.820]   it.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:37.340]   Right. Right. Man, it's just such a crazy world. It's kind of ... The more attention
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:42.420]   you can get, if you're a creator or a business person, generally there's a correlation with
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.140]   revenue. And it's just how do you ...
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   Yes and no.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.140]   What? No?
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.620]   Yes and no. So, okay. I think that ... Here's the thing. I wouldn't necessarily say that
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.620]   attention equates to revenue because you know what? You and I could go just ape shit and
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.300]   you could be like, "All right, Shringy and I are going to go out and do cocaine. We're
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.500]   going to film the thing. We're going to go to strip clubs. We could put it on Facebook,
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.500]   Instagram."
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   Okay.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500]   We'd get millions of views. I don't think that would do much for either of our bottom
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:11.660]   lines. So, attention directly doesn't correlate to revenue because there are different types
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:19.220]   of attention. You can get attention for being a train wreck or you can get positive attention.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:24.060]   There are varying degrees to that. It's nuanced. I wouldn't say it ... Unless it's like, "Hey,
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.060]   I own BuzzFeed and I'm going to basically publish these bat shit crazy stories of people
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.100]   like Shringy and Sam going out and doing all this crazy shit." They would be the ones making
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.060]   the money. You and I wouldn't.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.740]   Or like Gawker, but then Hulk Hogan sued Gawker and then they went out of business. So, that's
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   not good.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.300]   Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's nuanced, right? So, that's the thing. This is why context
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:49.860]   matters a lot. And this is, I think, the thing that was so sort of overlooked by almost everybody
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.740]   in a lot of ways. I always jokingly say that my first book, Unmistakable, could have been
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.780]   called Everybody is Full of Shit, even though I'm sure Penguin wouldn't have been ready
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.360]   to publish that. But I have been working on a book about cognitive biases called Everybody
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.820]   is Full of Shit, including me.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.460]   I think that would be a fascinating read.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.860]   Well, if you think about it, in various contexts, this is something that I will say to your
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.380]   audience that I've said over and over to people on podcasts is that you should consider the
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.300]   possibility that every single thing I have said up until this point is potential ... like
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.380]   complete bullshit, because in the context of your life, it could be. You change the
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:29.700]   context and you change the results that you get. All prescriptive advice is context dependent,
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:36.100]   right? So let's just take the example of like a ... so let's take a podcasting course as
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.700]   an example. Two people sign up for the course. I sign up for the course, let's just assume
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.300]   it's 2009, which is already one major point of context, right? I have people come and
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.180]   say, "Well, you teach me how to start a podcast." I'm like, "I don't know the first thing about
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:53.580]   growing a podcast. I started 15 years ago and I was lucky. I don't know jack shit about
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:58.300]   marketing a podcast. I literally plugged a microphone into a laptop and I had a 10 year
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.580]   head start on something that was a gigantic cultural trend. I know the things I've learned
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:09.780]   from people, but let's say you take me and we put me in a podcasting course. As you know
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:14.540]   from knowing me, I'm fairly outgoing. I like to talk to people. Then we bring in this introverted
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.860]   visual artist who's really great at making visual art and some friend of hers is like,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.060]   "Oh, you got to get on this podcast bandwagon." Who do you think is going to be successful
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.900]   regardless of the ... even though we're taking the same course, we're doing the same things,
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.020]   I'm going to absolutely obliterate her because of the fact that the context is different.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.300]   I'm coming to it with a different set of strengths.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.900]   Granted, now let's say we reverse the situations. We're signing up for an online art class and
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.420]   I'm like, "Okay, everybody should start making their own art and posting it on Instagram."
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.380]   So I sign up for the class and she's this incredibly talented visual artist. Guess what?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.580]   She's going to obliterate me in that case because the context matters. We don't like
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.060]   the idea ... there are a lot of things people hate in self-improvement. One of the big ones
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:59.500]   being genetic determinism. That's nonsensical. Your genes matter. I'm sorry to say that.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.300]   You and I are not going to the NBA. No matter how hard we work out, you and I are not going
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.340]   to be competing with LeBron James. He wouldn't even play a game of pick up with you and I.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.780]   Unless you gave him a shit ton of money, which you might have in your bank account, but I
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.780]   don't.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.140]   Yeah, I was looking at becoming a video coordinator for the Warriors. That would be fun. Just
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   get on the plane with them.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.140]   That would be a fun job, right?
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.220]   I remember when Eric Spolster, Miami Heat became ... the only reason I know these things
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.660]   is because I play NBA 2K. That's how I've learned all these random facts from video
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.900]   games. I didn't even realize the Denver Nuggets were the champions until a night ago. My cousin
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.740]   was like, "Oh, the Nuggets won the championship." I was like, "Really? I didn't know that."
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:47.300]   Talk to me about the business of podcasting because it's grown huge, but it seems like
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:53.500]   there's step functions. How does one get sponsors? How does one make money from podcasts?
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:58.060]   The way that all media makes money. Media makes money ... Generally, if you look at
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:04.060]   media from the get go, let's just go back to the early days of media, pre-internet.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:09.180]   How did radio shows make money? How do television shows make money? Why is your cable $20 a
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.620]   month? Because somebody is always subsidizing it. No matter ... even if you consume something
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.460]   for free, somebody is always paying for that. That's why when people bitch about ads, I'm
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.780]   like, "Great. Then send me the check that comes from my advertiser and we'll get rid
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.200]   of the ads." I'm like, "Otherwise, stop complaining about it." You can't complain that you're
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.980]   getting something for free. Why are people complaining about free content? Why? Don't
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.340]   get me wrong. That's a whole other rant. Think about it. Even the people who ... Let's talk
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.020]   about this from the standpoint of your newsletter so people have a better context. All the people
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.980]   who read your newsletter for free, who've never bought your books or done anything,
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.540]   guess what? All the people who buy your books are subsidizing their ability to consume that
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.820]   content. They're the ones that are paying for everybody else. That is at a foundational
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.980]   level kind of how media works. Somebody is always paying for you. There's no such thing
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.580]   as content that's free. Somebody is always paying for it.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.300]   Except for this podcast so far. I have no advertisers.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.660]   The thing is, you have an email list. Those same people who basically bought your books,
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.580]   whoever has made ... Anybody who's ever paid you any money, or in this case, you might
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.820]   be the only person subsidizing it, which for a lot of creators ... Let's say you start
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:23.420]   a newsletter. You're the one subsidizing people's ability to consume that free newsletter. That's
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.340]   sort of the base level. We need sort of a foundation to start with.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:31.020]   Now, of course, how does media get measured? With impressions. If you think about why is
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:37.420]   a Super Bowl ad, God knows how much, a million dollars for 30 seconds? You'll have to fact
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.420]   check.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.420]   I think it's much more now.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.340]   It's just a random number. We're just doing this for the sake ... Because it's based on
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:50.860]   the number of people who watch the Super Bowl. That's why. The flip side of that is what
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.140]   has happened as a byproduct of the internet is that the media landscape has become much
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:00.380]   more fragmented. What has happened is that people like you and me with damn near free
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.540]   or low cost resources, tools, and distribution channels can get on the air, have a conversation
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:11.100]   like this, and you can send it out to 50, 60,000 people. That is like a game changer.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.980]   Now, what that creates, of course, is massive fragmentation in the media landscape because
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.540]   basically, I think Seth Godin put it well. He said you went from 500 channels ... Because
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.980]   if you think about it, before the internet, what did we have? We had sort of 500 channels
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:30.620]   maybe maximum to consume content, whether that's TV, radio, newspapers. You went from
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.380]   that to 500,000 and at this point a million.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.020]   So inevitably, there are two things that have to happen. One is that standing out in that
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:44.100]   sea of noise is not a matter of success. It's a matter of survival. That was one phrase
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.380]   that I'd said over and over in blog posts. I was like, "I really wish I had actually
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.740]   got that phrase into the book because I thought it sounded so punchy and I never managed to."
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.300]   But it's true. You have to be able to stand out in the sea of noise. That's why this whole
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:02.860]   "Let me do what everybody else does and make it work" very rarely works. You bring a unique
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.300]   perspective and unique voice. You brought your perspective. Perspective is really important.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.100]   Point of view is the thing. Justine Musk put it well. She said, "If you have a bold and
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.860]   compelling point of view, it's probably going to piss somebody off." That's okay. It has
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.500]   to. You have to be willing to do that if you want to stand out.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:26.300]   So now you have this fragmentation issue. So with fragmentation, what changes here is
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:32.580]   something different. Loyalty becomes a lot more valuable than reach. Sam Altman put it
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.420]   well. He was talking about this in the context of startups. He said, "It's better to have
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.860]   a small number of people who absolutely love what you do than a large group of people who
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.900]   are lukewarm." Because the thing is that small number of people who love what you do is way
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:52.220]   more scalable over the long haul. You want fanatics, not followers.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.780]   And that's the thing. You want the people – so think about it. An email list – I'll
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.820]   give you another example. I have a friend who started his business long after I did.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.940]   It was like three or four years ago. We had an email list of 6,000 or 7,000 people. He
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.700]   had an email list of 200 people. First product launch, I think, generated something like
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.740]   $25,000 or $30,000. And why is that? Because those people were very specific, qualified
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:21.140]   people for the thing that he was selling. So these are 200 people who want to hear from
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.900]   him every week. So you're better off with 5,000 people who open every email you send
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.180]   than 50 million who don't open half of them. I mean, inevitably, those numbers will change
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.260]   as you grow.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.900]   But the thing is that – and I realize you asked me about the business of podcasting,
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.920]   but you kind of can't talk about the business of podcasting without talking about the business
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:45.300]   of media at large. So if you think about sort of what has happened, right? Over this time
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.780]   period, as this media landscape has become fragmented, it's not just people like you
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.420]   and I who are also trying to figure this out now. The big media companies, the biggest
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:58.420]   threat to them is people like you and I. Like the fact that Joe Rogan is more popular than
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:04.700]   some well-known media pundit who's been working at CNN for 30 years is very telling.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.060]   And so one of the things that happens – and there are a lot of people who are like, "Oh,
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.900]   I want to be the next Oprah." And I was like, "That's absolutely not a smart goal.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.540]   It's in fact a stupid goal. One, because you're not going to be the next Oprah. But
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:20.500]   two, the reality of our media landscape – and WBEZ did a podcast about this called The Making
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.180]   of Oprah, and one of the producers of Oprah herself said there is no way there will be
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.660]   another Oprah because the media – because think about when Oprah started. Like you didn't
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.220]   have the internet, right? She predates the internet and by the time the internet came
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:38.460]   around, Oprah was already Oprah. And so when you have such a fragmented media landscape,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:44.460]   there's just no way that's possible in this environment. But loyalty on the other
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.820]   hand scales very well. So then how do you monetize that?
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.380]   Ads – unfortunately, ads basically depend on one thing and that's numbers, right? And
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:42:00.100]   so advertising for the most part is a pretty shitty business model for independent creators.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:04.300]   We just happen to be in a position where we can generate enough off of ads to make a decent
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.860]   living, but there's no way I could depend entirely on ads. Like I have an online – like
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:12.220]   I've started a completely separate business which is like a knowledge management business.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:17.740]   That will – my guess is in – it's like a knowledge management and AI consulting business.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.980]   Within the next year, I'm pretty sure the revenue from that will dwarf the revenue from
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:25.420]   Unmistakable Creative unless we hit millions of listeners. So it depends. Like if you're
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:31.060]   Jordan Harbinger, yeah, I mean he's probably banking $60,000, $70,000 a month easy, maybe
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.060]   more.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   Trevor Burrus: Who's Jordan Harbinger?
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.220]   Patrick Shephard: Jordan Harbinger runs a podcast called The Jordan Harbinger Show.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.700]   It's like wildly popular. He's got – I think he actually signed a $2 million or $3
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:46.300]   million contract with Podcast One or one of these big like podcast networks just because
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:52.540]   he had the audience. He had the numbers. So if you have those kinds of numbers, then you
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.460]   can support yourself with ads. But for the overwhelming majority of people, especially
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.700]   people who are starting out, it's just not viable. You also want to think about, "OK.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   Is this really the best way to monetize my skills? Is this the channel where I'm going
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.700]   to shine?"
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.820]   Why did I take the podcasting? Because Sid Sivar said I was a shitty writer and he was
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:16.100]   right. Like I'm a much better interviewer than I am a writer and I know that. Like I'm
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.660]   aware of that. That's why I have no like issue saying – like I didn't get another
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.100]   book deal after my books came out. I was like, "You know what?" Like I came to terms
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.260]   with the fact that I write for myself if my audience happens to like it, great. But the
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.460]   podcast is what I do for my audience primarily.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:34.460]   Trevor Burrus: Right. So it sounds like a tough road to make enough money from a podcast
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.860]   to provide basic living expenses. So for those who are thinking about – I mean so I guess
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:46.420]   one, how can listeners support us creators, us podcasters? And two, should people start
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.420]   their own podcast?
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.140]   Steven Wooten: Well, let's talk about supporting creators. Like I think that they're really
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.700]   sort of different forms. I mean you can support people by supporting them financially. Like
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.020]   buy Sam's book if you haven't bought it yet. So shameless plug for Sam's book.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.580]   Trevor Burrus: And Trini's too.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:06.620]   Steven Wooten: Yeah. But the other thing, the big one really is tell other people, right?
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:10.940]   Because your audience is like your ideal marketing channel because they don't cost as – it's
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.580]   like if you're going to consume this for free, help us spread the word for free. That
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:20.420]   is what I would say is that – and it's not easy. Like look, you and I probably – I
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.500]   mean how much content do you and I consume that we never share? Let's be honest. Like
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.940]   I probably read hundreds of articles. I don't tweet those articles, share them with my audience
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.940]   or anything like that.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.940]   Trevor Burrus: Sure, sure. That makes sense. Yeah.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.260]   Steven Wooten: It's not easy. I mean we're – but the thing is like share with somebody
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.700]   who you actually think would benefit from it. So that is one thing I do do is like I
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.020]   share with friends and family members. When I read something interesting, I'm like, "Oh,
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.220]   OK. Cool." Like this person would find this interesting. That's actually how a lot of
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.820]   our growth happens is like we have people who – like if you look at some of the writings
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.620]   reviews, like one woman is like, "My entire family listens to the show." That's what
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.740]   you want, right? Those are really – that's a huge form of support. Spreading the word
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.500]   is literally the most supportive thing you could do that costs you nothing other than
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   a few seconds of your time.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:07.580]   Trevor Burrus: And how valuable or invaluable are reviews? The number of views, the level
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.580]   of reviews?
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.540]   Steven Wooten: So there's – the iTunes algorithm for podcasts is kind of a mystery
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:18.780]   like everything else at Apple. It's like the Bermuda Triangle of information. Rumor
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.980]   has it it actually has more to do with the number of weekly subscribers, new subscribers
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.260]   than it does reviews that determine like where you go in the rankings. Reviews are social
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.580]   proof though, right? Like I don't know about you. I very – even on Amazon, I almost
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.460]   never read the book reviews. I just download the free Kindle chapter first because like
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.780]   I don't care if somebody else hated the book. I want to know if I'm going to like
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.780]   it.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.580]   Now again, for certain products, like there will be certain things that I want. Like so
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.580]   for example, if I'm going to buy – like I'm trying to find – I've been wasting
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.940]   money on lattes at Starbucks and I don't really care that much about lattes. This is
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.860]   like one of those things. It's like I should cut relentlessly on this because I don't
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.340]   give a shit. But I want a latte maker that I know will take as little time as possible
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.620]   in the morning because I don't want to sit here with a stupid – that I would actually
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.620]   go and look at the reviews to see if the function is there that I need.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.420]   I bought a tool, a microphone when I was traveling and I wanted to make sure that the sound was
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:13.620]   good. So I looked at the reviews for things like that. But like – so reviews – like
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.060]   reviews are social proof more than anything else, right? Like if you go into – and I
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.540]   will tell you this. Like I've had people who try to email me and be like, "Hey,
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.380]   I have a podcast," and I go and look and I'm like, "OK, this thing has like two
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.780]   reviews." I'm like, "Nobody listens to this show."
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:29.020]   So it's like, "OK, if you see a podcast with 1,005 star reviews, it's like, OK,
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.860]   there's some cred there. Like there's credibility."
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.860]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.380]   That more than any – it's just – reviews basically – I don't know how – what
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.740]   impact they have on rankings. You will have to fact check me on this. But I think more
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.460]   than anything, they just shape perception. Like you're much more likely to subscribe
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.340]   to something if there are 1,005 star reviews than if there are like zero reviews.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.580]   Right. You know, one of the interesting things I've noticed about the creator economy
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:56.300]   is that there are people who don't seem to have the experience, the relevant experience
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:01.100]   and talk about things that it doesn't seem like they should be talking about.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.380]   That's the entire internet, man.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.980]   One of the reasons why I started Financial Timeline in 2009 was because I felt I needed
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.660]   at least 10 years of experience in finance before talking about finance. So I graduated
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:17.300]   in 1999. So I was like, "I'm going to wait for 10 years." But before that, I
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.180]   was just – I was seeing people, how to get rich.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:24.900]   So you noticed – do you notice the one topic that I very rarely talk about on anything
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.740]   I write is money? Why? Because I don't have any credibility in that arena. Like I need
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.100]   to learn from people like you. Your evidence backs it up. Like you have experience. But
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.140]   I will write – like I don't think you could hold a candle to me when it comes to
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.580]   writing about creativity. Like that's my expertise, right? And if you want to talk
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:49.900]   about building systems for productivity, like I would outperform you by a long shot on that.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.620]   But again, to your point, like there are a lot of people – basically it was like the
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:00.620]   curse of knowledge. What is that – there's a term for this, the Dunning-Kruger effect
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.300]   where people think they know more than they do.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.300]   It's delusion.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:10.980]   But how do we help listeners and readers separate reality from fiction I guess? Or is it just
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   entertainment because it just doesn't cost anything?
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.660]   Well, on the internet, you – so part of it is that. But you also have to be willing
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.620]   to question and like have skepticism about what you're hearing. Like I told you, you
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.100]   should think – consider the possibility of everything I'm telling you is bullshit
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.220]   because you need to think about everything that you hear in the context of your own life.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.660]   Like I remember some girl wrote this piece about the creator economy being a gold mine
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.620]   and I was like, "That's horse shit. It's not." I'm like, "The creator economy
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:41.060]   is a developing country. It's ripe with inequality." Like you can't use outliers
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.020]   to make generalized statements.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:48.420]   This is actually one of the big problems with success literature in general is that almost
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.420]   all success literature is based on stories about buyers. Like because you don't put
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   people on the covers of magazines when they spend years working their asses off and amount
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:56.420]   to nothing.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.580]   And so like if you read stories – and even Paul Graham talks about this in his essay
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.380]   on wealth which if you're just having read that, you should link that up for them. It's
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.540]   really good. But he says at the very beginning like people like Bill Gates are not good role
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.540]   models because he's an outlier.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.900]   He said he's like Bill Gates, people seem to forget, was like the beneficiary of one
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.420]   of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business. That IBM selling him that operating
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.020]   system for 50 grand. He said from that point forward, all he had to do was execute. It's
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:29.700]   like would Bill Gates have been rich? Yes. Would he have been Forbes top 10 rich? No.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.540]   And so we forget that, right? So like the problem is that if you – or you look at
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:40.140]   Elon, right, as an example. It's like Granted, Elon has gone off the deep end but the problem
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.680]   is that – my mentor Greg used to talk about this. He's like there's this distinction
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.740]   between probability and possibility, right? Like is it possible that you could achieve
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:54.740]   at the level of Elon or Bill Gates or you and I could get to the NBA? Yeah. Is it probable?
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.540]   Hell no. Especially the NBA thing. So that's where you have to really understand is the
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:04.940]   distinction is like, OK, and what determines the probability of your ability to accomplish
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:10.900]   something is the context. Like context plays a big role in the probability of your success.
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:17.460]   So think about – go back to the podcasting example. You can't deny the fact that I
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:22.380]   had a 10-year head start and that was pretty damn instrumental in me getting to where I'm
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:28.060]   at. Like I wouldn't be where – like if I started today, nobody would know who I am.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.860]   I mean relatively speaking, nobody knows who I am. Like I always say I'm the most connected
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:38.260]   person nobody knows. Well, in terms of outliers, do you think we are outliers or we are just
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.860]   people who just kept on grinding to get to where we are? So you and I have some – we
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:48.220]   had outlier advantages, right? So let's look at where we are outliers. One, we had
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:52.700]   a big head start on something that – like even blogging, we're well ahead of the curve.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.660]   By the time – even 2009, we were kind of late to the game but we were way earlier than
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.300]   most people. Like it was a lot easier to build an audience back then than it is now.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.580]   Well, think about it. Right now, it's easier than ever to start and it's harder than
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.620]   ever to stand out. Like back then, it was pretty simple. It was just like you build
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.500]   a blog, you comment. I mean how did I meet you? I think it was because I commented on
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.300]   your blog post. Like literally that's how we met and that was kind of part of the way
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.420]   you grew. You basically commented on other people's blogs and you just – and the
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   same things that worked then wouldn't work now. So that plays a role, right?
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.060]   The other thing we have to think about is like look at our backgrounds. I mean I don't
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.220]   know what your parents did for work but we came –
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.940]   They worked in the government.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.740]   Yeah. So relatively speaking, we came from privileged circumstances. Like my dad being
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:43.220]   a college professor, there's no question whether you or I were going to go to college.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.140]   So you can't basically say, "OK. Well, why is the person who grew up in the hood
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:52.140]   getting shot at who has the same books that you and I do not getting the same results?
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.540]   Well, you and I didn't grow up getting shot at, watching people sell drugs on the street
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:03.140]   corner. That makes a difference. Context matters a lot. So yes, in some ways you and I are
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.140]   outliers. Like maybe not – so we have to think about this outlier thing to varying
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.140]   degrees, right?
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.940]   Are we Elon Musk outlier? No. But are we outliers? Yes.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:19.180]   Interesting. It is interesting because the longer I go about the creative part of things,
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:25.260]   the more I think, "Well, if you just keep on going, something good will eventually happen."
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.640]   I feel that.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:33.100]   There is a grain of truth to that but again, context, right? So there are times when it
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.860]   would make sense for you to stop, to quit where you're like, "All right." So I'll
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:42.700]   give you an example. So when my friend Gareth launched his Airtable consulting business
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.100]   and I saw it like just blossom into this like wildly successful business in like nine months,
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.700]   I thought to myself, "Well, you know what? I use Notion. I really love Notion and I don't
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.540]   even use Notion anymore. So I'm going to basically use his exact same model and I'm
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:59.460]   going to basically start putting these tutorials on YouTube for Notion."
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.180]   The thing that had happened by that point is I was so far like so late to the game for
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.520]   that. There were already like a hundred people doing tutorials on Notion who were doing better
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:12.820]   tutorials than mine. But when Mem, the tool I use now, came along, I saw an opportunity
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.180]   and I was like, "You know what? I have an opportunity here to actually be the de facto
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:22.580]   guy." Like Mem, even the team at Mem calls me their product evangelist. And I was like,
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.860]   "Okay." Because what was different? One, is I was first. Two, I had all this knowledge
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:32.060]   that I could apply to it. And three, the timing had changed. Like now AI is generative AI
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:36.140]   is huge. Like there's all these trends in generative AI. And I know how to use this
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:39.460]   stuff in a way that most people don't. Like I know a lot about automation that I learned
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:44.180]   from my friend Gareth's Airtable consulting business. And largely because I built these
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.060]   systems for running my own business. So like all the systems I use for running my own business,
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:52.140]   I was like, "Wait a minute. This is a business in and of itself." But it was like a business
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.260]   that emerged organically. And the way I went about it was very different from Unmistakable.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.340]   Right from the get-go, I was like, "I'm going to create YouTube videos. I'm going to collect
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.480]   email addresses and I'm going to use those email addresses to sell these people a course
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.820]   and sell them consulting." I was like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So it was very intentional
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.500]   right from the get-go. And I've spent $5 a day driving ads to these videos. And I think,
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.980]   I mean, relatively speaking, it's small, but we have about 2,000 subscribers on this YouTube
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.980]   channel now.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:20.620]   Okay. And it sounds like this opportunity came about because you've been in the game.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:25.580]   Yeah. I mean, so that's the thing, right? So there is value to continuing going. So
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:30.140]   you kind of have to think about, okay, you can't let sunk cost bias keep you doing something
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.380]   that you shouldn't continue to do. It's worth having kill criteria where you say, "Okay,
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.020]   this is what any Duke wrote about this in her most recent book of the power of knowing
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.860]   when to walk away." And there is value in that. It's like, okay, I'm going to give this
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:48.700]   to like X date, because otherwise it's very easy to just get into this sort of Sisyphean
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.860]   effort that leads nowhere. Like if you spent 15 years doing something and it's not getting
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.780]   you somewhere, then maybe you should call it quits. Because I think that that's the
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:03.800]   problem with a lot of prescriptive cliched advice is that it just gives you these nice
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.460]   motivational slogans like winners never quit, which is horseshit. Like that's terrible advice.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.980]   There are times when you should quit.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:16.580]   Yeah. You know, you've interviewed so many creators over the years. What would you say
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:23.460]   the two, three attributes are that they have that maybe non-creators or just regular folks
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.820]   don't have? What makes them stand out?
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.660]   I think that the things that make them stand out are there in everybody. They're just latent,
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:37.820]   right? So the first one I think is a really bold point of view and a willingness to express
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:44.460]   that point of view unapologetically. The second is the ability to overcome their social programming
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.660]   and basically write their own script, right? Because like if you think about it, all of
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.660]   us are the byproduct of inherited scripts that we've inherited from media, parents,
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.140]   peer society, whatever. Like we've been told all these narratives our entire lives. So
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:58.340]   like this is what your good life is supposed to look like. But that's based on somebody
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:01.460]   else's script. Like that's not what your good life looks like necessarily. It's like, you
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.260]   know, Rameen talks about in Rich Life, he's like, your rich life should fit you like a
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.060]   velvet glove. Like you and I probably have very different versions of what a rich life
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   looks like. And we should. And that's one big problem on the internet is that people
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:17.940]   basically look at other people's goals as their sort of baseline. They think that they're
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:21.420]   their own goals, but the reality is like you're basically letting somebody else determine
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.660]   how you live your life.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:27.820]   So like even what you go back to this four hour work week idea, right? I was like, oh,
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.900]   is that really success on your own terms? I'm like, you've literally just traded in,
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.140]   you know, the sort of corporate America definition of success for Tim Ferriss's definition of
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:40.300]   success. That's not your definition of success. So overcoming their social programming is
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:45.100]   one. And then I think the other one is just a relentless work ethic. You know, like every
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:51.260]   one of them works. Like I mean, to your point, like the funny thing is like I realized once,
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:56.060]   you know, reality set in and I knew that I wanted to really build a business like, like
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.860]   it's no coincidence that when I came back from Costa Rica and I started working and
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:04.300]   consistently busting my ass, the business changed for the better. Like, you know, do
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.340]   I still want to like be able to surf for a couple hours every day? Yeah. And ironically,
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:11.580]   now I have more freedom to do that and I spend more time working.
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.100]   The success of work often is more work. So be careful.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:20.340]   It's yeah. Be careful what you wish for because like the the other, oh, actually this is really
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.740]   actually probably the foundational thing at the core of all of it is the ability to
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.220]   manage their psychology. Right. They don't like if you look at sort of high performers
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:34.780]   at every level, they like just were talking top of their game. And I never forgot this.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.300]   This was like one of the most useful nuggets I got from the Tim Ferriss interview. Right.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:42.060]   He was he was telling me a story about how he was with Matt Mullenweg, the founder of
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:48.180]   Atomic, the guy who created WordPress. They were like Indonesia. Yeah. And apparently
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:52.300]   one of their data centers was down and somebody called that and he was like, OK, great. He
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.140]   was like, well, tell him we're on it. And Tim Ferriss looks at him and he was like,
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:00.020]   isn't that a big deal? Which you think right for WordPress, a data center being down is
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.780]   a big deal. Yeah. And he was like, yeah, there's nothing I can do about it. People are working
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.060]   on it. And he said that always stayed with him. And so he had this sort of phrase that
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.220]   he would ask himself any time something crazy happened. He was like, what would Matt Mullenweg
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:15.820]   do? And it's funny because I noticed that in myself, because I remember once when I
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:19.020]   was having a hosting issue, this is like in the day, like early, early days of blogging,
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.540]   like my site went down and I was because we had a post go viral or something like that.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.820]   And we're on go to stressful. Yeah. And but the funny thing is that like I had an issue
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.500]   with one of our online courses where people couldn't access the course for about two days.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:38.460]   And I was like, yeah, guys, I'm on it. You know, like I was like, what is the point of
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:42.420]   me freaking out over that? Because I realized like my mom is like this and I realized my
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.780]   mom would be a billionaire if she could take her energy and put it into non-trivial things.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:49.220]   But she puts so much energy into trivial things like, oh, the towel needs to be hung like
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.420]   this. So it dries the shoes in the shoe closet need to all be symmetrical, which they never
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.300]   are. I'm like, like if you would spend this energy and directed towards something important,
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.900]   then you could actually accomplish something. It's like they don't spend time, energy or
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:08.380]   attention on trivial things. And even on important things, they understand that like freaking
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:13.580]   the hell out over it doesn't change the situation. So they really know how to emotional regulation
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.220]   and managing a psychology. That's the foundation, I would say, of all of them. We're really,
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:22.180]   really good at what they do. Like nothing really rattled. Like even if they're rattled,
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:26.980]   you would never know it. Yeah, that's I think that's so true. And that takes us back to
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:31.380]   the public for you and I don't have the luxury of being rattled. So I'll give you an example.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:37.100]   You know, I met this girl in India and she came to visit and, you know, it didn't work
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:41.700]   out. I mean, she kind of just blew me off. And I remember the night before my brother
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:44.060]   called me. He's like, Yeah, man, are you OK? I was like, Listen, man, I don't have the
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.660]   luxury of like sitting here crying over some girl. I'm like, I have a speaking engagement
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:52.380]   tomorrow. I got to be on my game. That's the other thing. You are never not on your game.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:57.140]   Like that's just the reality of public eye. No matter what. The truth is that your personal
[00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:03.580]   life is basically like your own problem. When you're the guy, you cannot have meltdowns.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:13.540]   Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate that insight. I mean, the podcast is amazing.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:18.900]   Your endurance for 13 years recording all those episodes. I'm basically starting off
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.740]   on my interview journey. So I really appreciate you coming on. It's been wonderful. Yeah,
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.980]   man, this has been fun. I love conversation. It's like one of my favorite things about
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.100]   like the interviews. I rarely get interviewed. Like I'm always doing the interview. But like
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.980]   I've walked away from this with like a, you know, you made me think about the outlier
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:37.660]   ideas like, Oh, I have like three different blog posts I could write based on this conversation.
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:42.940]   Well, that's awesome. Well, I hope we keep in touch. Yeah, I'm always around. And I really
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.360]   admire that you've had so much grit to keep on going and grow your Unmistakable Media
