[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.400]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.240]   I'm on location today in the home office in New York City.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.220]   I'm actually in the office with Duncan today.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.060]   - Yeah.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.880]   - Duncan, I need to offer-
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.720]   - Not in the same room again though.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.300]   We can't make that same mistake again.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.240]   - No, we learned our lesson.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.340]   I need to offer a mea culpa from last week.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.480]   So last week we talked about Series I savings bonds.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.500]   There was some very strong proponents
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.040]   of Series I savings bonds,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.760]   and a lot of people put me in my place.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.740]   They told me, I think I said,
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.160]   "It's not as easy to just automate investments through those."
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.940]   A lot of people put me in my place and said,
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.960]   "Actually, you can.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200]   "You can automate Series I savings bonds.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.960]   "Credit to me for admitting my mistakes when I'm wrong."
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.920]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean-
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   - So that is something you actually can do.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.620]   I think you can do it on a monthly or quarterly basis.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.820]   - As long as you can give a treasury direct site to work.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.700]   - So here's what I remember.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.540]   So I actually, yes,
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.620]   I actually had some Series I savings bonds.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.980]   I set it up on an automatic thing, autopilot,
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.060]   five minute wait to talk to someone.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.260]   And they don't even have the option to hit a button
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.180]   to say, "We'll call you back."
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.660]   It's just like, "Just wait here like an idiot
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.900]   "and see what happens."
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.740]   - Right.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.740]   - So yes, they still, I was right on that one.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.340]   They still are a little antiquated
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.180]   in how they help with customer service.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.160]   The website stinks.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.000]   - Yeah.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.060]   I saw someone actually was like complimenting
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.540]   their like bare bones website.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.860]   So I mean, I guess, you know, that's like you say,
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.340]   that's what makes a market, I guess.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.700]   - It looked like the original Amazon one
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.220]   from like when Bezos was in his garage.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.060]   All right.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.100]   Remember, if you have a question for us,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.500]   We'll be pulling questions from the live chat too.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.420]   I always see we get some good ones in the YouTube chat,
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.260]   all that stuff.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.020]   We'll find them if you send them to us.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.260]   Let's do the first one.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.580]   - Okay.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.820]   So up first, we have some long ones today.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.260]   So hang in there, hang in there.
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.100]   Okay.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.360]   My wife is 26 and graduating in May
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.200]   to become a nurse practitioner.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.280]   I'm 28 and a mechanical engineer.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.440]   We have $265,000 in retirement accounts
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.240]   and $35,000 in taxable accounts.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.280]   All in the Vanguard Total World Index Fund.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.320]   We have $33,000, 10% of our portfolio
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.420]   and alternatives like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.860]   and whole life insurance.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.640]   And we have $20,000 in cash,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.040]   which covers four to five months of expenses.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.220]   We're moving back near our family in rural Minnesota.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.620]   First baby on the way in a week.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.980]   And due to the hot housing market,
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.240]   we'll leave Wisconsin with $165,000 of cash
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.900]   from selling our house.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300]   With retirement accounts maxed out,
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.940]   here's my plan for the cash.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.740]   Put $50,000 into a down payment
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.180]   for an old $150,000 farmhouse within our family.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660]   Use $70,000 to pay off student loans
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.500]   and put $10,000 into I-bonds.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.020]   Shout out you guys.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.100]   What do I do with the remaining $35,000?
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.000]   No other debt, cars run well,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.280]   new house meets all of our needs.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.920]   This sounds like a good problem to have.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.120]   - Well, yes, for people in their late 20s,
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.360]   they have things figured out pretty well
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.200]   as far as their finances go.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.000]   Obviously, also the government should be giving us
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.260]   a kickback, I think, for all the Series I savings bonds
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.100]   that we've sold on their behalf.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.200]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.640]   - So, you know, with the caveat that we don't know
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.080]   exactly what you're doing with this money
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.120]   and the time horizon, risk profile, yada, yada,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.080]   we've talked about in the past.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.340]   I'm gonna focus in on the child part here.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.560]   So they said they're having a baby in a week.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.120]   Maybe we got this before and they already had the kid.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.660]   Congratulations, very exciting.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.320]   Before we get to like the allocation side of things
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.800]   and what it means financially to have a kid,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.900]   there was a, you get a lot of advice when you're a parent
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.880]   or just about to become a parent
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.160]   from people who already are parents.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.000]   And they tell you exactly,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   here's what you need to do for sleep training.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.960]   This is the kind of food you need to feed.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.480]   By this age, they should be doing this.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.720]   And most of that is worthless
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.280]   because all kids are different.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.720]   So I have twins and I know for a fact
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.320]   this nature versus nurture thing.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.440]   I would like to think that my wonderful parenting skills
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   are going to help them be the people
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.680]   that they're gonna become.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.520]   But I have a boy and girl who couldn't be more different.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.900]   They don't look alike, they don't act alike.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.480]   They're totally different.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.920]   And so a lot of it is just the kid is the way they are,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   I think.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.520]   I'm sorry to break some, pop some bubbles there.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.160]   So all the other, that type of parenting advice,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.920]   here's what I wish I would have known.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.720]   First of all, don't waste your money on nice furniture.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.280]   Kids get everything dirty.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.520]   So if you're gonna get some furniture,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.080]   make sure it's leather because it cleans up easier.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.320]   Get rid of every single lamp you have in your house
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.680]   that's on an end table because it will get broken
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   or the bulbs will get broken.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.920]   I also think consider getting rid of any sharp coffee tables
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   get those like fabric ottomans
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.800]   because the coffee tables,
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.080]   once they start to pull themselves up and walk
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.620]   like the corners, you're just looking for a head injury.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.760]   Here's another one.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.160]   Get yourself a good cordless vacuum cleaner.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.440]   We shelled out for a Dyson, not to brag, right?
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.600]   It's kind of a high-end model,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.760]   but we tried some other ones and they kept breaking.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.260]   In the Dyson, we've probably put, I don't know,
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.480]   if it's a car, we put 120,000 miles on that.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.600]   I use it like six times a day and it's amazing.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.880]   You have to have a cordless one too
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.900]   'cause you're pulling it out to use it all the time.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.740]   Here's another one.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.420]   Don't skimp on a nice washer, dryer, dishwasher.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.800]   So if you need to upgrade a little bit in the house,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.680]   that's probably not a bad idea.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.000]   We probably use ours every day.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   We do so much.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.320]   We have three kids, so we do a ton.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.400]   Here's one more.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   I was gonna invent this
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   and do it on Shark Tank to Mark Cuban.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.980]   Multiple blades for a pizza cutter.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.700]   I want like five of them when I'm cutting up quesadillas
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.200]   and I'm trying to cut off the edges
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.300]   on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, that's helpful.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.440]   So get multiple of those.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.600]   And finally, the Mr. Clean magic erasers
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.320]   for when they put their little grubby hands
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.720]   all over the wall and they get older.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.960]   They really are magic.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.920]   All right, so here's something else
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.320]   I wasn't prepared for as a parent.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   The cost of childcare is insanely high.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   Duncan, before we got on,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.800]   you were complaining about your rent in Brooklyn.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.720]   Your rent might cover childcare.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960]   Now, this can be a contentious issue for people
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.720]   because you have some people who say,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.040]   how could you possibly let other people raise your children?
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.760]   Which is always an argument to me
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.360]   because you send your kids to school and they have teachers.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.560]   Like, are the teachers raising them?
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   - Unless you have to school 'em until they go off to college.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.480]   - But then you have other people who say,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.440]   how could you give up your career for your children?
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.800]   What kind of example are you setting?
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   And so this is one of those things
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.800]   that you're never gonna win.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.960]   And it's whatever you do, like someone might judge you,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.680]   but it's totally a personal decision.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.800]   We decided to, my wife wanted to keep working.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.600]   She went down to part-time and we sent the kids to daycare.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.800]   Some people, obviously, the other one
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.720]   is you're lucky enough to have family around to help,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.080]   but that's a big ask for grandma and grandpa, right?
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.640]   So we think it's been worth it
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.320]   because they learn to socialize, they learn.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.920]   Like the other day, my twins started singing a song
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.400]   in Spanish out of nowhere.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.680]   And I'm like, how do you guys know Spanish?
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.760]   Oh, we learned it at school.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.280]   They get some independence, they make little friends.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.560]   My eight-year-old daughter,
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.800]   her two best friends in the world,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.200]   she met 'em when she was three months old in daycare.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.040]   And they're still best friends to this day,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.340]   but it is very expensive.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.120]   So I was doing my taxes.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.760]   Bill Sweet, who's been on the show a bunch of times,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.920]   he actually does my taxes.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.600]   But I, listen, I lend a helping hand.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.860]   I get it ready for him and leave it on a silver platter
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.700]   from TurboTax.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.040]   - I think you have to say not to brag
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.300]   because that's like having LeBron James
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.680]   do your basketball lessons, you know?
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.520]   - This is true, yeah.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.880]   I have my own tax consultant, Bill Sweet,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.960]   and I get it ready for him on TurboTax
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.280]   and get it as far as I can take it and he finishes it.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.000]   And it asks, like, what did you pay for childcare?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.780]   So I added it up and I thought, you know,
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.960]   my daughter's eight, my twins are gonna be five soon
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   and they're gonna be in kindergarten.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.040]   So I'm almost done.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.320]   Eight years worth of paying for childcare.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.720]   So I thought, like, what if I went through
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.200]   and looked at my old spreadsheets and added it up?
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   And so I go through and add up eight years of childcare.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.020]   Now, obviously it's on and off a little bit
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.480]   from the pandemic.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.080]   There was two years where we overlapped.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.320]   We had three kids in it.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   And I kind of had an idea, but I figured out the number.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.700]   It was huge.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.320]   We basically put the kids through college.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.600]   So we're in the trust tree here.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.080]   I can tell the number to people.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.320]   - I think so.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.500]   - It was close to $170,000.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.920]   - Imagine if you'd put that in the arc.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.340]   - And we live in Michigan where, like,
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.280]   it could be worse in other states.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.000]   So obviously, again, we had three kids.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   A lot of the time they were going full-time.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.960]   And so it worked out roughly like $20,000 a year.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.160]   So we didn't have time.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.480]   Like, we didn't have 18 years to prepare
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.000]   like you do for college to save in a 529 plan.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.400]   This was just kind of thrust upon us.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.000]   And I knew it was gonna be expensive.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.360]   And having three kids, don't tell my kids this,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.240]   having twins was not really in the plan.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.720]   So having three was not really ever,
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.680]   that was kind of a...
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.440]   But it's so much more expensive than...
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.080]   So obviously, the trade-off being,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.440]   unless you have someone who can help and do it for free,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.560]   either someone's gonna have to give up their income,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.080]   potentially, in their career,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.640]   or you're gonna have to pay for childcare.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.120]   So either way, it's going to be expensive.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.320]   We had one friend who actually,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.480]   his wife worked on the weekends.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.760]   He worked during the week.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.160]   And they just never saw each other.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   And they like trade it off.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.880]   So it's not easy.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.520]   So I would say,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.840]   this is on the 2021 cost of childcare survey.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.760]   They said 85% of parents they surveyed
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.200]   spend more than 10% of their household income,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.800]   average being about 10 grand a year.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.320]   And they said that's actually more expensive
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.060]   than the average annual in-state cost of college.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.720]   So it costs more to send your child to daycare
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.560]   than it does.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.980]   And there's a reason for that expense,
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.820]   because they have to have a certain amount of teachers.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.660]   Like if they're an infant,
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.400]   they need like, I think one teacher
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   for every three or four kids.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.400]   And there's more teachers involved.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.000]   It's all this stuff.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.400]   But in the nine months leading up to having twins,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.840]   I saved every extra cent I could for childcare.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.600]   And I wanted to have like at least one year's worth
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.360]   paid for, so we didn't have to worry about it at the time,
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.600]   'cause I knew it was gonna be expensive.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   I think I looked, our most expensive year,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.160]   we spent almost $40,000 on childcare.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's just a huge,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.160]   like we literally put these kids through college almost.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.920]   So I would say my advice would be as you're having a kid,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.580]   I don't know what your plans are gonna be.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.040]   It's not a bad idea to give yourself a little bit of cushion
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.540]   if you don't have those plans worked out right now.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.320]   - Sounds like good advice.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   I have one follow-up question.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.680]   Can you use credit cards at least to get some points?
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   - Yes, I did use credit cards to get points.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.300]   So that helps a little bit.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.920]   And again, I'm not like asking people to feel sorry for me
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.880]   and complaining, because I think it worked out.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.360]   And I think our kids, like they enjoy,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.740]   like they love going to school.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.580]   On the weekends, they'll be like,
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.400]   "When do we get to go back to school?"
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.880]   They like, they have little friends.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.720]   They've learned a lot.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.000]   So I think it's been good for us and it's worked for us.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.760]   To each their own is my kind of way of thinking about it.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.840]   But it is, it's a huge cost
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.760]   and probably a bigger cost than most people realize.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.360]   No, that's, I think most people
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.280]   would definitely guess less than that.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.760]   But yeah, I've heard from other people and from friends
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.360]   about how expensive childcare is.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.040]   It's incredible.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.160]   - All right, let's do the next one.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   - Okay.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.760]   So up next, is it premature to panic
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.580]   about yield curve inversion?
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.420]   What does the inversion actually mean?
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.160]   I understand that it's more economical
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.140]   to win for shorter periods of time,
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.980]   but what does it mean
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.560]   in the broader context of the economy?
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.280]   - All right, so the risk reward relationship
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.120]   should look like this.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.240]   Longer term bonds, bonds that mature
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   over a longer timeframe, call it 20, 30 years,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.520]   should have higher yields than shorter term bonds,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.180]   call it five years or less.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.000]   Just because there's more interest rate uncertainty,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.080]   which means more volatility.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.800]   So John, pull up this, do a chart on for this first one.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.920]   These are the drawdowns for TLT,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.560]   which is a 20 plus year treasury bond ETF,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.400]   and IEI, which is a three to seven year bond ETF.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.600]   And TLT is down like 28% right now,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.680]   whereas IEI is down more like 10.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.280]   And the yields on these products
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.640]   are fairly similar these days,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   but the losses in long term bonds are way higher
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.000]   'cause volatility is way higher.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.100]   So you think if you're gonna accept that volatility,
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.300]   you wanna be paid to take that risk.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.560]   Now, bond yield spreads are typically used
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.900]   to gauge the health of the economy.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.480]   So let's say wider spreads indicate
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.720]   between long and short term bonds.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.260]   So long term bonds are yielding way more
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.440]   than short term bonds.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.040]   That's called an upward sloping yield curve.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   That would indicate a healthy economic prospects
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.640]   'cause you're thinking there's probably gonna be
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.780]   more inflation and more growth in the future.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.960]   That's what the bond market is telling you.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.520]   Narrower spreads, whether it's flatter or inverted,
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.360]   indicates poor economic prospects,
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.620]   most likely lower growth and inflation
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.080]   because people aren't worried about long term,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.800]   they're worried about it more short term.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.960]   And so you can think of the yield curve
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.220]   as a way to gauge sentiment in the economy.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.280]   Now, this as a signal is still relatively new.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.940]   Campbell Harvey is a professor, I think he's at Duke now.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.620]   He's credited with discovering this in his dissertation.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.340]   I think Josh talked to him a couple years ago.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.180]   - Yeah, we've had him on twice.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.180]   - Okay, so he did his dissertation
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.860]   at University of Chicago back in 1986
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.980]   and he kind of discovered this signal.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.480]   And so he said that people become worried about the economy.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.880]   The 10 year treasury is like the benchmark.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.220]   People think of this as like the safest bond in the world.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.680]   People purchase this bond and that drives rates down
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.620]   and it brings other rates up
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.140]   and it kind of puts it all in.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.680]   So let's look at this, the yield of the 210 spread.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.800]   So this is the 10 year treasury
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.260]   minus the two year treasury.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.000]   And you can see every time it hits that line
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.060]   or goes negative, that just means that the two year
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.380]   is about to surpass the 10 year in yield.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.780]   You can see the gray lines after it is a recession.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.660]   I think Harvey actually used a 10 year
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.140]   in the three month T-bill yield,
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.380]   but it's pretty much the same thing as short term.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.820]   Now, he did say like in his dissertation
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.580]   that the yield curve has to be sustained,
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.620]   this inversion has to be sustained for a full quarter,
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.980]   not just a couple of days.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.420]   So in every time we've had a recession
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.260]   going back to like the 1960s,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.180]   an inverted yield curve has preceded it.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.900]   So it's a pretty good signal.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.860]   I don't know if you wanna do the correlation causation thing
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.740]   where interest rates are predicting a recession
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.220]   or it's just, it's happening because of that.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.380]   Now, I do wanna look at the other side of this
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.540]   'cause, and I know every time you do that,
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.780]   people say, "Oh, so you're saying it's different this time."
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.100]   No, but the market's changed.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.900]   I'm saying markets evolve and like maybe
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.620]   the Fed's involvement in the credit markets
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.780]   has changed things.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.300]   Maybe it means people think the Fed
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.420]   is gonna keep raising rates
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.580]   'cause they say they're going to keep raising rates,
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.220]   but people don't really expect inflation
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.700]   to be a problem in the long term.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.140]   So the short term yields are coming up a lot.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.740]   The only thing I really know is that interest rates
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.900]   are really screwed up right now.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.020]   So I don't know if it's gonna cause a recession or not.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.980]   The thing is, even if it does, let's look at the lag.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.180]   John, throw up this first table.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.500]   This shows like the start of a yield curve inversion
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.660]   and then the start of a recession.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.140]   You can see it's an average of like,
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.580]   call it 16 or 17 months.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.740]   It's when it happens.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.220]   And then let's put the next table up
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.180]   just to show the stock market correction.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.300]   You can see there's a lag for stock market corrections too.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.340]   Sometimes it happens pretty quick.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.620]   Sometimes it takes a while to happen.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.260]   I don't know if I'd use this data to say,
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.860]   "All right, well, we have free and clear for 16 months
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.580]   because people know things now
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.540]   and maybe it'll happen faster
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.500]   or maybe it won't happen at all."
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.580]   So it is a pretty good signal
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.780]   that people are worried in some context.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.740]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.660]   Like that relationship is screwed up right now.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.940]   Does that mean we're for sure gonna go into a recession?
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.020]   I would never say 0% or 100% about anything,
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.980]   but I think it does say that credit markets
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.300]   are pretty screwed up right now.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.100]   That's about as far as I'll take it.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.220]   - Yeah, and with a lot of this stuff,
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.500]   you guys have talked about this before,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.660]   but it's kind of what people make of it too, right?
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.220]   If everyone thinks that it's gonna cause a certain result,
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.140]   then they can make it.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.980]   - I do wonder that.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.580]   But yeah, people say, "But look at the track record.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.420]   It's predicted every..."
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.500]   So you gotta give it the benefit of the doubt, I guess.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.140]   But with the caveat that the Fed has really stepped in
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.940]   more than they were in the past in these things,
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.060]   and maybe that screws things up.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.260]   I don't know.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.220]   - We'll find out. - All right.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.860]   Let's do one more.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.500]   - Okay.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.660]   So up next, "My question comes from a discussion I had
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.540]   with an older coworker about his thoughts on risk.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.700]   Since IRA funds are considered more valuable
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.100]   than funds in a taxable account, generally speaking,
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.300]   most people think they should take less risk with them
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.140]   because you don't want to mess those decisions up.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.740]   My coworker had the opposite thought
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.420]   and said that he viewed those funds
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.240]   as the longest-term funds he had,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.980]   so he takes a small portion, not the whole portfolio,
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.900]   and swings for the fences every once in a while.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.580]   He doesn't check those accounts nearly as often
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.900]   as his taxable ones, so he's not as tempted
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.580]   to sell out if it goes south.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.120]   It got me thinking, is this actually the right way
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.420]   to think about funds in IRA or Roth IRA accounts?"
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.100]   - So we're talking about asset location here in psychology.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   Now, I wanna bring in someone
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.340]   who's had a hot take about this before,
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.020]   Nick Majulie has came on the show before and said,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.700]   "Don't max out your 401(k)."
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.580]   That was Nick's hot take before for asset location
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.340]   'cause it gives you more flexibility.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.380]   Nick, what do you think about this?
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.220]   Do you think it makes sense to,
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.200]   if you're gonna take a swing somewhere,
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.660]   you're gonna speculate, does it make sense to do so
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.280]   in a tax-deferred account?
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.260]   Because then you're not, if you, God forbid,
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.660]   it works out, you're not paying taxes on those gains
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.920]   if you have huge gains.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.760]   What do you think?
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.500]   - Yeah, I mean, the optimal thing to do
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.620]   if you know kind of like your high,
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.420]   you want all your high growth investments
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.140]   to be in a non-taxable account, right?
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.860]   Even if you're saying like, well, if you have bond,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.940]   people say, "Oh, you should put bonds
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.940]   in your non-taxable accounts
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.100]   'cause they're paying you interest throughout the year
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.540]   and you're gonna have to pay taxes on that."
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.380]   Well, that's true.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.500]   But actually, if you just look at the math,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.380]   like the highest growth assets you want tax shielding from
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.980]   'cause the long-term capital gains
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.300]   will completely destroy that,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.180]   any sort of like dividend income or, sorry,
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.460]   interest income you get from the bond.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.820]   And especially with yields as low as they are,
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.100]   there's absolutely almost no reason
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.060]   to put bonds in a non-taxable account.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.060]   However, in this case, I think it makes perfect sense
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.000]   to like swing for the fences.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.060]   I mean, think about what,
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.660]   didn't Peter Thiel get like private stock in an IRA
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.640]   and then it grew to like $5 billion tax-free?
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.480]   It's like one of the greatest schemes ever.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.260]   - Yeah, he's got a $5 billion Roth IRA as well.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.180]   - Yeah, it's like that's the type of stuff
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.740]   where you can get really high growth assets
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.140]   or early equity into one of those things.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.340]   That thing could be a miracle if it works out well.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.980]   I personally don't do that.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.740]   I like just 'cause this, I like to rebalance.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.540]   So all of my accounts are carbon copies of each other.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.220]   So like the stock bond mix, everything,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.900]   I try to make them identical across everything.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.900]   So when I rebalance, I can just rebalance within accounts.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.860]   - So you don't think about like having more of something
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.140]   in one account and then rebalance between accounts.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.580]   I guess that simplification.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.660]   I also think the psychological aspect of it.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.340]   So they asked about like people think
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.120]   they can look more long-term in their long,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.180]   and that's what I think too.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.820]   Like if you're, I don't necessarily swing for the fences,
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.580]   but I know that I have, I don't know, three decades or so.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.040]   So I'm gonna touch that money.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.500]   So to me, it's almost out of sight, out of mind.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.360]   So all of my retirement accounts
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.100]   are completely in risk assets.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.060]   There's no reason for me to, so I take risk there.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.220]   And then I think if I slowly but surely
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.500]   de-risk my portfolio as I get close to retirement
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.700]   or whatever I'm gonna do,
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.440]   then I would add those other funds
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.700]   that I'm gonna be using into taxable accounts
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.200]   because again, I'm gonna let those other ones keep flying.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.040]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.560]   I think this makes complete sense
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.820]   on a behavioral perspective and just technically
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.420]   it's optimal from like a returns perspective as well.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.460]   So keeping those things like out of sight, out of mind,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.300]   it makes perfect sense.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.620]   So I agree with that.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.700]   - All right, let's do the next one.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.260]   - Okay.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.540]   So up next, with individual stocks,
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.340]   I never average down because I tend to think
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.140]   the market knows more about individual companies
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.180]   than I ever could.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.780]   And companies go bankrupt all the time
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.340]   or at least become low valuation junk companies
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.380]   and stay that way for years or decades.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.220]   However, with ETFs, especially index diversified ones,
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.180]   I feel like averaging down is often a great move
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.200]   in the longterm.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.620]   I'd like to think that a well-constructed equity index
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.080]   isn't going to zero unless the world collapses
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.100]   and we'd have a lot more to worry about
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.980]   than our P&L in that case.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.940]   Am I missing something?
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.620]   - Nick, we set it up for you perfectly here.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.100]   I got a copy right here, Nick's new book.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:54.940]   Just keep buying.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.760]   Before we set it up here,
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.540]   I wanna talk about like the individual stock side of things.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.380]   So I look, Nick,
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.620]   have you read the Jeffrey West book "Scale" before?
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.700]   - I'll quote it.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.540]   I'm ready.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.580]   I already know exactly what you're,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.220]   'cause I've quoted, I think in the book,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.260]   but I already kind of know the-
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.900]   - Okay, so I think I, yeah.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.460]   So his stat was like 29,000 companies
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.540]   in the stock market from 1950 to 2009.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.540]   80% of them were gone by 2009
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.820]   from bank buyouts or bankruptcies or mergers.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.700]   He's saying fewer than 5% of companies
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.220]   in the stock market remain over 30-year periods.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.300]   And the estimated half-life of U.S. public companies
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.220]   is 10 1/2 years,
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.300]   meaning half of all companies that go public
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.420]   in any given year will be gone in 10 1/2 years.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.420]   So this line of thinking,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.540]   it's antithetical to Warren Buffett
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.740]   and that sort of thing of like buying a stock
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.560]   when it's on sale.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.460]   But I think for individual companies,
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.420]   if you're not really sure
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.260]   that you have these concentrated companies
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.580]   that you're as sure about as Mr. Buffett is,
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.540]   then yeah, the individual stock side of things,
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.360]   a lot of them just don't come back.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.620]   - Yeah, so I mean, I think the West stat
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.900]   about like half of all public companies
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.900]   are gone every 10 years.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.220]   Just think every 10 years, like half the companies are gone
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.200]   and some brand new half and then another half, right?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   That just keeps happening.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.820]   And then so that's why you have very few companies
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.660]   that make it 50 years.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.620]   I think the other thing that's too,
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.420]   I think I put it in the book was like,
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.900]   by the end of 2020, there was not a single company
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.620]   still in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.180]   that was in there a hundred years prior.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.580]   I think GE was the last one
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.220]   and they had just fallen out, right?
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.120]   I mean, technically Standard Oil became,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.860]   but even Standard Oil wasn't really in it until after 1920.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.740]   So it's like no company has been in there a hundred years.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.660]   And if that doesn't show you kind of like
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.540]   nothing lasts forever, then I don't know what will.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.860]   But yeah, I definitely think like individual stocks,
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.700]   they come and go.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.300]   I think I also had, there's a stat in there.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.300]   I had like OSAM, they have all this data
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.120]   from like the 1970s for Compustat.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.860]   I said, give me the one year median return
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.940]   for any individual stock.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.740]   Let's say you picked a stock at random out of a hat
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.380]   and like, or you sorted all the one year returns
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.720]   of all history of all individual stocks
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.180]   and you just pick the middle one.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.820]   The answer is like 6.3%
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.300]   and the one year median return on the index is like 9%.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.580]   So in expectation, if you just got a random individual stock
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.300]   you're gonna underperform the market, right?
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.980]   And of course there's those exceptional stocks
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.060]   that just crush everything else,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.500]   but there's a lot of stocks that have
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.460]   less than 6.3% one year return.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.700]   So it's still a positive return,
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.780]   but it technically doesn't beat the index, right?
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.320]   - What if you're someone like me who has a process?
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.460]   - I'm saying for some people it works,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.620]   but like, I mean, there's some studies
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.900]   that show only 10% of people have skill, right?
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.680]   - But I think this idea of like thinking more
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.620]   in terms of momentum for individual stocks,
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.580]   but value for indexes makes sense.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.480]   So he's asked, this question is asking,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.140]   and I agree like an index is not gonna go to zero.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.540]   And if it does, then I don't know,
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.580]   aliens attacked or something.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.300]   But I think if aliens attacked,
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.580]   it would actually be positive for the market
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.460]   'cause there'd be huge infrastructure spending.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.580]   But let's say there is a case where
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.340]   like the whole stock market just,
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.980]   like that is when you buy it.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.300]   That's the whole point of your book, right?
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.580]   Is like, especially if you're young and you're a net saver
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.960]   over any period, five, 10 plus years,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.460]   and indexes are falling, like you want them to fall
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.600]   'cause you get to buy at lower valuations
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.700]   and higher dividend yields and lower prices.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.660]   That's a good thing.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.360]   - Yeah, assuming there's a recovery
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.700]   and the world's not coming to an end, I agree.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.420]   I think the other thing to think about here is like,
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.300]   yes, the index, the index is never the same.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.180]   Like when we look at this, oh, S&P 500 over time,
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.820]   we think that's like the same 500 companies.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.500]   It's obviously not because of just what we said with scale,
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.660]   right, with Jeffrey West's stuff.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.980]   But like, because they're always changing
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.620]   the companies in there, you can,
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.140]   it looks like that thing's going up forever,
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.580]   but really this company is coming in and out.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.900]   So really you are a momentum investor.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.060]   If you were on the S&P 500 index,
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.860]   you're a momentum investor without realizing it.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.700]   And that's fine.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.540]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that,
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.220]   but I'm gonna write a post on this and say like,
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.540]   hey, it's very different owning a stock
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.620]   versus owning an index and why and why it's different.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.100]   You really think about kind of what that means.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.300]   - Well, and if you look at the market today,
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.660]   you saw yesterday Netflix was down like 30 or 40% in a day.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.180]   There's all these stocks getting killed
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.260]   and the S&P is down like five or 6%.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.780]   It's not down very much at all.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.280]   And that's like, that's what else you get
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.340]   is just diversification is like,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.780]   it feels like it hasn't mattered for a while
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.100]   because everyone wanted to just own,
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.140]   I just want to own tech stocks.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.900]   But now I feel like the last two years,
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.940]   diversification is finally showing through.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.780]   And that's the great thing about the S&P as well
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.620]   is that we're showing even when these big tech stocks fall,
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.780]   other stocks come up and pick up the slack.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.120]   It doesn't always work like that,
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.900]   but sometimes that diversification
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.700]   is the best part of it too.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.340]   - Yeah, completely agree with that.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.420]   - Okay, so again, check out Nick's book, "Just Keep Buying."
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.780]   He's been on a book tour big time.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.620]   Are you dead at this point?
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.460]   - Over 30, yeah, I think this is like my 33rd podcast.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.300]   I don't know.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.420]   - You answered it, you answered it.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.060]   I did a poll in the chat of if you'd been on more
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.300]   or less than 20 podcasts recently.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.140]   - Oh, okay.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.380]   - So yeah, definitely over.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.540]   - All right, so best and worst part about writing a book.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.660]   Final question here.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.100]   - I think the best part for me
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.620]   was just kind of like organizing my thoughts.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.580]   It's like, what's your, it's like my investment philosophy,
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.140]   like an introduction to investment philosophy.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.700]   That was kind of the best part.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.860]   Worst part, I think it's just like the whole like,
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.340]   there's a supply chain thing.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.780]   And like, there's just a lot of stuff
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.780]   that's happening in the world
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.180]   and like kind of dealing with all that.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.260]   And like, it's like, I wanted to,
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.060]   I originally wanted out by Christmas last year.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.340]   I was like, oh, it'll be a great Christmas gift
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.020]   and it happened and then we had to push it.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.580]   And then supply chain pushed it further.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.820]   So I think that was the only part.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.940]   And it was out of our control.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.780]   It's not my publisher's fault.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.620]   It's no one's fault.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.940]   It's just things you can't control.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.780]   - That is tough.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.980]   When you have the book totally done
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.620]   and there's no more edits,
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.980]   that time and the time it actually gets to people
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.380]   is a lot longer than people think.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.220]   So that is--
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.100]   - Yeah, it was done last July, right?
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.940]   And then the other thing too,
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.740]   so the worst, actually the worst part for me was,
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.460]   so in there I'm talking about inflation a little bit,
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.260]   but remember all the data I had for the book
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.740]   ends in, you know, end of 2020 and inflation was still low.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.860]   So I'm saying like, hey, historically inflation has been low
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.020]   and now it's 8.5%.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.620]   People are reading this like this guy's an idiot.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.540]   Like, well, I didn't know it was gonna go to 8.5.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.540]   Like, I obviously don't know.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.180]   And I still think it's timeless regardless,
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.980]   but I'm saying like, hey, inflation's historically been low.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.020]   Of course it can go up again.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.660]   I talk about how to hedge against inflation and all that,
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.180]   but like, I just look stupid
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.140]   because like the data I had at the time
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.780]   when I was writing this is not the data
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.340]   that people are reading now, right?
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.620]   'Cause there's like a huge lag, right?
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.060]   - That just means in 10 years you can do second edition
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.900]   and update the numbers.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.900]   - Yeah, exactly, and add that, yeah.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.940]   - Perfect.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.900]   - You always gotta leave room for a sequel.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.740]   - Yeah.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.580]   - There you go.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.060]   Thanks to Nick for coming on.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.340]   Check out the new threads we got.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.580]   Duncan just updated the compound store.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.580]   I got a new T-shirt today.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.740]   Very nice, high quality.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.560]   I love it.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.780]   We just got some portfolio rescue towels in the office.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.260]   I think they look like flags, so you can hang 'em up.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.660]   - I didn't even realize we did, oh my God.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.460]   - Yeah, we've got blue and red portfolio rescue towels.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.340]   Got one, Duncan?
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.020]   Pretty sweet, actually.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.340]   They're very nice.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.500]   High quality, I like 'em.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.420]   I'm gonna buy some of those for the lake this summer.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.780]   - Can't wait, so check out idontshop.com.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.800]   We also have the Ben Doesn't Drink Coffee mug,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.120]   I think it's called there, right?
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.960]   - Yep, that's always there.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.580]   - Keep those comments and questions coming.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.780]   Remember, pick up a copy of Nick's book.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.020]   Amazon, anywhere you can find it, just keep buying.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.700]   Have a question, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.540]   and we'll be answering your questions again next week.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.460]   See you then.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.300]   - See ya.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:57.880]   [Music]
