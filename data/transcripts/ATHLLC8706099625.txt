[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Hey everyone, we have big plans for All The Hacks next year and I'd really appreciate
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080]   your help by taking a quick survey at allthehacks.com/survey.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.160]   It would mean so much to me and as a thank you we're giving away three $100 Viore gift
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.960]   cards, one Any Day, Every Day cookware set, and a free Round Trip United certificate anywhere
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.480]   in North America.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.240]   We're selecting winners next week so get your responses in soon.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.880]   Place in advance and enjoy the show.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.520]   Hello and welcome to a special bonus episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.360]   life, money, and travel.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   I'm your host Chris Hutchins and today this bonus episode is going to be my holiday gift
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   guide.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.780]   I'd planned to get this out in early December but a few of the things on this list were
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.680]   on sale for Black Friday so I rushed to get it out today.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.160]   But because it's a bonus episode you'll still be getting another episode tomorrow all about
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.760]   optimizing your tax advantaged accounts which was so great.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.880]   So what we're going to do today is run down some of my favorite products, gifts, and past
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.600]   purchases that might make good ideas for gifts for you or your loved ones this holiday season.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.680]   So I'll break them down to these six sections.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.880]   First I'll do home and food, then tech and gear, then clothes and bags, followed by health
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.120]   and fitness, then family and kids, and finally books and learning.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.340]   Then I'll wrap with a quick recap at the end on how to make sure you get the best deals
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.280]   this holiday season.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.440]   Also you should know that none of the products or services I put in this gift guide have
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.840]   paid me to be a part of this list.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.440]   However, some of them are sponsors of all the hacks but that makes sense because as
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.000]   I've said before most of my sponsors are here because I reached out to them after already
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.500]   loving their products.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.320]   In fact for any of the companies I'm about to talk about who aren't sponsors I will certainly
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.720]   be adding them to the list of brands to reach out to in 2024 to see if they want to work
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.960]   together, which actually happened for at least one brand from last year's gift guide which
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.080]   was pretty cool.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.380]   Also while I normally create an allthehacks.com/shortlink for a lot of the deals and things that I share
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.920]   on the show to make it easy for you to find, there would just be way too many links for
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.080]   this episode.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.360]   So I'm only going to mention the URLs if there's a specific discount, but I will put every
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.600]   single link to everything in the show notes and in the written version of this gift guide
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.620]   which is linked in the show notes, but you can also find it at any time at allthehacks.com/gifts.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.100]   And since a few of these links though certainly not all of them are from sponsors or our referral
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.840]   links or affiliate links to sites like Amazon, I would greatly appreciate if you go to the
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.680]   show notes or to allthehacks.com/gifts and click the links there to support me and the
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   show that is unless you find a better price elsewhere in which case absolutely go there
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.680]   instead and maybe let me know and I'll go update that gift guide for everyone else.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   Okay, let's get into the 2023 gift guide right after this.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.700]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much more,
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.320]   harder as you build your wealth.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.640]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.460]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.960]   from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.400]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.920]   I've loved being a part of the community and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.280]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative investments.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.080]   Now the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young, highly successful
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.480]   individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn from each other in a confidential,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.960]   unbiased setting.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.680]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.440]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because you're
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.400]   getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on everything from
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.840]   your investment portfolio to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.440]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.720]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum for membership,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.280]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle and it's totally free to join.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.460]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.480]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.320]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.720]   This episode is brought to you by K-18.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.040]   You might not realize it, but most people have damaged hair.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.680]   Luckily you can reverse the damage from the inside out with K-18.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.200]   Powered by biotech, the patented technology works in just four minutes.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   You may have heard of this viral mask on TikTok.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.240]   Plus, it's won tons of awards and stylists love it.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.560]   Buy it today at Sephora and salons nationwide.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.680]   Or to get 10% off your first order, head to k18hair.com and use the code podcast10.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.400]   Okay, I'm going to start with the home and food section.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.640]   And this first gift is a Coravin.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.560]   And this was the number one clicked gift in last year's newsletter gift guide.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.480]   So I thought I'd mention it again because there are plenty of nights where Amy or I
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.180]   or both of us want to have a glass of wine with dinner, but we don't really want to finish
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.560]   the entire bottle.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.680]   So we used to just skip the wine or end up trying to finish the whole bottle.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.960]   And then we got a Coravin as a gift and it changed everything.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.240]   It's a device with a small hollow needle that pierces through the cork, lets you pour out
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.120]   wine and replace the space that wine took up with argon gas to keep your wine fresh
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120]   for the future.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.360]   And it looks like right now you can get up to 40% off for Black Friday, which I'll make
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.920]   sure to link to in the show notes or on the written guide at allthehacks.com/gifts.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   Next is any day cookware.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.060]   And after interviewing chef David Chang in episode 122, I was convinced to start cooking
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.600]   more in the microwave and we haven't looked back.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.160]   We've made David Chang's salmon rice in our any day countless times in the microwave and
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.360]   it is so good every time.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.660]   I'm also a big fan of David's book cooking at home, which would also make a great gift.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.080]   And you can get 15% off any day at allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.160]   Or this is one brand where if you're an All The Hacks member, you can actually get 20%
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.960]   off with the link in the member site.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.880]   And if you're interested in joining, you can go to allthehacks.com/join.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.120]   Next is an OXO bench scraper, and I can't remember how a podcast episode about finding
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   a job and negotiating compensation included the recommendation for this product.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.000]   But now we have a bench scraper in the kitchen and we use it all the time for scooping up
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.260]   vegetables, scraping off the counters.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.240]   We even have a non-metal version, which is a little bit more delicate that we use for
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.320]   scraping all the food mess our kids leave on the dining room table.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.160]   Next is the Ember mug, which I think we've gifted an Ember mug almost half a dozen times
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   now and we have two in our kitchen.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.600]   They're fantastic at keeping coffee warm all morning or maybe all day if you're a really
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.880]   slow drinker and their customer service is fantastic.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   There are some great Black Friday prices that I'll also link to right now.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.080]   And for putting it in that cup, you should really check out Trade Coffee.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.400]   Based on the smile that shows up on Amy's face every time she opens up a package from
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.040]   Trade, I feel confident saying that this would make an amazing gift for any coffee lover.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.200]   We've gifted it multiple times and with every delivery, the recipient's going to get a new
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.760]   curated bag of beans from the top independent roasters around the country.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.800]   Best of all, you can get your first bag free and up to 30% off at allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.640]   Next is the Zolto Denart Universal Wine Glass.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.160]   Now these glasses are not cheap, but we were gifted a set of them a few years ago and we
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.960]   absolutely love them.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.740]   I know when you first see the price, it seems absolutely crazy, but I'll link to an article
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.040]   from a skeptical Bon Appetit writer who also agreed just as we do that wine really does
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.720]   taste better out of them.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.780]   But if you're looking for a gift that's more about cocktails than wine, I definitely want
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.460]   to recommend the Death & Co Cocktail Books.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.000]   If you live in New York, you've probably been to Death & Co for a cocktail, but their books
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.400]   look so great on the coffee table, but they are also fantastic recipe guides for making
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   drinks.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.240]   My favorite is Cocktail Codex, which focuses on six root cocktails you can master that
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.040]   really give you the knowledge to make almost any drink.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.840]   And finally in this category is the Paprika app.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.760]   I know I've mentioned this app multiple times because I think it's the best way to organize
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.840]   recipes and meal planning.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.080]   However, because it's a bit pricey, I think it could make a great gift.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   But if you really want to level up that gift, you could actually use it to curate all your
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.040]   favorite recipes and share that export with whoever you gift it to and start them off
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.880]   with an amazing recipe catalog.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.360]   And until the end of November, all of their apps are on sale for 40% off.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.480]   Moving on to the tech and gear category, I'm going to start with standing desks.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.520]   With so many of us working from home, it's such a nice luxury to have a standing desk
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.960]   in my home office, and we actually just got one for Amy as well.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.200]   They used to be very, very expensive, but I'm a big fan of Uplift Desk, which has some
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.280]   reasonably priced options and a Black Friday sale right now.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.960]   That said, for Amy, we actually just picked up a Trisanti standing desk for even less
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.500]   at Costco, and it is fantastic as well.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.560]   Next I want to talk about the Sense Energy Monitor.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.160]   After episode 135 on Home Energy, I was so excited to dive into the data from our Sense
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   even more to try to make our home much more efficient.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.200]   It's a small device that you can attach at your circuit breaker and monitors everything
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.400]   going on in your house and uses a lot of smart detection to identify devices so that you
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.280]   can see how much each device is using.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.600]   It's not quite as cool as the Span Electrical Panel, which has been on my list for years,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.000]   but given that the Sense is about 1% of the price, I am pretty happy with it right now.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.080]   And you can get 20% off for Black Friday, which I'll link to in the show notes.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.400]   Keeping in the theme of smart home, I've played around with a lot of devices over the years,
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.520]   but none have worked more consistently or stood the test of time than our Lutron Caseta
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.960]   light dimmers.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.640]   With a Lutron Hub, you can connect them to Apple Home or any other smart home platform,
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.720]   and they just work.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   They're so reliable.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.540]   I haven't seen them go on sale, but I still highly recommend them.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.240]   Last is a new addition to our house from just a few days ago, which is the Samsung Frame
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   TV.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.520]   Now I'm not usually one for really nice fancy TVs, and the last three or four we bought
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:43.280]   have all been very inexpensive TCL TVs from Target or Walmart, but last week we bought
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.440]   a Samsung Frame TV and we love it.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.880]   Between the matte display and when you get a bezel that isn't black, it really does look
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.520]   like art instead of a TV, which is a really great change for our living room.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.760]   The Black Friday deals on Samsung's website and all over the internet right now are great,
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.360]   but they are even better when you stack them with an employee discount, which you can get
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.560]   if you find someone who has access to many different perk sites like Perks at Work or
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   Perksbot, and even better, you can stack that discount with cashback from Rakuten, which
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.080]   I'll talk about more at the end of this episode.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.880]   Oh, and also at Samsung.com, there is a chase offer depending on your card for 15 to 20%
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.880]   off.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.560]   I think it's only up to about $50, but that stacks as well.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.660]   So when we got our TV, we got the employee price plus the credit card points plus the
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:40.120]   Rakuten cashback plus the chase offer, brought the whole price for the TV down 40% from regular
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.680]   pricing, which is amazing.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.560]   If you aren't able to get an employee discount, there is also a great price going on right
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.660]   now at Costco with a few extra perks.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.540]   Next I want to talk about headphones and I'm sure you're all expecting me to be talking
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:58.120]   about AirPods, but actually no, I want to talk about Shox, which makes my new favorite
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.480]   wireless headphones for running and any other time when I actually want to be a little bit
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.360]   more aware because they're actually open ear.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.920]   So you can hear what's going on around you, or in my case, you can actually just have
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.280]   a conversation with the person you're going on a run with.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.200]   Amy and I have been using the Shox Open Run Pros and Open Fits for almost six months and
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.760]   absolutely love them.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:25.080]   I am still a huge fan of the native integration you get when using your AirPods, but anytime
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.240]   I'm doing something active, I prefer Shox, but both Shox and AirPods all have really
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.360]   great Black Friday sales right now that I'll link to.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.100]   And on the Apple note, now that we have kids and we're checking bags all the time, I always
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.080]   make sure to keep air tags in all of our checked bags.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.660]   I haven't needed them, but being able to see where your bags are, see that they made it
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.840]   on your plane, see them at your destination just gives me a lot of comfort.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.520]   And right now they're on sale for Black Friday as well.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.600]   Next category is clothes and bags.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.760]   I'm going to start with my absolute favorite clothing brand.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   It's what I wear all the time and that's Viore.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.400]   They are ridiculously comfy.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.080]   Amy and I wear them pretty much every single day.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.200]   I love the Sunday Performance Joggers, the Tech Tees, but the partner I work with at
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.360]   Viore said I absolutely have to check out the Range Shirt Jacket, which I think could
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.120]   make a great gift this year.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:23.360]   But honestly, you couldn't go wrong with anything they make and you can get 20% off at allthehacks.com/vuori.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.600]   Next is the Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket, which has been the go-to jacket for our family.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.280]   It's incredibly warm, very thin and packs down to almost nothing so you can take it
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   everywhere.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.400]   They're also very easy to wash, which helps with kids.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.880]   And I haven't found a great deal for Black Friday yet, but depending on the color you
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.760]   want, you can often find really, really great deals.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.280]   Next is Stance socks.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.760]   We've tried a lot of sock brands and some of them seem to always fall apart, but day-to-day
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.720]   use, wear and tear wise, we're huge fans of Stance.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.360]   They're durable, super comfortable and come in so many great colors and patterns.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.200]   They're great stocking stuffers and they have a cyber sale right now for up to 40% off.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.600]   Finally, two recommendations from Amy specifically.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.480]   One is the Arizona Waterproof Birkenstocks.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.340]   She has a couple pairs of these and the wearability is super versatile.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.600]   She wears them to the park, the beach, brunch, pool, gardening, running errands, pretty much
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   everywhere.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.000]   They're waterproof, easy to clean, really comfortable and super budget friendly.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.120]   She's a big fan and I'm pretty sure we even have a pair for the kids as well.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.240]   And last is Dagny Dover bags.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.280]   I think Amy has given Dagny Dover bags as a gift more than anything else.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.000]   Her favorites are the Landon Carryall and the Dakota Backpack, though I've seen her
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.280]   give a couple Dagny Dover fanny packs recently.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.660]   I don't see them on sale right now, but Amy does have a referral link that she would love
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.480]   it if you want to use to get $20 off.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.840]   That's allthehacks.com/dagnydover.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.680]   Moving into health and fitness, I know I've mentioned my Aura Ring a lot, but it's the
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.240]   one thing that I'm always wearing every single day to track sleep, workouts, heart rate,
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   HRV.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.760]   The Gen 3 even tracks your blood oxygen levels.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.400]   I've been trying to partner with Aura for a while.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.760]   It hasn't happened yet, but I did get them to send me a link for up to $100 off this
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   holiday season, which is at allthehacks.com/aura.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.040]   Next is a book called Outlive, the Science and Art of Longevity from Peter Atiyah.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.600]   I'm a huge fan of Peter's podcast and I've had this book pre-ordered since the moment
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.800]   it was announced.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.680]   It is a very long book.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.800]   You can definitely flip around and find the parts you want to read, but I'm guessing that
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.720]   since we can all agree time is one of our most valuable resources, a book about getting
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   more of that back seems well worth the read.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.780]   I totally loved this one.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.640]   Next is a Henson razor.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.200]   We actually started working with most of our sponsors after I used and loved their products
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.360]   and then reached out to them, but Henson was a little bit different.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.160]   They reached out to me and asked if they could be a sponsor.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.440]   I was a little skeptical.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.880]   I already had a shaving routine in place, but after spending a few weeks shaving with
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.960]   a Henson razor on one side and a regular cartridge on the other, I was totally convinced.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.160]   Not to mention it's a gorgeous razor with blades that only cost three to $5 a year,
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160]   so you're actually going to save money.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.480]   If you go to allthehacks.com/henson and use the code ALLTHEHACKS, you'll get two years
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.960]   of blades free with your order.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   Next is levels.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.500]   Now I learned so much about my metabolic health wearing a continuous glucose monitor from
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.120]   levels and tracking how my blood sugar reacted to different foods that I ended up getting
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.760]   Amy one too, and she thought it was so fascinating.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.160]   We made a bunch of changes and thankfully for me, it seems like cinnamon really limits
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.880]   my blood sugar spikes.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.520]   So I am partaking in my fair share of cinnamon rolls during the holidays and feeling much
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.840]   better about it.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.240]   You can get a hundred dollars off for Black Friday right now, which I'll link to as well.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.880]   Next is Hydro Flask.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.400]   So we have an entire shelf dedicated to our growing supply of these water bottles and
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   use them daily.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.760]   In fact, we finally just decided to purge all non Hydro Flask water bottles in the house
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.000]   because these have just become our favorites.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.160]   They have great kids and adult sizes with tons of color options and they're always running
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.680]   sales, but I don't see anything for Black Friday yet.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.260]   Next in the family and kids section, I want to start with family stuff.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.760]   First is story worth.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.600]   If you've ever wanted to capture all the stories and memories from your loved ones, this makes
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.300]   a great gift.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.360]   Every week for a year, story worth will email your loved one a single life related question
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.840]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done or the furthest you've traveled, and
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.200]   they get compiled at the end of the year into a hardcover book that you can pass down for
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.920]   generations and you can get $10 off at all the hacks.com/story worth.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.700]   The aura photo frame is a digital photo frame we've had in our house for a while, but recently
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.400]   we've given it as a gift to my parents and I think everyone on Amy's side of the family
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.760]   has one too.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.920]   And it's so seamless to share photos with everyone that we're constantly passing photos
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.120]   around the family.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.360]   They also have a Black Friday sale going on, which is great.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.680]   Next is one of my favorite things to do with family over the holidays, and that is an escape
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   room.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.040]   I don't have a specific recommendation because it varies all around the country or even the
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.880]   world, but Amy and I have probably done 50 of these and anytime we have family around
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.760]   or we're visiting, we try to find one to do with the family and friends.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.000]   I highly recommend it if it's not something you do regularly.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.220]   And if you're looking to find one locally, thanks to Drew and Carrie who sent in a recommendation
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.560]   to use the Morty app, which has a directory of almost every escape room.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.920]   But speaking of escape rooms, a friend of mine worked with Neil Patrick Harris to develop
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.180]   this amazing game called Box One that you can use at home.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.960]   It's a solo one player, I guess, board game and I don't really know how to explain it,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.880]   but anyone you know who likes puzzles or escape rooms will love this.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.480]   I personally thought it was amazing.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.120]   The company my friend runs that produced the game is called Theory 11 and they also sell
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.900]   the most beautiful playing cards in the world.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.400]   You just have to go to their site and see them to understand what I mean, but they have
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.720]   so many collections from Star Wars to Harry Potter, James Bond, Notorious B.I.G. and a
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.880]   lot more.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.680]   They make the best stocking stuffers and Theory 11 also sells an endless supply of amazing
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.320]   and high quality magic tricks if anyone in your family is interested in magic.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.520]   But if you want Box One or the Star Wars playing card box set, you can use the code AllTheHacks23
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.640]   to get 20% off.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.480]   Next is something we've now given to all four of our parents, which is a subscription to
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.520]   Delete Me.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.280]   As you probably know from listening to this show, it's crazy how many sites sell and share
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.160]   your personal data and it's a huge pain to get them all to take it down.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.520]   Delete Me does all of this for you and it's not the sexiest, coolest gift to give someone,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.320]   but it's so cool to be able to Google all of our parents and not find their information
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.560]   online anymore.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.240]   You can get 20% off at AllTheHacks.com/DeleteMe.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.800]   In the kids section, I'm going to start with something that our girls wake up every morning
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.680]   and immediately start using and that's a Tony Box.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   Just think of a small speaker that has a bunch of characters you can put on top and they
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.760]   start playing stories, but you can also create your own custom stories and upload them to
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   your own custom Tonys.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   It keeps them entertained for hours and the best part is it doesn't involve a screen and
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.100]   Black Friday sale is up to 30% off.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.380]   Then we have jelly cat stuffed animals.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.800]   Our girls' favorite little friends are their jelly cat plushies.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.160]   They're high quality, super soft and huggable.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.720]   I love the assortment of animals and foods and everything jelly cat makes.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.120]   I'll link to them in the show notes.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.240]   Also our kids love their little sleepies jammies.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.620]   These PJs are hands down our girls' favorites.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.760]   They're made from bamboo viscose, so they're buttery soft, breathable and stretchy and
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.560]   last much longer than some standard PJs.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.340]   They also have a ton of fun prints and colors.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.520]   They're doing a 30% off sale right now if you use the promo code LSFAM.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.800]   Next is Lovevery.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.320]   We've had a subscription to Lovevery since our first daughter was born.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.280]   They make these beautiful award-winning Montessori inspired toys and they send them in a box
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.960]   to your home every two to three months.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.920]   All the toys are designed by child development experts.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.080]   They're well built and sustainably made.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.440]   I haven't seen a sale yet.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.560]   I don't think I've ever gotten a sale, but if you want $20 off your subscription, you
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.680]   can use my referral link allthehacks.com/lovevery.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.640]   This is one of the coolest stories of a gift on this list and that is backpacks from 50/50
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.160]   Gear, which are fantastic for going out with the kids.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.800]   The reason this is so cool is because one of the founders, Adam, is an All The Hacks
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.560]   listener who actually heard me talk about checking your state's unclaimed money website
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.160]   to see if you're owed anything and ended up finding $5,000.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.560]   He used that money to help get this company off the ground and to say thank you, he created
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.000]   a promo code, All The Hacks, for anyone listening to get 10% off their order.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.680]   We have one of these bags and it's become our go-to bag for going out with the kids.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.060]   Next is a repeat from last year, but I guess that's fair because I've actually had to buy
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.080]   this stroller twice because we left it on the sidewalk and drove off without it and
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.000]   that's the Baby's End Yo-Yo.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.600]   It's such a good travel stroller and this is coming from someone, me, who built a spreadsheet
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.340]   to compare over 50 strollers.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.140]   If you like the toffee color, you can get 20% off right now for Black Friday, otherwise
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.420]   I haven't seen another deal yet.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.220]   And finally for kids is the Nanit Baby Monitor.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.100]   You probably need to know someone incredibly well or maybe even be married to them to get
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.540]   them a baby monitor as a gift, but the Nanit is such a great product that I feel like I
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.580]   need to include it on this list.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.220]   It even has a split screen mode if you want to watch two kids at once and it's an FSA
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.220]   eligible expense.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.260]   So if you have FSA dollars to spend before year end, it's a great option.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.380]   Even better, you can get 30% off for their Black Friday sale right now.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.900]   And the last section is on learning.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.100]   First off, obviously if anyone in your family or any of your friends or colleagues love
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.660]   to learn, my number one tip is to send them the All The Hacks podcast or newsletter, of
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:12.180]   course, but if you're looking for gifts that aren't this podcast, I'm going to start first
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.500]   with the book Die With Zero, and I think anyone listening to this show has heard me mention
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.020]   it many times.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.660]   And the reason I keep bringing it up is because it had such a huge impact on the way I think
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.380]   about life and money that I felt it had to be on this list.
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.380]   And it's a book that I've gifted multiple times.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.820]   Next is Masterclass.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.580]   I know I could spend hours watching all the classes they have, and I'm confident Masterclass
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.540]   makes a good gift because I actually gave one to my dad last year.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.380]   There's something for everyone, and you can get two memberships for the price of one right
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.900]   now at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.740]   Next is the Bucket List Journal.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.100]   I had Ben Nimton join me on episode 36, who wrote this book to talk about bucket lists,
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.660]   audacious goals, and living the life you truly want.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.020]   And to help people actually achieve those goals, Ben wrote this book, but it's really
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:09.020]   more of a journal with some inspiration, but a lot of room for you to track your lists,
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.740]   write down some tangible steps you can take towards your goals so you will ultimately
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   achieve them.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.460]   Next, I actually have three books that I haven't read yet, but that really bubbled up to the
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.580]   top of recommendation lists from this year.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.020]   One is When Breath Becomes Air.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.420]   Sahil Bloom has now been on the podcast three times, though that third episode has not come
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.420]   out yet.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.660]   And during our conversations, he said that this was his most gifted book.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.660]   And while I haven't read it, I trust Sahil's advice so much that I'm putting it on the
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.940]   guide and hopefully I will share a review as soon as I read it.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.540]   Next is Same As Ever, a guide to what never changes by Morgan Housel.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.540]   I am a huge fan of Morgan's writing.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.820]   I loved his last book, Psychology of Money, and I've had a chance to interview him on
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.940]   that book and it was such a good interview.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.060]   And it's probably why I'm so excited to read his latest book that came out this month.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.020]   I should be having him on the podcast early next year to talk about it.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.180]   So if reading his new book brings out any questions you want to ask Morgan, please share
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.280]   them with me and I will ask him.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.340]   And last is a book called 4000 Weeks.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.820]   I recently actually hosted a member discussion for all the Hacks members on the book Die
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:22.100]   With Zero and that concept of maximizing your net fulfillment instead of your net worth.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.320]   And one of the top recommendations was to check out the book 4000 Weeks.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.260]   So it's on my list as well.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.500]   I haven't read any of those last three books, so I can't fully endorse them.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.620]   But if they look good to you or you're excited about them, they might make some really great
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.620]   gifts.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.420]   So those are all my recommendations for gifts.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.380]   I do want to talk about how to save money on anything you're shopping for this holiday
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.460]   season.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:49.020]   But first I'll just remind you again that all the links for everything I just mentioned
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.420]   are in the show notes.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.780]   They're at all the hacks.com/gifts and using the links in all of those places is a huge
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.300]   way to support us in the show this holiday season.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.420]   So thanks in advance for doing that.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.940]   So when it comes to shopping online, there's three big ways I like to save.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.900]   One is using cashback portals.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.020]   I always start at Cashback Monitor to see the best way to earn cashback or points shopping
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.220]   online.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:18.500]   For example, there are sometimes places where Rakuten, which is often my default site, doesn't
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.620]   earn as many points as using something like the American Airline Shopping Portal or another
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   platform.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.980]   There are some platforms that get listed on Cashback Monitor that seem to have higher
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.420]   rates than you would think.
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.260]   And once you click into them, you realize, oh, well, I've got to go buy a gift card and
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.620]   I can only buy up to $100, so it's a little complicated.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.100]   But in general, Rakuten, Top Cashback, all the credit card and airline portals are all
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.620]   pretty straightforward.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.780]   But at the end of the day, there's one reason why I love Rakuten more than any other shopping
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.220]   portal, if it has the best rate.
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.340]   And that's because you can take all the cash back and convert it directly to American Express
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.340]   Points.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:03.260]   So instead of earning 10% back, you can earn 10 American Express Points per dollar.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.700]   And given that I'm usually able to get anywhere from one and a half all the way up to five
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:13.980]   cents per point with my Amex points, that takes a 10% cash back to anywhere from 15
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.800]   to 50% cash back.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.540]   So definitely a big fan of cash back with Rakuten.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.580]   We just used it on that Samsung TV I talked about.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.180]   And if you haven't signed up for Rakuten, you can actually get $40 free after your first
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:32.500]   purchase right now using my referral link at allthehacks.com/rakuten.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.740]   Next is finding promo codes and discounts.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.420]   I feel like it's been pretty difficult nowadays to find working promo codes online.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.940]   A lot of the sites that used to share them now are really sharing these referral links
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.140]   and affiliate links in disguise.
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.780]   And so one, you have to be extra careful here, because if you're using a cash back portal,
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:57.060]   sometimes the links through those portals end up overriding your shopping portal tracking.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.020]   So you'll want to make sure that you refresh and double check.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.620]   I will check sites like RetailMeNot or tools like Honey to find a promo code.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.020]   It doesn't work as often.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:11.460]   What I now do a lot more often is just ask the live chat on the website if there's a
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.460]   discount.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.760]   Very often I've found live chat really helpful to be able to get promos or discounts on a
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   shopping card.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.700]   So you can definitely try that.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.420]   Another great way to get discounts is just look at all the offers you see from Amex,
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.440]   Chase, CapOne, whatever your card company is.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.280]   When you log onto any of those banking websites, you'll be able to add offers to your cards.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.260]   And sometimes there's offers for things that are totally irrelevant to you and you're not
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.600]   going to be purchasing.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.760]   But sometimes there's really broad ones like right now, because on Saturday is small business
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:49.480]   Saturday, most Amex cards will have a $5 off $50 as long as you use your card to buy something
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.040]   from a small business.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.600]   But there are so, so many offers in the Amex portal that it can be a little bit hard to
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.800]   manage and sometimes hard to browse.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.020]   Keep in mind that there are often more offers than you'll see.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:07.680]   So for example, right now on my Amex Platinum, I have 345 offers added to my Amex Platinum
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   card.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.480]   And one other thing is once you add an offer to one card, you often can't add it to the
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.600]   other card.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.040]   So when there've been some really, really amazing offers on things that you buy regularly,
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.280]   and you wish that you had it on multiple cards, so you could use the offer over and over again,
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.960]   the way to get around that is either to try to open it in two windows and click it at
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.640]   the exact same time, which seems very difficult, or use a product like Card Pointers.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   Card Pointers is a mobile app to manage all of your credit cards, all of your earning.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.340]   You don't even have to sync to your banks to use it.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.220]   But they have a browser extension that will auto add all of the offers on Amex and Chase
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.960]   to your account without you having to do anything.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.560]   And best of all, they'll hit the Amex and Chase API for all your cards at the same time.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.520]   So you can actually end up adding those offers to multiple cards at once.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.280]   So definitely go in and look at those offers in advance to make sure you're using the right
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.980]   card to get a deal this holiday season.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.160]   And also on Saturday, definitely make sure that if you're shopping at any local businesses
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.080]   to add that $5 off $50 to get a little extra discount.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.720]   Finally, the third category is gift cards.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.480]   Most retailers online don't qualify for any elevated bonus points like you would get for
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.240]   travel or dining or groceries.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.640]   So one tactic I love when I'm buying something from a retailer is buying gift cards for that
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.760]   retailer somewhere where I earn more than two points per dollar.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:36.660]   So that could be four points at the grocery store with an Amex Gold or 5% back on Amazon.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:41.640]   Or if you have a card that earns a lot of points at gas stations or office supply stores,
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.840]   they often sell gift cards as well.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   So those are three tactics for saving money online this holiday season.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.000]   I really hope that's helpful and I hope that some of these gifts were helpful.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.040]   If you have any recommendations either now or later for other gifts you think would make
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.080]   great addition to this guide, let me know.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   Some of the things on this list were added because people sent them to me last year.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.960]   So even though I might not get to share it for another 12 months, I would love to see
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.640]   your recommendations.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.300]   Also a lot of these are things that I've already gotten and I'm getting hit up from family
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.200]   for things that I might need for Christmas.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   So I would love your recommendations if you think there's something I should put on my
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.520]   list as well.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.800]   Thank you so much for listening to this bonus episode.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.400]   If you know anyone that you think would enjoy it, please consider sharing it with them.

[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.040]   has made it possible for All The Hacks to become my full time endeavor.
