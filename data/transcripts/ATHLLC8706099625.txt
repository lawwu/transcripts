[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.080]   - Hello, and welcome to a special bonus episode
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080]   of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.920]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.800]   and today this bonus episode
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.360]   is going to be my holiday gift guide.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.520]   I'd planned to get this out in early December,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.240]   but a few of the things on this list
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.960]   were on sale for Black Friday,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.080]   so I rushed to get it out today.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.760]   But because it's a bonus episode,
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.200]   you'll still be getting another episode tomorrow
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.740]   all about optimizing your tax-advantaged accounts,
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.160]   which was so great.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.280]   So what we're gonna do today
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   is run down some of my favorite products, gifts,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.520]   and past purchases that might make good ideas
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.060]   for gifts for you or your loved ones this holiday season.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.920]   So I'll break them down to these six sections.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.480]   First, I'll do home and food,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.280]   then tech and gear,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.840]   then clothes and bags,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.280]   followed by health and fitness,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.600]   then family and kids,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600]   and finally, books and learning.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.800]   Then I'll wrap with a quick recap at the end
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.000]   on how to make sure you get the best deals
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.580]   this holiday season.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.980]   Also, you should know that none of the products
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.880]   or services I put in this gift guide
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.320]   have paid me to be a part of this list.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.360]   However, some of them are sponsors of all the hacks,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.280]   but that makes sense because as I've said before,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.160]   most of my sponsors are here
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.720]   because I reached out to them
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.960]   after already loving their products.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.720]   In fact, for any of the companies
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.120]   I'm about to talk about who aren't sponsors,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.640]   I will certainly be adding them
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   to the list of brands to reach out to in 2024
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.880]   to see if they want to work together,
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.180]   which actually happened for at least one brand
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.420]   from last year's gift guide, which was pretty cool.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.980]   Also, while I normally create
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.060]   an allthehacks.com/shortlink
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.620]   for a lot of the deals and things that I share on the show
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.500]   to make it easy for you to find,
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.560]   there would just be way too many links for this episode.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.460]   So I'm only gonna mention the URLs
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.640]   if there's a specific discount,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.740]   but I will put every single link
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.820]   to everything in the show notes
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.260]   and in the written version of this gift guide,
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.520]   which is linked in the show notes,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.940]   but you can also find it at any time
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.100]   at allthehacks.com/gifts.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.300]   And since a few of these links,
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.660]   though certainly not all of them,
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.140]   are from sponsors or are referral links
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.460]   or affiliate links to sites like Amazon,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.140]   I would greatly appreciate if you go to the show notes
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.500]   or to allthehacks.com/gifts
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.020]   and click the links there to support me and the show.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.380]   That is unless you find a better price elsewhere,
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860]   in which case, absolutely go there instead.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.060]   And maybe let me know
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.360]   and I'll go update that gift guide for everyone else.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.340]   Okay, let's get into the 2023 gift guide right after this.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.720]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.120]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.000]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.140]   for a good hang.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.200]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.160]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.100]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.040]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.800]   take care of the supplies.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.620]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.480]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.900]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.860]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.340]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.420]   that you got through another week.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.520]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.060]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.820]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.920]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.580]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.160]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.140]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.160]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.000]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.060]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.700]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.180]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.820]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.120]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.140]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.380]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.500]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.000]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.580]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.020]   in your situation,
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.620]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.900]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.740]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.900]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.980]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.420]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.820]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.820]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.100]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.240]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.600]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.320]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   are first generation wealth,
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.200]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.340]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.680]   and learn from each other
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.280]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.580]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.900]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.320]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.460]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.940]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.360]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.720]   to your children's education
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.020]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.480]   So many of these conversations
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.360]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.220]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.400]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.460]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.600]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.120]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.060]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.620]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E dot com.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.460]   Okay, I'm gonna start with the home and food section,
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.820]   and this first gift is a Coravin,
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.860]   and this was the number one clicked gift
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.740]   in last year's newsletter gift guide,
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.300]   so I thought I'd mention it again
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.580]   because there are plenty of nights
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580]   where Amy or I or both of us
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.380]   wanna have a glass of wine with dinner,
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.780]   but we don't really wanna finish the entire bottle.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.700]   So we used to just skip the wine
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.860]   or end up trying to finish the whole bottle,
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.540]   and then we got a Coravin as a gift
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.120]   and it changed everything.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.300]   It's a device with a small hollow needle
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.820]   that pierces through the cork,
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.060]   lets you pour out wine,
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.220]   and replace the space that wine took up
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.660]   with argon gas to keep your wine fresh for the future.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.060]   It looks like right now you can get up to 40% off
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.180]   for Black Friday,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.260]   which I'll make sure to link to in the show notes
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.860]   or on the written guide at allthehacks.com/gifts.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.120]   Next is any day cookware,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.740]   and after interviewing Chef David Chang in episode 122,
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.420]   I was convinced to start cooking more in the microwave,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.740]   and we haven't looked back.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.700]   We've made David Chang's salmon rice in our any day
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.340]   countless times in the microwave,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.660]   and it is so good every time.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.000]   I'm also a big fan of David's book, "Cooking at Home,"
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.700]   which would also make a great gift,
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.300]   and you can get 15% off any day
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.220]   at allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.220]   Or this is one brand where if you're an All The Hacks member
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.680]   you can actually get 20% off
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.180]   with the link in the member site,
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.380]   and if you're interested in joining,
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.820]   you can go to allthehacks.com/join.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.380]   Next is an OXO bench scraper,
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.820]   and I can't remember how a podcast episode
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.380]   about finding a job and negotiating compensation
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.940]   included the recommendation for this product,
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.780]   but now we have a bench scraper in the kitchen,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.980]   and we use it all the time for scooping up vegetables,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.460]   scraping off the counters.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.400]   We even have a non-metal version,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.960]   which is a little bit more delicate,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.020]   that we use for scraping all the food mess our kids leave
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.300]   on the dining room table.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.940]   Next is the Ember mug,
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.980]   which I think we've gifted an Ember mug
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.880]   almost half a dozen times now,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.380]   and we have two in our kitchen.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.580]   They're fantastic at keeping coffee warm all morning,
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.980]   or maybe all day if you're a really slow drinker,
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.080]   and their customer service is fantastic.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.900]   There are some great Black Friday prices
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.820]   that I'll also link to right now,
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.980]   and for putting it in that cup,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.140]   you should really check out Trade Coffee.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.480]   Based on the smile that shows up on Amy's face
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.980]   every time she opens up a package from Trade,
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.700]   I feel confident saying that this would make an amazing gift
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.140]   for any coffee lover.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.020]   We've gifted it multiple times,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.180]   and with every delivery,
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.980]   the recipient's going to get a new curated bag of beans
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.860]   from the top independent roasters around the country.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.220]   Best of all, you can get your first bag free
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.640]   and up to 30% off at allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.860]   Next is the Zolto Denart Universal Wine Glass.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.060]   Now, these glasses are not cheap,
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.140]   but we were gifted a set of them a few years ago,
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.260]   and we absolutely love them.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.780]   I know when you first see the price,
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.700]   it seems absolutely crazy,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.140]   but I'll link to an article
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.140]   from a skeptical Bon Appetit writer
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.380]   who also agreed, just as we do,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.940]   that wine really does taste better out of them.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.120]   But if you're looking for a gift
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.180]   that's more about cocktails than wine,
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.660]   I definitely want to recommend the Death & Co Cocktail Books.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.540]   If you live in New York,
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.580]   you've probably been to Death & Co for a cocktail,
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.140]   but their books look so great on the coffee table,
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.340]   but they are also fantastic recipe guides for making drinks.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.440]   My favorite is Cocktail Codex,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.420]   which focuses on six root cocktails you can master
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.220]   that really give you the knowledge to make almost any drink.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.200]   And finally in this category is the Paprika app.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.260]   I know I've mentioned this app multiple times
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.560]   because I think it's the best way
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.100]   to organize recipes and meal planning.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.420]   However, because it's a bit pricey,
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.300]   I think it could make a great gift,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.620]   but if you really want to level up that gift,
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.500]   you could actually use it to curate
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.060]   all your favorite recipes
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.180]   and share that export with whoever you gift it to
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.860]   and start them off with an amazing recipe catalog.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.620]   And until the end of November,
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.420]   all of their apps are on sale for 40% off.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.460]   Moving on to the tech and gear category,
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.660]   I'm gonna start with standing desks.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.420]   With so many of us working from home,
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.860]   it's such a nice luxury to have a standing desk
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.860]   in my home office,
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.660]   and we actually just got one for Amy as well.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.960]   They used to be very, very expensive,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.040]   but I'm a big fan of Uplift Desk,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.980]   which has some reasonably priced options
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.420]   and a Black Friday sale right now.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.460]   That said, for Amy,
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.420]   we actually just picked up a Trisanti standing desk
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.540]   for even less at Costco,
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.580]   and it is fantastic as well.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.660]   Next, I wanna talk about the Sense Energy Monitor.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.980]   After episode 135 on Home Energy,
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.500]   I was so excited to dive into the data from our Sense
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.940]   even more to try to make our home much more efficient.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.060]   It's a small device
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.300]   that you can attach at your circuit breaker
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.580]   and monitors everything going on in your house
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.420]   and uses a lot of smart detection to identify devices
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.380]   so that you can see how much each device is using.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.220]   It's not quite as cool as the SPAN electrical panel,
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.780]   which has been on my list for years,
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.420]   but given that the Sense is about 1% of the price,
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.980]   I am pretty happy with it right now.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.860]   And you can get 20% off for Black Friday,
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.220]   which I'll link to in the show notes.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.340]   Keeping in the theme of smart home,
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.580]   I've played around with a lot of devices over the years,
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.740]   but none have worked more consistently
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.500]   or stood the test of time
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.140]   than our Lutron Caseta light dimmers.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.700]   With the Lutron Hub, you can connect them to Apple Home
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.900]   or any other smart home platform, and they just work.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.180]   They're so reliable.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.580]   I haven't seen them go on sale,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.540]   but I still highly recommend them.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.060]   Last is a new addition to our house from just a few days ago,
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.380]   which is the Samsung Frame TV.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.340]   Now, I'm not usually one for really nice fancy TVs,
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.940]   and the last three or four we bought
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.460]   have all been very inexpensive TCL TVs
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.220]   from Target or Walmart,
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.460]   but last week we bought a Samsung Frame TV, and we love it.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.980]   Between the matte display
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.100]   and when you get a bezel that isn't black,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.220]   it really does look like art instead of a TV,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.780]   which is a really great change for our living room.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.260]   The Black Friday deals on Samsung's website
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.700]   and all over the internet right now are great,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.260]   but they are even better when you stack them
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.000]   with an employee discount,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.740]   which you can get if you find someone
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.600]   who has access to many different perk sites,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.980]   like Perks at Work or Perkspot,
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.700]   and even better, you can stack that discount
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.720]   with cashback from Rakuten,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.620]   which I'll talk about more at the end of this episode.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.800]   Oh, and also at samsung.com, there is a Chase offer,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.840]   depending on your card, for 15 to 20% off.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.760]   I think it's only up to about $50, but that stacks as well.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.340]   So when we got our TV, we got the employee price
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.480]   plus the credit card points, plus the Rakuten cashback,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.740]   plus the Chase offer, brought the whole price for the TV
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.860]   down 40% from regular pricing, which was amazing.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.700]   If you aren't able to get an employee discount,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.300]   there is also a great price going on right now at Costco
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.780]   with a few extra perks.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.560]   Next, I wanna talk about headphones,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.300]   and I'm sure you're all expecting me
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.180]   to be talking about AirPods, but actually, no.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.140]   I wanna talk about Shox,
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.500]   which makes my new favorite wireless headphones
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.620]   for running and any other time
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.940]   when I actually wanna be a little bit more aware,
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.620]   because they're actually open ear,
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.580]   so you can hear what's going on around you,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.120]   or in my case, you can actually just have a conversation
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.660]   with the person you're going on a run with.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.180]   Amy and I have been using the Shox Open Run Pros
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.380]   and Open Fits for almost six months
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.940]   and absolutely love them.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.060]   Don't get me wrong, I am still a huge fan
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.260]   of the native integration you get when using your AirPods,
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.460]   but any time I'm doing something active, I prefer Shox,
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.020]   but both Shox and AirPods all have really great
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.620]   Black Friday sales right now that I'll link to.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.220]   And on the Apple note, now that we have kids
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.940]   and we're checking bags all the time,
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.900]   I always make sure to keep AirTags
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.500]   in all of our checked bags.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.720]   I haven't needed them,
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.220]   but being able to see where your bags are,
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.900]   see that they made it on your plane,
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.100]   see them at your destination just gives me a lot of comfort,
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.620]   and right now they're on sale for Black Friday as well.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.000]   Next category is clothes and bags.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.900]   I'm gonna start with my absolute favorite clothing brand.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.020]   It's what I wear all the time, and that's Viore.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.740]   They are ridiculously comfy.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.460]   Amy and I wear them pretty much every single day.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.500]   I love the Sunday Performance Joggers, the Tech Tees,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.300]   but the partner I work with at Viore said
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.140]   I absolutely have to check out the Range Shirt Jacket,
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.340]   which I think could make a great gift this year,
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.500]   but honestly, you couldn't go wrong
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.020]   with anything they make, and you can get 20% off
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.380]   at allthehacks.com/vuori.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.060]   Next is the Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket,
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.800]   which has been the go-to jacket for our family.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.240]   It's incredibly warm, very thin,
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.020]   and packs down to almost nothing,
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.540]   so you can take it everywhere.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.580]   They're also very easy to wash, which helps with kids,
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.060]   and I haven't found a great deal for Black Friday yet,
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.580]   but depending on the color you want,
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.820]   you can often find really, really great deals.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.540]   Next is Stance socks.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.100]   We've tried a lot of sock brands,
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.260]   and some of them seem to always fall apart,
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.460]   but day-to-day use, wear-and-tear-wise,
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.980]   we're huge fans of Stance.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.020]   They're durable, super comfortable,
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.620]   and come in so many great colors and patterns.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.320]   They're great stocking stuffers,
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.500]   and they have a cyber sale right now for up to 40% off.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.660]   Finally, two recommendations from Amy specifically.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.700]   One is the Arizona Waterproof Birkenstocks.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.120]   She has a couple pairs of these,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.580]   and the wearability is super versatile.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.800]   She wears them to the park, the beach, brunch,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.380]   pool, gardening, running errands, pretty much everywhere.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.380]   They're waterproof, easy to clean,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.200]   really comfortable, and super budget-friendly.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.880]   She's a big fan, and I'm pretty sure
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.120]   we even have a pair for the kids as well.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.580]   And last is Dagny Dover bags.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.100]   I think Amy has given Dagny Dover bags
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.500]   as a gift more than anything else.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.220]   Her favorites are the Landon Carryall
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.420]   and the Dakota Backpack, though I've seen her
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.600]   give a couple Dagny Dover fanny packs recently.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.440]   I don't see them on sale right now,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.120]   but Amy does have a referral link
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.600]   that she would love it if you wanna use to get $20 off.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.080]   That's allthehacks.com/dagnydover.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.220]   Moving into health and fitness,
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.600]   I know I've mentioned my Oura Ring a lot,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.060]   but it's the one thing that I'm always wearing
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.260]   every single day to track sleep, workouts, heart rate, HRV.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.100]   The Gen 3 even tracks your blood oxygen levels.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.620]   I've been trying to partner with Oura for a while.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.760]   It hasn't happened yet, but I did get them
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.100]   to send me a link for up to $100 off this holiday season,
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.700]   which is at allthehacks.com/oura.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.260]   Next is a book called "Outlive,
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.380]   "The Science and Art of Longevity" from Peter Attia.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.620]   I'm a huge fan of Peter's podcast,
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.340]   and I've had this book pre-ordered
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.980]   since the moment it was announced.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.920]   It is a very long book.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.440]   You can definitely flip around
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.260]   and find the parts you wanna read,
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.320]   but I'm guessing that since we can all agree
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.120]   time is one of our most valuable resources,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.260]   a book about getting more of that back
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.040]   seems well worth the read.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.780]   I totally loved this one.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.840]   Next is a Henson razor.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.280]   We actually started working with most of our sponsors
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.560]   after I used and loved their products
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.020]   and then reached out to them,
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.560]   but Henson was a little bit different.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.520]   They reached out to me and asked if they could be a sponsor.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.760]   I was a little skeptical.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.240]   I already had a shaving routine in place,
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.760]   but after spending a few weeks
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.680]   shaving with a Henson razor on one side
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.400]   and a regular cartridge on the other,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.080]   I was totally convinced,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.160]   not to mention it's a gorgeous razor
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.760]   with blades that only cost $3 to $5 a year,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.300]   so you're actually gonna save money.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.040]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/henson
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.720]   and use the code ALLTHEHACKS,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.000]   you'll get two years of blades free with your order.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.260]   Next is levels.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.960]   Now, I learned so much about my metabolic health
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.260]   wearing a continuous glucose monitor from levels
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.360]   and tracking how my blood sugar reacted to different foods
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.400]   that I ended up getting Amy one too,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.960]   and she thought it was so fascinating.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.760]   We made a bunch of changes and thankfully for me,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.040]   it seems like cinnamon really limits my blood sugar spikes,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.160]   so I am partaking in my fair share of cinnamon rolls
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.080]   during the holidays and feeling much better about it.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.040]   You can get $100 off for Black Friday right now,
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.280]   which I'll link to as well.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.100]   Next is Hydro Flask.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.340]   So we have an entire shelf dedicated
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.640]   to our growing supply of these water bottles
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.940]   and use them daily.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.640]   In fact, we finally just decided
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.180]   to purge all non-Hydro Flask water bottles in the house
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.280]   because these have just become our favorites.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.040]   They have great kids and adult sizes
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.480]   with tons of color options,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.360]   and they're always running sales,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.640]   but I don't see anything for Black Friday yet.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.060]   Next, in the family and kids section,
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.280]   I wanna start with family stuff.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.020]   First is story worth.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.240]   If you've ever wanted to capture all the stories
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.620]   and memories from your loved ones,
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.400]   this makes a great gift.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.800]   Every week for a year,
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.680]   story worth will email your loved one
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.720]   a single life-related question,
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.960]   or the furthest you've traveled,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.200]   and they get compiled at the end of the year
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.480]   into a hardcover book that you can pass down for generations
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.200]   and you can get $10 off at allthehacks.com/storyworth.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.020]   The Aura Photo Frame is a digital photo frame
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.440]   we've had in our house for a while,
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.060]   but recently, we've given it as a gift to my parents,
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.820]   and I think everyone on Amy's side of the family
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.180]   has one too, and it's so seamless
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.900]   to share photos with everyone
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.380]   that we're constantly passing photos around the family.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.420]   They also have a Black Friday sale going on, which is great.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.240]   Next is one of my favorite things
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.980]   to do with family over the holidays,
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.740]   and that is an escape room.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.460]   I don't have a specific recommendation
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.100]   because it varies all around the country or even the world,
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.260]   but Amy and I have probably done 50 of these,
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.040]   and any time we have family around or we're visiting,
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.120]   we try to find one to do with the family and friends.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.300]   I highly recommend it
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.260]   if it's not something you do regularly,
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.580]   and if you're looking to find one locally,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.020]   thanks to Drew and Carrie,
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.900]   who sent in a recommendation to use the Morty app,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.780]   which has a directory of almost every escape room.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.620]   But speaking of escape rooms,
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.760]   a friend of mine worked with Neil Patrick Harris
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.900]   to develop this amazing game called Box One
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.380]   that you can use at home.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.420]   It's a solo one-player, I guess, board game,
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.180]   and I don't really know how to explain it,
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.340]   but anyone you know who likes puzzles
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.240]   or escape rooms will love this.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.740]   I personally thought it was amazing.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.980]   The company my friend runs that produced the game
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.420]   is called Theory 11,
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.220]   and they also sell the most beautiful playing cards
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.140]   in the world.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.540]   You just have to go to their site
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.500]   and see them to understand what I mean,
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.000]   but they have so many collections,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.580]   from Star Wars to Harry Potter, James Bond,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.160]   Notorious B.I.G., and a lot more.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.300]   They make the best stocking stuffers,
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.380]   and Theory 11 also sells an endless supply
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.660]   of amazing and high-quality magic tricks
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.540]   if anyone in your family is interested in magic.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.820]   But if you want Box One
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.620]   or the Star Wars playing card box set,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.700]   you can use the code ALLTHEHAX23 to get 20% off.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.460]   Next is something we've now given
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.920]   to all four of our parents,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.780]   which is a subscription to Delete.me.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.740]   As you probably know from listening to this show,
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.340]   it's crazy how many sites sell
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.740]   and share your personal data,
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.280]   and it's a huge pain to get them all to take it down.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.200]   Delete.me does all of this for you,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.800]   and it's not the sexiest, coolest gift to give someone,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.320]   but it's so cool to be able to Google all of our parents
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.840]   and not find their information online anymore.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.480]   You can get 20% off at allthehax.com/delete.me.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.640]   In the kids section,
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.480]   I'm gonna start with something
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.280]   that our girls wake up every morning
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.800]   and immediately start using,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.780]   and that's a Tony Box.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.480]   Just think of a small speaker
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.880]   that has a bunch of characters you can put on top,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.520]   and they start playing stories,
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.320]   but you can also create your own custom stories
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.040]   and upload them to your own custom Tonys.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.800]   It keeps them entertained for hours,
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.600]   and the best part is it doesn't involve a screen,
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.240]   and Black Friday sale is up to 30% off.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.640]   Then we have Jelly Cat stuffed animals.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.420]   Our girls' favorite little friends
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.040]   are their Jelly Cat plushies.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.520]   They're high quality, super soft and huggable.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.600]   I love the assortment of animals and foods
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.080]   and everything Jelly Cat makes.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.180]   I'll link to them in the show notes.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.440]   Also, our kids love their little sleepies jammies.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.880]   These PJs are hands down our girls' favorites.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.400]   They're made from bamboo viscose,
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.960]   so they're buttery soft, breathable, and stretchy,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.840]   and last much longer than some standard PJs.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.580]   They also have a ton of fun prints and colors.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.520]   They're doing a 30% off sale right now
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.500]   if you use the promo code LSFAM.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.000]   Next is Lovevery.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.540]   We've had a subscription to Lovevery
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.600]   since our first daughter was born.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.900]   They make these beautiful,
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.400]   award-winning Montessori-inspired toys,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.320]   and they send them in a box to your home
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.200]   every two to three months.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.180]   All the toys are designed by child development experts.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.440]   They're well-built and sustainably made.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.800]   I haven't seen a sale yet.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.600]   I don't think I've ever gotten a sale,
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.840]   but if you want $20 off your subscription,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.740]   you can use my referral link, allthehacks.com/lovevery.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.000]   Next is one of the coolest stories of a gift on this list,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.540]   and that is backpacks from 50/50 Gear,
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.360]   which are fantastic for going out with the kids,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.840]   and the reason this is so cool
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.420]   is because one of the founders, Adam,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.880]   is an All The Hacks listener
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.400]   who actually heard me talk about
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.940]   checking your state's unclaimed money website
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.520]   to see if you're owed anything,
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.440]   and ended up finding $5,000.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.240]   He used that money to help get this company off the ground,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.760]   and to say thank you, he created a promo code,
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.580]   All The Hacks, for anyone listening
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.280]   to get 10% off their order.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.600]   We have one of these bags,
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.800]   and it's become our go-to bag for going out with the kids.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.320]   Next is a repeat from last year,
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.280]   but I guess that's fair
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.760]   because I've actually had to buy this stroller twice
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   because we left it on the sidewalk and drove off without it,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.200]   and that's the Babies & Yo-Yo.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.080]   It's such a good travel stroller,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.920]   and this is coming from someone, me,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.600]   who built a spreadsheet to compare over 50 strollers.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.240]   If you like the toffee color,
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.120]   you can get 20% off right now for Black Friday.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.600]   Otherwise, I haven't seen another deal yet.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.500]   And finally for kids is the Nanette Baby Monitor.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.760]   You probably need to know someone incredibly well,
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.240]   or maybe even be married to them
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.500]   to get them a baby monitor as a gift,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.400]   but the Nanette is such a great product
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.840]   that I feel like I need to include it on this list.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.440]   It even has a split-screen mode
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.400]   if you wanna watch two kids at once,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.920]   and it's an FSA-eligible expense,
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.760]   and so if you have FSA dollars to spend before year-end,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.400]   it's a great option.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.280]   Even better, you can get 30% off
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.480]   for their Black Friday sale right now.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.960]   And the last section is on learning.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.440]   First off, obviously, if anyone in your family
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.160]   or any of your friends or colleagues love to learn,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.120]   my number one tip is to send them
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.040]   the "All The Hacks" podcast or newsletter, of course,
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.240]   but if you're looking for gifts that aren't this podcast,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.640]   I'm gonna start first with the book "Die With Zero."
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.100]   And I think anyone listening to this show
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.200]   has heard me mention it many times,
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.560]   and the reason I keep bringing it up
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.440]   is because it had such a huge impact
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.680]   on the way I think about life and money
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.560]   that I felt it had to be on this list,
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.360]   and it's a book that I've gifted multiple times.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.160]   Next is "Masterclass."
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.840]   I know I could spend hours watching
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.520]   all the classes they have,
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.760]   and I'm confident "Masterclass" makes a good gift
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.720]   because I actually gave one to my dad last year.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.120]   There's something for everyone,
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.680]   and you can get two memberships
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.200]   for the price of one right now
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.920]   at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.160]   Next is "The Bucket List Journal."
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.080]   I had Ben Nimton join me on episode 36
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.440]   who wrote this book to talk about bucket lists,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.720]   audacious goals, and living the life you truly want.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.440]   And to help people actually achieve those goals,
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.920]   Ben wrote this book,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.280]   but it's really more of a journal
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.560]   with some inspiration,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.120]   but a lot of room for you to track your lists,
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.760]   write down some tangible steps
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.080]   you can take towards your goals
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.000]   so you will ultimately achieve them.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.080]   Next, I actually have three books
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.320]   that I haven't read yet,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.200]   but that really bubbled up to the top
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.560]   of recommendation lists from this year.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.280]   One is "When Breath Becomes Air."
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.160]   Sahil Bloom has now been on the podcast three times,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.280]   though that third episode has not come out yet.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.920]   And during our conversations,
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.720]   he said that this was his most gifted book.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.080]   And while I haven't read it,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.160]   I trust Sahil's advice so much
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.520]   that I'm putting it on the guide,
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.920]   and hopefully I will share a review as soon as I read it.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.760]   Next is "Same as Ever,
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.880]   A Guide to What Never Changes" by Morgan Housel.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.840]   I am a huge fan of Morgan's writing.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.400]   I loved his last book, "Psychology of Money,"
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.720]   and I've had a chance to interview him on that book,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.120]   and it was such a good interview,
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.720]   and it's probably why I'm so excited
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.440]   to read his latest book that came out this month.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.120]   I should be having him on the podcast early next year
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.200]   to talk about it.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.960]   So if reading his new book brings out
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.920]   any questions you want to ask Morgan,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.280]   please share them with me and I will ask him.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.680]   And last is a book called "4,000 Weeks."
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.280]   I recently actually hosted a member discussion
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.880]   for all the Hacks members on the book "Die With Zero"
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.840]   and that concept of maximizing your net fulfillment
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.200]   instead of your net worth.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.240]   And one of the top recommendations
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.520]   was to check out the book "4,000 Weeks."
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.560]   So it's on my list as well.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.920]   I haven't read any of those last three books,
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.720]   so I can't fully endorse them,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.640]   but if they look good to you or you're excited about them,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.200]   they might make some really great gifts.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.720]   So those are all my recommendations for gifts.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.820]   I do want to talk about how to save money
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.640]   on anything you're shopping for this holiday season,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.880]   but first I'll just remind you again
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.400]   that all the links for everything I just mentioned
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.640]   are in the show notes.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   They're at allthehacks.com/gifts,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.600]   and using the links in all of those places
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.560]   is a huge way to support us in the show this holiday season.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.600]   So thanks in advance for doing that.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.560]   So when it comes to shopping online,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.960]   there's three big ways I like to save.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.240]   One is using cashback portals.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.660]   I always start at Cashback Monitor
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.600]   to see the best way to earn cashback
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.420]   or points shopping online.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.360]   For example, there are sometimes places where Rakuten,
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.440]   which is often my default site,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.600]   doesn't earn as many points as using something
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.880]   like the American Airline Shopping Portal
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.400]   or another platform.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.720]   There are some platforms
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.760]   that get listed on Cashback Monitor
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.600]   that seem to have higher rates than you would think,
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.560]   and once you click into them, you realize,
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.480]   oh, well, I've got to go buy a gift card
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.780]   and I can only buy up to $100, so it's a little complicated.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.880]   But in general, Rakuten, Top Cashback,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.120]   all the credit card and airline portals
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.800]   are all pretty straightforward.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.760]   But at the end of the day,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.720]   there's one reason why I love Rakuten
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.760]   more than any other shopping portal,
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.240]   if it has the best rate,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.320]   and that's because you can take all the cash back
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.440]   and convert it directly to American Express points.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.320]   So instead of earning 10% back,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.440]   you can earn 10 American Express points per dollar.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.680]   And given that I'm usually able to get anywhere
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.500]   from one and a half all the way up to five cents per point
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.120]   with my Amex points, that takes a 10% cashback
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.000]   to anywhere from 15 to 50% cashback.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.800]   So definitely a big fan of cashback with Rakuten.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.680]   We just used it on that Samsung TV I talked about.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.700]   And if you haven't signed up for Rakuten,
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.720]   you can actually get $40 free
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.960]   after your first purchase right now
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.480]   using my referral link at allthehacks.com/rakuten.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.080]   Next is finding promo codes and discounts.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.320]   I feel like it's been pretty difficult nowadays
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.780]   to find working promo codes online.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.920]   A lot of the sites that used to share them
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.360]   now are really sharing these referral links
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.280]   and affiliate links in disguise.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.640]   And so one, you have to be extra careful here
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.760]   because if you're using a cashback portal,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.560]   sometimes the links through those portals
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.260]   end up overriding your shopping portal tracking.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.380]   So you'll wanna make sure
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.420]   that you refresh and double check.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.660]   I will check sites like RetailMeNot
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.820]   or tools like Honey to find a promo code.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.220]   It doesn't work as often.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.320]   What I now do a lot more often
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.840]   is just ask the live chat on the website
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.020]   if there's a discount.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.920]   Very often I've found live chat really helpful
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.080]   to be able to get promos or discounts on a shopping card.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.620]   So you can definitely try that.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.480]   Another great way to get discounts
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.280]   is just look at all the offers.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.800]   You see from Amex, Chase, CapOne,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.640]   whatever your card company is.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.240]   When you log on to any of those banking websites,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.320]   you'll be able to add offers to your cards.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   And sometimes there's offers for things
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.120]   that are totally irrelevant to you
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.800]   and you're not gonna be purchasing.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.640]   But sometimes there's really broad ones.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.280]   Like right now, because on Saturday
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.800]   is small business Saturday,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.760]   most Amex cards will have a $5 off $50
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.200]   as long as you use your card
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.240]   to buy something from a small business.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.760]   But there are so, so many offers in the Amex portal
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.360]   that it can be a little bit hard to manage
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.920]   and sometimes hard to browse.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.120]   Keep in mind that there are often more offers
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.200]   than you'll see.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.600]   So for example, right now on my Amex Platinum,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.200]   I have 345 offers added to my Amex Platinum card.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.320]   And one other thing is once you add an offer to one card,
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.780]   you often can't add it to the other card.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.400]   So when there've been some really, really amazing offers
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.200]   on things that you buy regularly
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.360]   and you wish that you had it on multiple cards
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.520]   so you could use the offer over and over again,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.840]   the way to get around that
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.760]   is either to try to open it in two windows
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.320]   and click it at the exact same time,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.720]   which seems very difficult
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.760]   or use a product like Card Pointers.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.080]   Card Pointers is a mobile app
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.840]   to manage all of your credit cards, all of your earning.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.460]   You don't even have to sync to your banks to use it,
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.240]   but they have a browser extension
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.660]   that will auto add all of the offers on Amex and Chase
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.040]   to your account without you having to do anything.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.160]   And best of all, they'll hit the Amex and Chase API
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.760]   for all your cards at the same time.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.960]   So you can actually end up adding those offers
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.720]   to multiple cards at once.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.360]   So definitely go in and look at those offers in advance
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.120]   to make sure you're using the right card
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.160]   to get a deal this holiday season.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.200]   And also on Saturday, definitely make sure
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.480]   that if you're shopping at any local businesses
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.280]   to add that $5 off $50 to get a little extra discount.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.640]   Finally, the third category is gift cards.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   Most retailers online don't qualify
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.060]   for any elevated bonus points
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.440]   like you would get for travel or dining or groceries.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.880]   So one tactic I love when I'm buying something
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   from a retailer is buying gift cards for that retailer,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.960]   somewhere where I earn more than two points per dollar.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.540]   So that could be four points at the grocery store
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.840]   with an Amex Gold or 5% back on Amazon.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   Or if you have a card that earns a lot of points
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.880]   at gas stations or office supply stores,
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.080]   they often sell gift cards as well.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.920]   So those are three tactics for saving money online
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.280]   this holiday season.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.960]   I really hope that's helpful.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.200]   And I hope that some of these gifts were helpful.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.880]   If you have any recommendations either now or later
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.400]   for other gifts you think would make great addition
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.180]   to this guide, let me know.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.160]   Some of the things on this list were added
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.280]   because people sent them to me last year.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.180]   So even though I might not get to share it
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.460]   for another 12 months,
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.680]   I would love to see your recommendations.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.960]   Also, a lot of these are things that I've already gotten
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.720]   and I'm getting hit up from family
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.460]   for things that I might need for Christmas.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.000]   So I would love your recommendations
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.840]   if you think there's something
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.640]   I should put on my list as well.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.080]   Thank you so much for listening to this bonus episode.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.440]   If you know anyone that you think would enjoy it,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.560]   please consider sharing it with them.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.520]   Or if they're not podcast people,
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.660]   feel free to send them to the online version

[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.320]   to take the All The Hacks survey yet,
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.800]   it would mean the world to me.

[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.060]   Finally, I just wanna say how grateful I am
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.760]   for all of your support this year,

[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.940]   I truly appreciate it.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.340]   Okay, that's it.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.940]   I will see you again for another episode tomorrow.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   (crickets chirping)
