[00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.160]   When are you coming to Miami? Are you there already? I'm here. I just got here. Oh,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.000]   cool. Come tomorrow. We'll have a big weekend. I mean, you get a ride on someone else's plane.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.800]   Mine's been repossessed. You can give me a ride. I'll have mine for at least another couple weeks.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   I love my commercial. You know, I left my commercial. Every fan of all in this weekend
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.800]   startup stops me and takes a selfie. I cannot tell you the love in Miami. I sat down to have
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.760]   a meal outside. Were you by yourself or you were by myself? It's 1130. It's like, Hey,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.480]   everything's closed. There was this one little place that's open. I kid you not. I sit down,
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.120]   two guys come over. We love the pod and I'm trying to eat my meal. And they're asking me
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.840]   questions and they want to know where's Friedberg's introduction. And I'm like, it's so
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.400]   bad. Well, I showed them the video and they were in stitches. I was like, guys, there's only like
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.560]   five people have seen this video and now it's you too. So there's seven people. They were so
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.720]   aware of it. They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.800]   were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.200]   going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.200]   be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there. They were like, oh, we're going to be there.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   We should never have cut that. Well, we could play it now. It was good. Thank you. It was
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.040]   incredible. I say we just we just throw to it right now. Is that a good plan? Maybe. And here we go.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.680]   In three, two. This is like the nerd Olympics for Friedberg. He's like nerd stretching. He's having
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.640]   a nerd freak out right now. You know what I'm most excited about that? I don't have to listen to
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.680]   Jason's interest. Oh, my God. You're on like nerd role. That's like nerd Adderall. Take it easy,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.680]   Dungeon Master. This guy hasn't been so happy since he rolled a 30 on the 30 sided die. Jesus.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.560]   Oh, my God. I've got a plus seven. Where does that come from? Where? Oh, from Dungeons. I've
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.720]   never played. Oh, really? You were playing League of Legends. OK. OK, I'm going to just apologize
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.600]   in advance to the audience. I'm going to apologize in advance to the audience. I'm going to apologize
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.240]   in advance to the audience. OK, here we go. No interruptions, please. Thank you.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.040]   In the voice of J. Cal. Hold on. Is there a frog in your throat? What's going on there? Oh, God.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.240]   He's super loud and has nothing to say, but we keep him around because he has a producer we don't
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.920]   have to pay. One good investment in his 30 year career, but he wrote a book about it and tells all
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.520]   the VCs to kiss his rear. He's one of a kind will always come to your rescue when you're in a bind.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.600]   He calls himself Mr. Calacanis, but we all just call him an anus.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.160]   Jason Calacanis, everyone. Jason, welcome to the show.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640]   Great to be here. Great to be here. Thanks for the kind intro.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.160]   Good to have you. His words are incendiary and divisive, but only if you identify as
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.520]   a gender fluid progressive. Otherwise to you, he's a scholarly god fighting the great war
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   against the rise of the woke mob. Hey, pal, it's the 17th most important guy from PayPal.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   He's back with the same political speaking tracks. The one and only Mr. David Sachs.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.400]   David, welcome to the show.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120]   Thank you. Thank you. I think we need to work with some of your rhymes, but.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.440]   Yeah, we might need to tighten that up and workshop it. Yeah.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   Keep going. Maybe it gets better.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.760]   He contradicts himself twice a week, but we're still enraptured because his mink sweaters are
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.920]   so sleek. His monologues last most of the show, but he never talks anymore about IPO 2.0.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.360]   As he'll tell you over and over, he drinks the world's greatest wine,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.960]   but commenting on other topics is a bit below his line. He's Silicon Valley's most renowned dictator,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   our friend, the verbal masturbator, Chamath Pali hot potato. Chamath, welcome to the show.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.080]   Great to have you here.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.280]   Wow. That was brutal.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.840]   God.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.440]   Oh, I'm not done. We're an increasingly notorious whack pack litigated by David Sachs,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.080]   emceed by an investor hack and soon to be canceled because of the performance of Chamath's latest
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.480]   back. We are the all in pod and you'll never get this 90 minutes back. I'm the Sultan of science
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   with an IQ of 103. I'm taking the throne as this podcast's new MVP.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   New MC. Thank you everyone.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.720]   I'm going to have to, man. I don't want to read the YouTube comments on this one.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.680]   All right. We'll scrap it.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.520]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.800]   you can't spike this.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.040]   Sachs commentary.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.720]   Well, I mean, uh, it, it felt a little bit scorched earth to me.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.000]   Um, I thought mine was fine, but, uh, I think these other guys are a little bit shell shocked
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.400]   right now.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   I went a little hard. I actually wrote this for your, uh, for your birthday. And then I decided,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.120]   to throw it in.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.080]   Okay. Well,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.600]   I guess maybe we save it for your birthday.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.240]   Yeah. You may want to do something funnier for my birthday.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.680]   I'll be back next week with some actually funny intro material, apologies to the audience.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   All right. All right. Listen, stocks and crypto have
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.040]   plummeted tiger coin based Shopify employee, RSUs meme stocks. It's all gone. Everybody.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.560]   Uh, the world's over.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.880]   Uh, so, uh, where do we start? You guys want to start with crypto stocks?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.840]   Where do we even begin?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.600]   Should we talk about what happened when rates went to zero
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.040]   and how financial assets inflated? And I think we talked about this during the pandemic,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.240]   right? When the pandemic was starting to moth. I remember an early,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.680]   show we did where you and I talked about how it felt like we were going into like the roaring
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.200]   rapids, right? At like magic mountain or Disneyland. I kind of described it like that.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.960]   Like, it feels like you're going to a rushing river
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.120]   and there was just all this capital flowing so fast, like overnight. There were, it was like,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.040]   all of a sudden we went from this like COVID standstill to, oh my God, this rush of capital.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.080]   And you could feel it, right? All the businesses were all involved in,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.680]   started getting term sheets and doing deals. And there was SPACs and transactions.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.440]   It was an incredible rush of capital. And so when, you know, the central bank made interest
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.880]   rates zero and then banks could lend out money at close to zero and still make money.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.000]   And then people could lever up assets and then those asset values inflated and they could borrow
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.600]   more and keep, you know, investing in more and buying more ultimately, you know, we had bubble
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.080]   after bubble. And, uh, we saw a lot of things that, um, may not have necessarily been valued
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   based on a historical setting. But, um, you know, we saw a lot of things that, um, you know, may not
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.320]   have necessarily been valued based on a historical setting. So, um, we saw a lot of things that, um, we
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.680]   multiples or comparables or cashflow, but really it was just about, Hey, if I invest X dollars and
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.480]   someone else is willing to pay Y dollars for this asset tomorrow, I'm gonna make money.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.200]   And, you know, suddenly the frigging vacuum came out, which was like, let's take all that money
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.040]   back. And so when interest rates got hiked, it was like all that money's coming back out of the
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.560]   system. And it was like this wishing sound, like the airlock got opened and all the cash came back
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.000]   out. And as a result, the bubbles just all deflated. And it happened so quickly that it's,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.800]   what was crazy to me was that for so long, everyone's been talking about how everything
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.720]   feels so overvalued. So everyone was just waiting for the moment when the wishing sound began,
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   and then everyone laid off all the risk and it happened so fast and it's still happening.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.120]   People are still trying to unwind the things where they're, you know, in huge positions, but,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.520]   uh, you know, I think it really is just, uh, it really is this, uh, this kind of incredible
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.920]   moment where you see all the money get pumped in and it all gets rushed out just as fast.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.960]   Um, and I think we're all kind of like, you know, in awe at how quickly the response has been.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.600]   So maybe some context is helpful from 2018,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.920]   up until the beginning or not really the beginning of this year, but probably Q4 of last year,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.960]   you could have calculated an incredibly tight correlation between
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.840]   the stock market and the fed money printer. So the fed is
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.080]   in control of how they can introduce dollars into the economy. How do they do that? They literally
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.800]   manifest money. They don't actually technically print it, but let's just assume for these purposes
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.920]   that they actually do print it. And they literally take that money and they enter the market and they
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   buy things with it. And they're giving you this newly created money that they just created out of
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:11.440]   thin air from 19 or from 2018, up until about Q4 of last year, there was a 0.92 correlation between
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.760]   that and the $1.9 billion. So that's a correlation between the $1.9 billion and the $1.9 billion.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.480]   And the S and P 500 going up. What does that mean? So if you look at a negative one correlation,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.720]   that means that if something goes up, this thing goes down dollar for dollar, that would be
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.920]   perfectly negatively correlated. If you look at something that has a zero correlation, that means
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.280]   it's just random, whether whether one thing goes up and down has no influence on the other. But a
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.200]   point 92% correlation effectively means that for every dollar the Fed created, the stock market was
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.680]   going up. And that's what we're looking at. And that's what we're looking at. And that's what we're
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:41.920]   looking at. And that's what we're looking at. And that's what we're looking at. And that's what we're
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.520]   looking at. And that's what we're looking at. And that's what we're looking at. And that is literally
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   what we had up until November of 2021. Since the beginning of this year, till about yesterday,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.080]   so I think the number is still going up, probably by at least by a trillion dollars,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:03.920]   we have destroyed collectively as a society. 35 trillion dollars in global market value.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:11.600]   Now, to give you a sense of that, that's 14% of all global wealth,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.320]   that has been destroyed in basically five months. And for reference, in 2008, when we went through,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.840]   you know, a cataclysmic shock to the system that threatened the banking infrastructure of America,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.360]   and a potential contagion to the world, that destroyed 19% of the world's global
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.400]   wealth at that point. So, you know, we're approaching some really crazy heady moments
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.520]   in time, where in terms of the market correction and the value destruction, the difference
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.680]   here is that the last time around, it was really about a handful of financial institutions,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.200]   and some very specific assets, right? Mortgage backed securities, you know, some parts of the,
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.000]   of the credit market, and then a bunch of financial stocks. And that was largely it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.360]   This time around, as you just said, Freebrooke, it's literally everything that's getting smoked,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.440]   there is not a place that you can effectively hide, that has been safe, crypto smoked, the
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.160]   credit markets, totally frozen, the equity markets, Nasdaq is in a bear market, the S&P is basically
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.320]   flirting with a bear market now. And I don't really see any end in sight. Meanwhile, we're
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   waiting for CPI to downtick inflation hasn't really done that. It looks like consumer price index,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.800]   how much stuff cost. So that's taking a lot longer than we thought to sort of roll over. Separately,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.360]   jobless claims are now starting to tick up, which means that companies are beginning to affect layoffs,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.440]   because they feel this pressure. So now you're going to see an unemployment rate that starts to
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.680]   go up. And then meanwhile, we're fighting a proxy war in the Ukraine against Russia to the tune of
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.040]   about, you know, $40 billion every sort of month or so when we open the paper and decide to read
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.400]   about it. So you put all these things together, it's not clear that there is the momentum to
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.440]   create a market bottom,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.480]   real estate, Chamath, if you look at it, was a major
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.280]   compression in 2008. Real estate held up is holding up seems to be holding a little
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.880]   bit I don't know how long that's gonna last with mortgages going up. So when you were talking about
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   all the different categories, I was like, that's the one category that I guess hasn't fallen yet.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.120]   Sax, what's your take on this? Yeah, I mean, look, we're in a stock market crash that
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.200]   I think over the last week sort of became a panic. I mean, I think now there's panic selling going on.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.960]   That's not to say that it's all oversold. But certainly there are names now that are
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.040]   starting to become screaming buys. But nobody has the capital to buy. I mean, it's easy to say,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.200]   you know, in theory that you should be greedy when others are fearful and fearful
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.360]   when others are greedy. The problem is that everyone's already fully deployed. And then
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   when the stock market crashes, they got no cash left to buy up new names. And, you know, that's
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.920]   one of the things that you've noticed in this downturn, and I'd say especially with crypto,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.960]   is with all the other crypto downturns, there were always, you know, the crypto accounts saying
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.080]   hodl or buy the dip or, you know, they had the laser eyes going. I don't see any of that right
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:11.120]   now. No, you know, your capitulation fear. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So this is just a route across the board.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.640]   I agree. It's every asset class. I think home prices that's coming, Jason, because, like you
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.960]   said, mortgages are going up. Inventory is going up. So that's a leading indicator. People can't
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.200]   afford the same mortgage they did before because rates are going up very fast. So, you know,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.800]   sellers are gonna have to drop prices. And until they're willing to do that, the inventories go up.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's a little dance that happens in real estate is the sellers don't want to accept
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.040]   reality and they don't have to sell because they're living in it, as opposed to the
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   their crypto holdings, which they're not living in and they're not getting value from.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.840]   And frankly, I think the consumer in general, that's the next shoe to drop here,
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.280]   because right now it's been you had this sort of financial correction. You had this massive
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.040]   asset inflation and now that the sort of the air has come out of the balloon. But the consumer
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.120]   has generally been holding up pretty well. Obviously, we had unemployment near 3%, very low,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.960]   although the labor participation wasn't great, but the consumer was doing fine. It was sort of
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.200]   holding up the economy. Now, I think you've got a bunch of different factors that are going to
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   really hurt the consumer over the next several months. Like you said, interest rates going up
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:26.560]   means that home loans become more expensive, car loans, any other personal consumption loans go up.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:32.320]   Credit card debt now has all of a sudden skyrocketed. So there's an article in Axios on
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:40.880]   this, that the amount of consumer debt is surging. And to this highest level of increase in over
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.840]   a decade. So consumers are turning to plastic to cover the soaring cost of everything. And then
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:54.000]   because of inflation, that wages in real terms fell 2.6% over the past year. So in other words,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.840]   inflation, when you say inflation, so if you're to look at wages in real terms,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.520]   people are actually making less money, you give somebody a 10% raise 8% inflation, it nets out to
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:10.800]   two. Well, no, you're giving them a 6% raise. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. Or like, like a 5.6% raise.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.280]   raise or something like that against 8% inflation. And net net third down 2.6%.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.080]   They're down to not up. Yeah, in purchasing power.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.800]   Exactly. In spending power. sex's point is like, I mean, the number was 60 billion of new consumer
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.120]   credit last month, which is like something we haven't seen in a very long time as consumers
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.960]   try and bridge this gap to afford the things that they've gotten used to spending money on.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.760]   To jump up like that just indicates that we may be in the beginning of a consumer credit bubble now,
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.720]   which is scary, right? This is this is the question is what are the
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.200]   next shoes to drop? So So you think about like, what's happened in the market? So so far, it's
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.480]   mainly been multiple multiple compression, like earnings season was pretty good. I mean,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   it was amazing for some folks. Yeah, for some folks. So the stocks that got hammered were
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.640]   generally the COVID stocks. It was the Peloton, the Netflix, zoom, you know, you could like Coinbase
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.280]   and Robin Hood with the day traders because that was people are laying off that stuff. So but so
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.640]   basically, the COVID stocks have been hammered, but the B2B stocks actually had really good results.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:18.480]   And yet, you know, the SAS index is down, like 80%. You know, the average SAS multiple,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   it was over 15 times, you know, last year, in the on the public comps announced down to 5.6. So the
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.960]   SAS companies have been hammered despite having great earnings. So we don't know now they're B2B,
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.720]   they don't, they're a little bit insulated from the consumer. But what we don't know is what
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:40.560]   happens over the next six months? If we go into a deep recession, then do even the B2B companies start
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.720]   being impacted? That would look like sacks just to be clear, you know, people maybe start canceling
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   their Netflix, or they don't take that vacation. That's the consumer getting hit first, a business
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   that's laying off 10 or 25% of their employees, which are starting to see that contagion.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.280]   They might also pull out their SAS bill and say, here's 12 SAS products we're playing for.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.000]   Let's consolidate down to eight, right, I've got a SAS startup that sells, you know, six and seven
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.480]   figure deals into enterprises. And they close their deal with Uber the day before Doris memo came
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.760]   out saying we got to be really focused on cost cutting what Wall Street wants now is free cash
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.360]   flow. Yep, we got to really sharpen our pencils. They were like, shoot, good thing we got this
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.440]   across the finish line. If it had been like two days later, it just would have been a much tougher
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   process. So first, you're right, the companies that get impacted are the ones with exposure to
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.360]   the consumer. But then those companies start sharpening their pencils and buying less.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.840]   So the question is, how much are earnings now going to be impacted in the B2B space? And what
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.400]   sort of recession do we have? I think like recession now is this inevitable? You can tomorrow
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.720]   last point, you can't have 14% of global wealth wiped out practically overnight, and not have that
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.480]   translate into a big recession, monetary velocity is going to slow dramatically, the money circulating
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.760]   around is you can feel the brakes happen, you can feel the the the table, people are just way poorer
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.400]   than they were six months ago. Now, guys, just to be clear, we actually haven't started to remove the
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.880]   money in the system. So the process of quantitative tightening, which is the feds mechanism of removing
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.520]   liquidity,
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:16.640]   is going to start now, to the tune of about $90 billion a month. But to run off all the money that
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.840]   they printed will still take three years, right. So we have to take about $3 trillion of excess
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:28.000]   capital out of the economy. And so if you add that 3 trillion as well, that's just going to disappear
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.720]   to the 14 trillion, we've already you know, or the 14%, the 35 trillion, sorry, you know, you're
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.680]   starting to touch numbers that are, you know, as bad as the GFC in terms of global wealth destruction.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.240]   And again,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   you're referring to the great financial crisis, when you say GFC 2008,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   like the GFC, this wealth destruction is touching a lot of normal everyday folks
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.400]   in very broad based ways. And that wasn't necessarily the case, there were a lot of
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.680]   people that unfortunately lost their home. But even that was still relatively contained to the
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.200]   hundreds of 1000s. Here, we're talking about 10s of millions of people owning every kind of
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.160]   imaginable asset class, who's seen wealth destruction, you know, somewhere between 25%
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.720]   to 90%. And that's very hard to freeberg. Yeah, but I just want to make the case like people keep
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.240]   using this term wealth destruction. And it was only wealth that was accumulated in the last few
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.600]   quarters, since we had COVID. And we released all this capital and made interest rates zero
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.360]   and flooded the market with money. So everyone kind of gets the money. And then they're like,
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.840]   hey, I'm worth a lot more. And then all of a sudden, the free money is taken back. And you're
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.080]   like, Oh, my gosh, I'm worth less. I've been destroyed. It's you know, it's crazy. The real
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.840]   reality is, this was meant to stimulate the economy, money was released. And the idea when
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.360]   you release capital from a central bank is that that capital flows its way into productive assets,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.400]   meaning businesses that can employ people that can create products that people want to consume.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.720]   And ultimately, it's very hard to manage that when your only mechanism
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.000]   is to raise or lower interest rates and make capital available or buy bonds.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   At the end of the day, a lot of that capital flowed into financial assets and inflation
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.760]   and inflationary moments in terms of asset prices. And we didn't actually have that.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.960]   And so we created a new system that inflated the value of those assets, the value of stocks,
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.120]   the value of crypto, the value of bonds that we own the value of startups that we all own.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.240]   And all of those assets, the value of the stock went up, but the capital didn't necessarily flow
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.000]   into creating new jobs, creating new businesses and creating new products. I want to finish this
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.640]   one, because I think it's really important. And at the end of the day, if that capital didn't
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.920]   really go into create value, and it comes back out. And all that happened was we had
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.320]   a lot of people who were in a recession, and we didn't actually create new jobs and didn't actually
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.040]   stimulate the real productive economy. That's where we have a problem with stagflation and
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.360]   where we are inevitably going to run into a recession. And I think the biggest concern I have,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.480]   let's be honest, we're in a recession right now. This is the second quarter.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:56.960]   We're in a recession.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.840]   The biggest concern I have, as I mentioned earlier, is this consumer credit problem.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.560]   A lot of consumers got used to the free money over the past two years. And people took that money and
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.840]   they went and bought new cars or they bought crypto or they bought an NFT or another NFTs.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.480]   Got used to living a lifestyle that allowed them to spend in a way that they otherwise would not
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.840]   have been able to spend. And then all of a sudden, the rug got pulled out. And now everyone's like,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.160]   well, I want to keep living this lifestyle. I want to keep spending this money. I want to I had all
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.360]   this stuff taken away from me. Shoot, what am I going to do? And then they take on credit. And the
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.840]   credit markets haven't tightened enough yet on the consumer side that we may find ourselves in a
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.200]   really ugly consumer credit bubble. Here's a crazy statistic for you guys. In the 2008 financial crisis,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:47.360]   the median home price to median income in the United States was 5x. Today, it's 7x. So people
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:54.000]   today own homes that are significantly more expensive relative to their income and earnings
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.360]   than was the case during the financial crisis that caused a massive housing bubble.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.640]   You're missing a bunch of important data points here. The most important thing that happened
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.520]   was we changed the way that we are allowed to capitalize mortgages and the borrow rates.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.680]   So that fundamentally is what drove that. Okay, so for example, you were not
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.240]   allowed for example, to have a qualifying mortgage be over a million dollars. At the end of last year,
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.680]   we changed those rules. So if you X out those effects that allow the FDIC and all of these,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.120]   you know, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and all of this financial gobbledygook acronym infrastructure
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.000]   that props up the US economy. If you factor in those rules, I don't think it's as extreme as
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.240]   you're describing. What do you mean consumers have more debt per relative to the value of their home?
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.600]   Sorry, debt relative to their income that they did during the 2008 financial crisis. That's a fact.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.560]   That's not me to do with the structural way the market works. But like,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.120]   what I'm saying is the market allows you to be that levered without actually getting foreclosed
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   on or, you know, you're allowed to get the borrow rates that allow you to do that. All I'm saying is,
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   it's not like excess credit is being built up in the system abnormally by consumers. It's
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.520]   just that these products again, are being structured in a way that gets people down.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.600]   And real estate is a very unique category because you have i buyers taking
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.520]   stuff off the market, you have regulation not letting people build more. So I would be very
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.400]   reticent to extrapolate what's happening in real estate.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.920]   I don't think we have like a an issue in real estate, to be completely honest with you,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:24.400]   I think that we may have a looming credit crisis. But the practical issue today is I
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.320]   think asset wealth destruction in the financial markets, whenever that happens,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   generally tends to lead to what SAC said, which is belt tightening by companies
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:39.440]   focus on maximizing short term free cash flow, which unfortunately, the way to cut that is
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.440]   by cutting OPEX. And the way that you cut OPEX is by unfortunately, spending less on goods and
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.800]   services, which affects other companies, and firing employees. And I think what you're going to start
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.480]   to see are a bunch of those things where these companies make these short term optimizations,
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.920]   then how that unfortunately impacts the consumer is what Friedberg said, which is that if the
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.840]   consumer was already living, you know, sort of at the knife's edge and using a lot of credit to
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.360]   basically allow them to live in a short term way, then they're going to be able to get a lot of
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.520]   money back. And so that's the kind of thing that's going to be happening. And so I think
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.480]   that's the kind of thing that's going to be happening. And I think that's the kind of thing
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.200]   that's going to be happening. And I think that's the kind of thing that's going to be happening.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.680]   Whether that meant not having a job, or whether that meant, you know, vacationing and staying in
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.120]   Airbnbs, all of that will come to an end. Now, you can say what is the canary in the coal mine.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:30.800]   And let me just give you one thing that hit the wire this morning, which will show you how bad the
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:38.480]   credit market is. So there was a article in Bloomberg that came out that said, instead of Elon
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.280]   taking marginally,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:46.560]   loans to fund his acquisition of Twitter, there is an idea being floated by Morgan Stanley to use
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.880]   convertible debt. Now, I love this idea, because I think it's an excellent mechanism. This was the,
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.800]   you know, when Elon had convertible debt on Tesla, that was, you know, one big,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.080]   escape velocity moment for me in my career in 2016. So I believe in these products,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.200]   I believe that they work. But the reason I'm bringing this up is that the what it says,
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.840]   is I'll just read this to you, the preferred equity may have a 20 year maturity and include
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:20.000]   a feature allowing interest to be paid in kind at a rate of 14% a year. If the single greatest
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.320]   investors cost of capital for debt in today's market is 14%. I think you have to really start
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.360]   to question what the credit markets really look like for market clearing prices. Because
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.240]   if that's the price for a risk bearing asset, run by the greatest entrepreneur of our generation,
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.120]   there's a bunch of stuff free birth to your point, that's, you know, that's, you know, that's, you
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:45.760]   know, that's pretty mispriced. I think one thing that's a silver lining here is we did build up
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:52.080]   11 million job openings, labor participation is really low right now, even post pandemic.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.520]   People if you ask this question, I think Chamath is like, how are people going to get out of to
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.440]   freebergs point the lifestyle issue like they want to live is a pretty easy solution.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:09.040]   Go back to work, get a second job, start working again, we peaked, you know, in the 90s with
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:17.280]   something around 67% labor force participation. And then we're now you know, just right around 62.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:24.000]   This is a large number of people who could go back to work. Now, you mentioned that slight tick up
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   ever so slight in unemployment claims. We'll see if that goes up. But I think the potential way out
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.440]   here is, is that it's bottom meaning like if you look now the last three or four, right?
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.960]   unemployment claims readings in a row have largely showed
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.280]   that it's floored. And it looks like in the last couple of readings that it's starting to tick up.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.960]   Well, with 3% unemployment, we're kind of on a floor, you can't possibly have
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.760]   less unemployment, unemployment is going up, I think employment has peaked unemployment is going
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.280]   up. And it's exactly what Jamal said, look, all of us in our board meetings last several months,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.000]   really, since the beginning of the year, have been warning founders that the environment is changing.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Don't assume that we're always gonna have a boom in the cash is always going to be there. However,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.880]   nobody's taking the advice. Well, because there's
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.560]   been resistance because people don't want to believe it. And then in addition, it's always
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.000]   like, well, how do you know it's not going to bounce back, right? And now I think after what's
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.680]   happened, really, since April, and really, in the last week or two, I think no one's really saying
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.760]   that anymore. Everyone understands that we're in a new environment. And they just don't die, they
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.520]   have experience with how bad it's going to be, or they don't, but everyone understands things have
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:38.160]   changed. So every company that's that's acting sensibly is freezing their hiring, putting a break
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.800]   on the growth. And then they're like, well, we're going to have to do this again. And then they're
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.280]   like, well, we're going to have to do this again. And then they're like, well, we're going to have to
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.480]   do this again. And then they're like, well, we're going to have to do this again. And then they're
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   slowing down their plans. And that will absolutely translate into less job creation.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:53.840]   Yeah, we've we've really pushed that exact plan. I used to sit down with our founders.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.440]   And in these board meetings, what we would talk about is the base case.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:03.200]   And then we would always talk about a blue sky case and a really bold case, right? So three
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.720]   flavors of kind of like, kind of go and do what you're doing, actually put a little bit more
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.000]   gas on it, and you know, press the gas and then really go for it. I've stopped all of that. You
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.960]   know, these last five months have been me and my founders basically saying, Okay, guys, what's the
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:26.800]   extreme bear case? What's the bear case? And then what's the base case? What's not? And what we are
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.560]   trying to figure out is how do we make sure that we can optimize for a contribution margin for
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.640]   profitability for cash flow? And when that's not possible, how do we minimize burns so that we can
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.680]   extend our runway as long as possible and show technical validation so that we can raise money on
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.560]   reasonable terms, not even great trips. And if the boards of these private companies haven't
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.920]   been doing that for the last five or six months, and the and the burn hasn't dramatically changed,
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.200]   I think that they are, they've been a little derelict in their duty. It's a it's a it's you're
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.520]   not doing a very good job as a board member or investor if you haven't forced these conversations
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.560]   with your CEO. And you shouldn't expect the CEO to bring this to you, in many ways, because
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.360]   it's very hard for them with the with the focus that they have every day to put this front of mind.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:20.000]   But as Zach said, you have to do it as a director, if you're worth the salt at all, you have to do it.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.880]   But it's been quite the opposite. We saw with fast.com. Co was the opposite, right? People
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.520]   were just not even considering it. It's just survival risk is on the table,
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.400]   you really have to act differently. It's kind of like the difference between
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.480]   a poker tournament and a cash game. You know, like players behave very differently in a poker tournament
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.240]   the players are much more conservative. Why? Because once you're out, you're out. So if you
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.600]   lose the wrong hand, you're busted out of the tournament. Whereas in a cash game, you can just
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.240]   rebuy. Well, we've gone from basically being in a cash game where people can just rebuy maybe they
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.440]   won't, you know, they could go out and raise more money, maybe it's not the valuation they want,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.080]   maybe it's not as much they want. But you know, in a boom, you can always go raise more money. Now,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.200]   if there's no more money available, to keep funding your plan, if it's not working, you really have to
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.680]   think about survival. And you have to be more conservative, you can't let yourself bust out of
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.400]   the tournament.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   By the way, I'll say two things on that one, what you're describing is exactly the condition that
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.200]   is now led to the fact that roughly one third of public biotech stocks are trading below cash.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:28.000]   So they're not. Yeah, so their entity value, the biotech industry as a whole sin bio in particular,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.600]   but really biotech. About a third of companies now trade below their cash balance. I'll send
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.320]   you guys some some links on this, Nick, I'll add it to the show notes afterwards. And the
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:48.960]   reason is, yeah, 40% of them have less than 20 months of cash. 60% of them have less than two
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.440]   and a half years worth of cash. And historically, biotech companies, they kind of run an R&D cycle
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.080]   to prove that their biotech product will work. And if it works, there'll be a pharma company that'll
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.600]   swoop in and give them some money to go through the next phase of clinical trials. Or they'll do
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.760]   a secondary offering and raise more money to get through the next phase. But because the capital
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.240]   markets are gone now for them, or the assumptions are gone, they're going to be more likely to go
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.360]   through the next phase of clinical trials. And so the assumption is, hey, there's not going to be
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:16.880]   any capital left, they're still burning, whatever it is 2030 4080 $100 million a quarter, they've
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   only got a few $100 million in the bank. And everyone's like, hey, look, the odds of you guys
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.200]   actually, even if your technology works, even if your product works, the odds of you being able to
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.160]   get the funding to get through the next phase of clinical trials is much lower. Therefore, the the
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.800]   ascribed value of your business is negative. And we're seeing that across the board. I started
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.160]   working in Silicon Valley in 2001. That's when I graduated
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.360]   an investment bank doing tech M&A. And that was right after the.com implosion. Most of what I
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.680]   worked on was public companies that were selling for less than cash. Today, we don't talk about
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.200]   that over the last 20 years, because it just never seems to happen. Well, it's a phenomenal
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.800]   thing to happen, right? I mean, you could basically see what that means is, you could
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.680]   shut the company down and make a profit and still own the IP. So that is what happened in the.com
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.480]   area. Yes, we saw we sold a bunch of companies, I was on the banking side, representing the sellers,
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.080]   the private, the public companies, because there was no business, they were just
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.920]   burning money. And there was no line of sight to making money or line of sight to raising money.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.160]   So the board said, you know what, we just got to get shut it down this thing out, shut it down.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.680]   And then you know, hey, what's cheaper shutting it down, what's gonna make us more money shutting
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.360]   it down and distributing the cash, or letting a private equity firm come in and shut it down for
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.280]   us. And in a lot of cases, they sold these public companies to private equity firms,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.480]   let's say the company's got 100 million in cash, they sold it for 60 million,
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.840]   private equity firm comes in, and they're like, boom, boom, boom, everyone's fired the sink shut
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.000]   down. And they liquidated it and they took you know, made made a $20 million spread on that thing.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.760]   I will say on the on the flip side for private for private markets, and I think this is a really
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:48.000]   important, maybe point for us to have a conversation about over the past decade, as you
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.800]   guys know, there have been more venture money raised than at any time in history, the numbers
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.440]   have been going up every year, the number of funds total capital raised, but at the end of 2021,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.520]   if you look at the total funds raised and the total capital deployed by venture funds,
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.120]   we have a $230 billion capital dry powder hangover. So there's a quarter there's a quarter
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.920]   trillion dollars of capital.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.640]   of cash, sitting in venture coffers that they can call and write the checks into.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.280]   So I think it provides a really interesting contrast that sets us up for a dynamic
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.800]   over the next few years on what's going to happen in private markets. Because you're going to have
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.200]   the haves and the have nots. The haves are going to have a lot of friggin money available to them
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.520]   because these venture funds need to be deployed over the next few years. The have nots are the
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.760]   ones that don't have proof points to a viable outcome in their business. But the haves are
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.840]   going to have a lot of capital available to them with one caveat.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.240]   With one caveat, which is valuation. So what do you guys think will happen?
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.360]   There's two caveats in the context of everyone saying, Hey, there's no capital available,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.720]   there's no capital available. That's not true. There's more capital than has ever been available.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.000]   So how does it get allocated?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.680]   So the first thing is, to Jamath's point, at what valuation and so there's going to need to be
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.400]   disciplined and they're going to do right the that money will go to the winners. Other thing to
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.960]   remember is during the great financial crisis for about a year, maybe even too many venture firms
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.760]   did not want to go to the winners. They were going to go to the winners. They were going to go to the
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:07.840]   winners. And so they were going to go to the winners. And so they were going to go to the winners.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:07.920]   So they were going to go to the winners. And so they were going to go to the winners. And so they
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.040]   capital from LPS, whose portfolios were crushed, and LP said, I know we're on the hook for this.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   But I would appreciate it if you don't make a ton of investments right now, because we don't want to
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.760]   clear our already, you know, demolished portfolios to then fund your venture fund. So those are
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:30.560]   commitments, it's not cash in the bank. And those commitments only come from Harvard, Yale, CalPERS,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.840]   Ford Foundation, whoever more or less on credit Kettering, if the GPS can ask the LPS for that.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.680]   And the last time this happened, and I
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.920]   don't know if it will happen this time. But I think you remember to trauma. The LPS specifically
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.520]   said, Hey, pump the brakes. Yeah, let me build on what you say in 2000. The more extreme measure
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.480]   happened with which is that most of these venture investors returned the money and just cancelled
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.200]   and tore up the LPA. Now, why would they do that? Why would you tear up commitments for
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:03.920]   a quarter trillion dollars? It's because your portfolio is trash. Meaning, if you have made
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.600]   a bunch of horrible investments that you know, are now totally upside down,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.840]   you have a responsibility to manage those investments to a reasonable outcome,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.680]   and ideally even try to get some salvage value. And so you know, it's very hard for you to look
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.440]   at an LP in the eye and all of a sudden say, you know what, I'm going to deploy this fresh capital.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   And I'm in a psychologically good state of mind to do that well.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.520]   And I think that what history shows is that when you have these drawdowns, the money is
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.520]   made by new entrants, or fresh capital, which doesn't have the legacy of a bad portfolio. The
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.320]   returns are not captured by the same people. And the reason is because they have the psychological
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:49.280]   baggage of a horrible portfolio or horrible marks. So for example, there was a tweet and I'll send
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:55.440]   this to you guys. This is from a guy named Matt Turk. He said to put the depth of the reset in
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:04.800]   context to justify a $1 billion value valuation $1 billion valuation. A cloud unicorn today would
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.440]   need to plan on doing 170% of the return on the stock market. And that's the kind of thing that
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:17.920]   is going to happen. So if you apply this current median cloud software multiple of $5.6 times forward
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.120]   revenue, now let's put it in a different way. If you're a company that's worth 10 billion,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:30.960]   that means that you have to come up with $1.78 billion of annual recurring revenue for the market
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   to give you a median multiple. How many SaaS companies and SaaS would sacks you'll know this.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   How many SaaS companies
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.120]   even get close to 2 billion of ARR? Probably a lot less than the number of SaaS companies that
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.240]   are worth 10 billion on paper. So, you know, by the way, we should also talk about who's the
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   bag holder in that transaction. It's the employees and we should we should explain why that is in a
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   second. But just to build on what you know, Jason is saying and freebrook what you're saying is,
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:02.400]   in moments like this, I would ignore all of the dry powder and all of that stuff.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.280]   I think that there are a lot of venture investors today who've deployed way too quickly.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.320]   Jason Wong And if they want to have any reputation
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.640]   over the next 10 years, we'll have to rehabilitate their portfolio and try to return money.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.040]   Jason Wong Let me just say one thing. I saw an analysis
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:24.000]   from one of the biggest venture firms in the valley over a 14 fund cycle. So they looked at data from
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   14 funds. And they showed that 40% of their capital was deployed in businesses that they were chasing
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.360]   valuation meaning like the business wasn't performing well, and they needed to bridge the
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.200]   company or support it through a down payment. Jason Wong
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.040]   And they looked at all of the other companies that were doing that down round, or you know, some other
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.640]   sort of situation where at the time, it was let's support our portfolio 40% of their capital. On that
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:53.280]   40%, they made like 50% losses. So they deployed money in a situation that was not kind of an
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.960]   accelerating, successful, you know, up round kind of business, it was declining business. And in that
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.680]   support, they lost half their money, the other 60%. They make like three x, right? So it kind of
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.120]   averages out that they make kind of whatever it is, two, two and a half x on the whole portfolio.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.000]   But I think it really speaks to the condition that a lot of venture firms may make the mistake
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.960]   around doing over the next couple of years, which is I've got all of these businesses that are
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.120]   suffering through down rounds or need supportive capital. And I know it can get there. But that
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.160]   belief ultimately costs the LPS and costs the fund more. And it's why we saw such negative return
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.920]   cycles happen after the.com crash.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:37.040]   Robert Leonard How about this? Since 1994? Okay, just guess how many funds private equity growth
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   venture funds even existed that are greater than a billion dollars. So this is over, you know,
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.160]   30 years, say, what do you mean? How many funds do you think even existed over a billion dollars
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.120]   since 1994? To today? How many funds? Like how many funds have been raised that are
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.280]   individual funds are the brand names? Yeah, since 1994? How many do you think there are?
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:05.360]   450 1276? Oh, you're including private equity and stuff. Oh, I was gonna venture. Okay, sorry.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.960]   Okay. So now, of those one
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:14.960]   1276 private equity funds, or growth funds, or crossover funds, or got funds? How many do you
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   think have actually managed to return more than 2.3 times the money 2.3 times? 10% 10% 5% 10% 22
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:31.040]   of them like under 2% under 2% Wow. So here's the point that I'm trying to make. Yeah, investing is
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.880]   very hard. In an upmarket, everybody looks like a genius. All of these funds come up
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:44.240]   with all of their nonsensical ways of showing IRRs and all of these fake gymnastics. But the truth is
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.040]   in the data. And what the data says is that in the last 30 years, the minute you get over your
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.880]   ski tips at a billion dollars, very few people know what they're doing. Very few. It's hard.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.080]   It's hard. The multiples compress as you get to bigger deals. And you can't say just where
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:06.000]   the value is. Deny this numerical truth. Yeah. So again, I go back to, you know,
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.680]   the person that's always been talking about this, and who again, may be proven right, yet again,
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:17.520]   is Bill Gurley. You know, everybody would make fun, why is benchmark only raising $450 million?
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:24.000]   Why would they only raise $500 million? And they always were consistent. Because over the last 30
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.440]   or 40 years, over multiple cycles, we have seen that this is the best way to optimize both for
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:36.720]   return, yes, for mental clarity, and for making our LPS happy. Every variable was optimized at around 500%.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:44.000]   And then you see 5 billion, 6 billion, $10 billion funds funding 5 billion, 6 billion,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.520]   10 billion, $20 billion private companies. And I think what we have to do is put two and two together
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.200]   and realize that it's going to be very difficult sledding from here for a lot of folks. And when
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:01.760]   the venture or crossover investor has this mental baggage that they're dealing with, they're not
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.240]   going to be able to provide fundamentally sound advice to the CEO, they're going to optimize for
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.640]   making that profit. And that's why we're talking about the LPS. And then you see 5 billion, 6 billion,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.200]   $100 billion. And if you look at the LPS, it's going to be a very difficult thing. And I think
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:09.760]   that's why we're talking about the LPS. And then you see 5 billion, 6 billion, 6 billion, 7 billion,
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:09.840]   $100 billion. And then you see 5 billion, 6 billion, 6 billion, 7 billion, 7 billion, 7 billion, 7 billion,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.800]   the CEOs will make a bunch of suboptimal decisions. It'll probably lead to a bunch of layoffs,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.760]   bad technology decisions, things slow down. And the cycle is reflexive in that sense. And so,
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.800]   you know, we're going to go through a few years of sorting this thing out.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.560]   Down rounds, liquidation preferences, nonsense, sacks will be
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.520]   yeah, so So look, I agree with that point that these mega funds are very hard to repay, because
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.560]   they require you to have multiple winners, not just winners, but mega winners. So we've always kept our
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.160]   funds in that five to $600 million range where you really only need one winner per fund to basically
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.400]   return the fund. But let me let me go back to this point about you explain the math, explain the math
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:54.480]   of that you typically own 1520% of a winner. So just even less by the time. Right, exactly. So,
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.360]   you know, if you own 10% of one deca corn, that's a billion dollars. And if it's a $500 million fund,
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.480]   you've doubled your fund. But if it's a one or $2 billion fund, you haven't even paid back the
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.560]   fund yet. So that's, I mean, this is how hard is it to hit a deca corn? Hard. It's hard.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:19.840]   Hard, hard, hard, really, really hard to hit to have had to in a decade. Yeah, I've had to an
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.120]   exact same time period to go back to this point about dry powder. So I think it's actually
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.000]   important. So this will be a little bit more of a bright spot. So in a weird way, so there's a,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.840]   I think, stunning article in tech crunch just two days ago, that said that Tiger Global, you know,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.400]   which the head of the company, he's a big fan of Tiger Global, he's a big fan of Tiger Global,
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.840]   hedge fund, as of the end of April, the hedge fund had lost about 45%. And then may the first
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.160]   weeks of May have been even worse. So who knows what they're at now. But they had a separate
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.280]   venture vehicle. And their their history of their venture vehicles is that they raised
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:42:01.040]   3.75 for a fund in 2020, then 6.65 billion in 2021. And then just this year,
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.320]   they closed a $12.7 billion fund in March. Now, I think that fund was raised
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.800]   as early as September last year, but maybe there was some money that still trickled in,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.520]   and they finally closed it in March. But basically, what this article said is that
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:21.600]   this $12.7 billion fund that they just raised is already nearly depleted. It's something like
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.800]   two thirds of the fund has already been deployed. So this idea that they've got like a lot of dry
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.960]   powder sitting on the sidelines, I don't think they do. And then meanwhile, you know,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.240]   the other big crossover funds, D1, Co2, they are completely risk off, I don't think they were ever
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   as aggressive as Tiger. So they're not in as bad shape as Tiger. But they're just basically sitting
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:47.120]   on the sidelines till this thing sorts itself out. So basically, all of this capital that flooded the
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:52.080]   venture markets, this growth capital that came in over the last couple of years, is gone. I mean,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.680]   that's basically dried up. Why did they go so fast,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.560]   Zach? What was their thinking? Because you and I met with these folks, we saw them marking up
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.000]   our companies, because you and I, you typically do a Series A, that's your sweet spot,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.160]   I typically do see it into Series A, you do A into B. They were coming in and marking up our and
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.000]   the BNC rounds. What was their thinking? What was their mistake here?
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.560]   I think the thinking was that we can create an index fund for pre IPO tech companies for sort
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:23.200]   of late stage private tech companies. The only problem was and by the way, they did, if you could,
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.120]   I think they did a good job sort of productizing that solution. I mean, if you send them your
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.800]   numbers in a certain format and do a meeting, they were like a term sheet generator. I mean,
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.760]   they speak out term sheet. Your original idea, Chamath, you had saw you had funding as a surface
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.560]   point. I did this thing called capital as a service where you would send us you would send
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:45.600]   us but you would send us your data or we would plug in to whatever you use, say it was stripe
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.080]   or Shopify, we would suck out the data, we would run it against a bunch of models, we would do a
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.160]   few simple regressions. And then we would just index you and then send you a term sheet. So we
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.440]   did do that all around the world. But we did it on very small dollars. You know, we did $500,000
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.360]   checks 250k checks, it was called capital as a service, it's still a phenomenally good idea. But
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.000]   you would want to keep it. You know, you're going to have to keep it. You're going to have to keep it.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.600]   cure that business for probably 10 years. I would want it to do that on 10 years on my own money.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.320]   You know, 10 1520 3050 million bucks before I would even dare raise LP money around that idea,
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.640]   because it's, I mean, at that point, it's the machines doing the work. And you have to really
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.960]   be sure your models are right. He asked the question sort of what was wrong with it. I think
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.920]   that the thing that was wrong with it actually was just that the public comps were all wrong, right?
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.920]   So they were modeling to the public valuation. These are wrong. Yeah.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   Well, no, it's look, they're hedge fund guys. So they're looking at they're looking at the public
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.960]   valuations. They're looking at the last private rounds, and they see a spread a large spread.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.040]   And they're like, we can arb this. So they go in with a massive amount of money, create a term
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.920]   sheet generator, and they are the spread. The problem is that all the public valuations we now
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:45:00.560]   know were inflated. I actually think they did a reasonably good job in creating a great approach
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.840]   for founders who want late stage capital. If the valuations have been correct, I think it would work.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.880]   Here's the problem. Right now, Peloton and Coinbase are both their market caps are trading
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:17.280]   at lower than their last private market valuation. So let that sink in. Like,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.520]   if you did that last private round, you're underwater big time in those names,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.200]   or I don't know, they were taking their signals from the public markets. And this
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.400]   is the problem with the Fed, and the administration, and Congress basically
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.720]   flooding the zone with all this fake money is that it distorts all the signals in the economy.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.760]   Yes. And then
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.080]   people start making investment decisions that don't work. And then you have this massive
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.360]   correction. How long have we been doing this? How long have we been overfeeding the market? It
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.680]   obviously happened under Biden and Trump. Does it go back to Obama or no?
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:57.520]   Yeah, it started in 2008. Nine with the ballot and troubled asset relief program, which is basically
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   a fund, you know, to create market liquidity, essentially. But what it also did on the heels of
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:13.360]   the great financial crisis was we introduced comfort around this idea of quantitative easing,
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:18.000]   or, you know, having what's called the Fed put, you may hear that a lot, what does that mean,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.040]   which is that when market conditions get too, you know, stiff or rigid or inflexible,
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:31.120]   the Fed will generally step in with liquidity, typically into the credit market, never into
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.600]   the equity market. But what that does is that that also still flows into the equity market. So,
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.560]   you know, everybody behaves like there's a downside price at which the Fed is guaranteed to act and
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.440]   that really started to be a bailout that really started to be in people's psychology after the
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.640]   great financial crisis. And then through the, you know, 2010s, we had several instances
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.960]   where we had that where we had moments of sort of like market volatility.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.400]   And all along the way, what we also had were academics that started to, you know,
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.960]   promote things like modern monetary theory, this idea that, you know, money printing was a good
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.520]   idea.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.600]   And so we had this, again, very reflexive loop where, you know, anointed experts, you know,
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.720]   you know, did talk pieces and thought pieces and books, and then pseudo intellectuals would parrot
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:21.200]   this stuff. And then, you know, the government infrastructure would behave like this was a
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.520]   reasonable thing to do. And it built on itself for a decade. So we've been doing this for 13 or 14
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.320]   years now. And now we're trying to undo it and put the genie back in the bottle. And it's proving
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.000]   much, much harder than we thought, because people have unfortunately got addicted to the crack,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.440]   they're addicted to the drug, they, you know, they're addicted to the drug.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.760]   You're trying to take the oxy away. And that's a and people are going to go through
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.200]   withdrawal, really, really bad withdrawal.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.600]   If you have a quarter trillion dollars of dry powder, let's assume no one gives their money
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.200]   back. And they don't do stupid stuff like chase losing companies in their portfolio.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.800]   And they allocated in a smart way to winning companies. Does that not mean that we end up
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:05.360]   seeing a significantly kind of outsized amount of capital going to a few highly successful businesses?
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:11.440]   That will end up seeing this kind of supercharging of a small set of businesses as opposed to this
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.880]   rise of the unicorn, which is what we saw over the past call it, you know, eight, seven, eight years,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:22.720]   and that you have this big bifurcation in the market, the VC market starts to kind of say,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.080]   hey, you're not making money, you don't have a line of sight to making money, you're off the
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.600]   table. But the, you know, top decile get overfunded, and they become, you know, kind of
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.480]   the next the next mega caps. No, yeah, I mean,
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.560]   it does not happen in this moment.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.800]   Well, so look, if we look ahead two or three years, I had a
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.760]   Can I just tell you why? Let's take let's take the perfect company, which is stripe.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.800]   Okay, so now $50 billion.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.600]   Well, they've been funded to a mega cap, right? I mean,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.240]   $50 billion of horrible VCs who have made horrible decisions heretofore,
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.360]   knocking on the call us a store saying, Can you please take my $50 billion? Because I'm
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.400]   trying to be money good. Why did the call us ins want to take on this headache? Why did
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:10.880]   they want to flutter, you know, mess set their cap table up with all these folks, and then at what
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.920]   price. So if you're sitting at the board of any really good, well run company, of course, you'll
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.560]   take some bite size, you know, amounts of very decisive capital in these moments, if you think
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.360]   you can market consolidate or whatever. But I think the point that all of these companies are
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.480]   going through is largely the same. If the best companies aren't doing what we just talked about,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.320]   I would be shocked as well. The best companies are thinking, let's batten down the heckle.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:40.560]   hatches. And let's not distract ourselves. And so I'm not sure this is the moment where a really
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.800]   horrible VC who's had a terrible track record who's just blundered through $5 billion is going
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.560]   to be able to put in a billion dollars to strike. What do you think,
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.080]   Sachs? Let me speak to kind of the environment that I think is going to happen over the next
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:00.240]   few years and then what founders will succeed. I think you're right, freeberg that the VCs are
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.240]   gonna become much more discriminating. And there's going to be a much more polarized outcome.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.400]   Here for companies. I had a tweet storm that Elon actually gave a nice boost to by saying he agreed
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.200]   with it where I basically said, look, startups with high growth and moderate burn will get funded
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.080]   through this downturn. Starts with moderate growth and high burn will not get funded.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.520]   So what's going to happen is that the sort of mediocre ones are going to, we're going to get
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.080]   to a very polarized outcome very quickly, where, you know, I think a lot of founders think that
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.160]   if their numbers are just okay, and not great, then they'll be able to raise but at a lower
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.080]   valuation, or they'll be able to raise something, but maybe not as much as they wanted. And what
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.120]   will happen is, the middle cases kind of go away in an environment like this. And everyone just
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   wants to fund the best companies. So certain things will become absolutely fatal for startups
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.640]   in this environment. One is obviously if they're just not growing, they're not gonna be able to
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.320]   raise and good growth really starts in the early stages in terms of doubling year over year. Second,
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:04.080]   negative or low gross margins are absolutely fatal. Nobody wants to fund businesses that may not even be real
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.600]   businesses. And I would say acceptable gross margins really start at 50%. Third,
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.720]   CAC payback, people want to know that you can pay back your customer acquisition costs in
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:21.040]   a year or less. And then like I mentioned, the burn, you know, a burn multiple of one is really
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:27.520]   ideal where you're burning not more than your net new ARR, but certainly not more than two,
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.280]   I think burn multiples over two, where you're spending, you're burning $2 to add $1 of growth,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.400]   that's where I think, you know, companies start becoming unfundable. So I think founders are going
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:45.920]   to have to pay a lot more attention to these disqualifiers. Yep. But I think that for companies
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:53.360]   who meet the criteria, who have good growth, low burn, good business fundamentals, they will be able
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.880]   to raise and look, here's what's going to happen. The crossover investors are washed out of the system,
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.920]   they're gone. I mean, Tiger's already deployed all of its capital. I don't know when they're gonna be back. So the
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.560]   so called tourist money, the, the basically the big investors who weren't in the system,
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.120]   a few years ago, they're basically going to leave the system. However, there will be the big
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.880]   traditional venture funds will have large funds, but they're going to deploy them much more slowly,
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:22.560]   these one year pace of deployments, they're going to stop. They'll be back to three. Exactly. So just
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.520]   think about that, even if you had the same amount of money being raised and deployed,
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.440]   but it was happening over three years instead of one, that would be a two thirds reduction
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.840]   in the availability of capital in the system. So which
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.400]   was that going to go to? You're not putting that in the best companies I'm talking about,
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.360]   you're not going to go to somebody who's going to blow through it in nine months,
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.680]   who's playing every hand, like you cannot play that way anymore. Exactly. So what we're telling
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.160]   our founders is number one, you got to lengthen your runway, like the days of raising a new round
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.360]   every 12 months are over, you got a plan on not raising for two to three years, if you can help it.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.840]   And then you really have to sharpen your pencil and work on these business fundamentals. And,
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.760]   you know, one thing you need to do is you need to have a realistic conversation
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.480]   about, am I really able to raise another round in this environment with the metrics I currently have?
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.320]   And if the answer is no, you need to cut your burn to give yourself the time to fix the business. And
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:19.600]   that fixing a business normally takes two to three years. So you know, if you got less than two years,
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.080]   or even two and a half years of burn, and you have one of those disqualifiers I talked about,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.240]   you better like cut your burn quickly to give yourself the time to fix those disqualifiers.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.680]   Yeah, I mean, I wish people we've been talking about this for a year, folks. And you know, some
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:40.000]   founders just are not accepting the reality of the situation. And I if you look at what happened,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.560]   we have a generation that's never experienced a down market. And these down markets happen so
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:50.400]   violently, that they think like people are panicking, you know, somebody made a joke like,
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.560]   Bill Gurley is called five of the last three recessions, you know, and it's like,
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:00.080]   well, I mean, we have scar tissue. And it's that the the velocity of the downturn,
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.600]   all those kids dunking on girly, well, guess who's gonna have the last laugh, I think,
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.640]   precisely, I texted Gurley last night, he's had the last thought. I literally DM to last night,
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:14.560]   I said, Listen, the water's great. Right now, I am doing deals back at six to $12 million in the seed
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:21.040]   space. With, you know, 200k in revenue and real founders and discipline, start investing again,
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.400]   it's great now. Because the deals are now taking I don't know if you're experiencing the sacks.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.960]   But the deals went from taking two, three days. Now they're back up to four to six weeks.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.520]   And we're having very thoughtful discussions. We're
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   meeting a third time with founders, we're talking about their go to market strategy,
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.400]   we're getting to talk to three or four customers, I had founders,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.600]   who said you can't be in this deal if you want to talk to my customers. And that wasn't one founder,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.400]   multiple founders said, if you want to talk to our customers, then you don't get an allocation.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.680]   And I said, Okay, the thing to keep in mind, I won't do the deal. But that was how dysfunctional
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.920]   this was, Chima. The thing to keep in mind is that all these late stage companies are mispriced,
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.640]   doesn't matter whether you're the bottom decile or the top decile.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:09.760]   You are massively mispriced. And there needs to be some correction between 30 and 70% on valuation.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.680]   How do you solve it?
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.720]   I have a point of view on that, actually, because so look, there's a major difference, I think,
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:22.720]   between evaluation, multiple collapse in the public markets for a supplier market, it's gone
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.040]   down, look, the SAS valuation multiples have gone down 70 80%. There's no disputing that.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:33.360]   Look, it used to be the public markets were trading at 15%.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.720]   Now, it's 15 times ARR for the median SAS company announced 5.6. So yeah, we're talking about
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:44.880]   two thirds 70 80% reductions. If it happened in the public stocks, it deserves to happen in the
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.240]   private stocks to Chima's absolutely right about that. And a lot of people aren't recognizing that
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.440]   fact. However, here's the difference. The median SAS company is growing maybe 15 to 20%.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.560]   When you've lost 80% of your value, and you're only growing 15 to 20%, it's going to take you
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.280]   a decade to grow back into your old valuation. However, private good private companies, not all
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.720]   of them, but the great ones, they're still growing 3x year over year. So if you're able to grow 3x year
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:14.480]   over year, and you do it two years in a row, you're 9x where you were, even if the ARR multiple
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:20.000]   collapse 80%, you can still get an up round, it's not going to be the 9x up round, it might be a
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.440]   2x up round. I know how that's mathematically true. But listen, if you're a hundred million
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:33.200]   dollar ARR business, let's just say you were able to raise at 10 or 11 billion. Yes, you're mathematically
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:40.400]   right that, you know, 100 million times nine is 900 million. But I think it's important to first
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.520]   say how many actual software companies are there that generate a billion dollars of ARR? Do you
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.520]   remember when Salesforce first passed a billion dollars of ARR? We thought my gosh, and then they
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:56.400]   said my blood. So this is exceptionally rare error. And I think that it behooves people to
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:03.120]   understand that law of large numbers aren't often violated. And so you know, before you go and
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.680]   do that simple math and convince yourself that it's possible, maybe you should actually not I'm
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.440]   not saying that to you, Sax, I'm saying that to the founder or to the boards, maybe you guys should
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.320]   actually just go in and have somebody run a screen and say, how many actual companies exist that have
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.640]   actually managed to generate more than a billion dollars of ARR, especially in a moment where people
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:26.560]   are cutting back on spend? How does that happen? So yeah, look, I agree, getting from 100 to a
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.280]   billion is really hard. You know, if you're a billion dollar company supposed to do because
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.040]   in this math, they have to get to 200 billion dollars.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:33.120]   I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:38.160]   billion dollars of ARR to be worth 10 billion. I do think a lot of how do we do that? How does
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:43.840]   the random task company that you and I have never heard of? How do they generate 2 billion of ARR? I
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.520]   can tell you the handful of companies that generate 2 billion of ARR. There are some incredible
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:53.280]   companies today that don't even yet, you know, like, look at an incredible company like unity.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:59.360]   Incredible, the backbone of all you know, gaming and, you know, the move to 3d. This year, if they
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.960]   crush, they'll do 1.3 billion. Incredible.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:09.520]   business. It's an incredible, it just went down 35%. This went down 35%. It's unbelievable.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.160]   It's trading at four times revenue guys. Right? Some of these things are hard to believe,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:20.640]   like Opendoor has 2.3 billion in cash and a $3.7 billion market cap, enterprise value 1.4. And they
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:25.200]   I think they also have a couple of billion in real estate, Coinbase 6 billion cash $12 billion market
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   cap. So I guess in this part in the discussion, even with all these headwinds, can we give the
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.880]   protective mechanisms for employees?
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.800]   Because I again, I just Okay, good, good point. Let's do it. Let's do it. When you start a company
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.000]   and you're a founder, you have, you're taking the most risk, you're the person with the idea,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.760]   you should be justly rewarded for that. The way that that happens,
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.200]   economically in a company is you get founder shares,
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:56.800]   the basis of those founder shares are effectively zero. And you're able to do a bunch of structuring
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:02.800]   when you first start a company that gives founders specifically some incredible tax advantages.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.520]   You can, you know, do an 83 B election, which is effectively you buying the stock,
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:14.080]   starting the clock on long term capital gains, etc, etc. Then you have stock that you give to
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:19.760]   employees, they're one of two kinds, non qualified stock options and incentivize stock options,
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:26.160]   NSOs and ISOs. And you know, those have different tax treatments. But again,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:31.840]   you know, when you're a very early employee, you get a mixture of these things also hugely accretive,
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:39.680]   it has a very low basis, you're building value. But here's what people don't understand. When a
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:45.840]   venture investor like myself or Jason explain basis, by the way, for people, for basis,
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.960]   your your price of your stock is effectively zero, you know, like a penny for it or something. Yeah,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.920]   like, like the my stock at Facebook costs like half a penny. Got it. You know, whatever.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.800]   It goes public, it's 15 $20, you get the spread, got it,
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.640]   you get the spread. And you pay long term capital gains on that if you've been able to,
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:09.760]   not in context, and and shifted to long term capital gains. Okay. So now,
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:15.360]   Sachs or Jason or myself come and invest in your company, what happens, we actually don't get
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:20.960]   equity, we don't get common stock, we actually get a synthetic form of debt called the preferred
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:26.240]   share. Okay. And typically, the way that it works is when we invest in a company,
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:32.560]   and this is how the entire venture ecosystem works. We actually create what's called a preference
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:40.080]   stack, which means we get an instrument that is senior to the common equity. Now, what does that
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:45.760]   mean? Well, it means that if your business goes out of business, we get our money back first,
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.800]   we also get an interest rate. And we're able to convert all of that at some point,
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.680]   the magical moment when a company goes public into common stock, and we give up our preferred rights.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.840]   And we now have the same instrument as everybody else when a company goes public. That's the
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.480]   typical mechanism.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.480]   Why does that exist? By the way, the preferred shares maybe explaining the why,
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.080]   why do VCs need that protection?
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   To be honest with you, I don't know why it started. But it's a historical artifact
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.400]   of, you know, the 1960s and 70s.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.880]   I think I know why it started. Okay, so this got lawyered, because let's say you start a company.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.960]   And just to use some round numbers, a investor wants to give you $10 million to start the company
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.400]   and for 10% of the company $100 million valuation. If you didn't have preferred shares,
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.440]   then the founders could basically on the day after the money comes, they could say,
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.640]   hey, we want to liquidate the company, we decided we don't want to do this anymore.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.400]   And they own 90% of the company. And they could basically then distribute out the 10 million
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.320]   to all the shareholders, and they would keep nine, and 1 million would go back to the investor.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:48.720]   Right.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.880]   So that's why lawyers came up with this idea of seniority. So that okay, if you disband the
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.000]   company, with the investors money still in there, it goes back first to the people who put in the
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.200]   money. That was the idea.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.320]   And when the second person who put it in the money, that was the idea.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.160]   piece was if the company gets sold for less than the cash put into it, at least the people with the
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.960]   cash and get their money out first. So if it sells for 10 million, you get your 10 million back or
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.840]   11, you get 1 million after that. So let's just say Jason does the first million. So there now
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   there's a million of preferred, then Saks does the series A and he puts in 10. Now there's 11 million
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.840]   of preferred even if it's at a much higher valuation. And then I come in and I give 100
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:32.240]   at an even higher valuation. So now there's $111 million of preferred shares. Now,
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.520]   if the company goes through all kinds of complications and mess, and let's just say
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.480]   we have to sell it to somebody else for $200 million. Well, guess what happens the first
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.800]   111 of it comes back to myself, Jason and David, plus interest. So this is why venture investors
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.600]   have an incentive to pay and set these crazy valuations because they don't really care what the
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:02.160]   valuation is, as much as they care how much of all this preference is building. And do I believe that
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.920]   the liquidation value of the company is at least that much money. So if I think that freebrook's
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.440]   companies worth at least $111 million, I'll do it and I add my 100. Now, why is this important
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.040]   for employees? Before you join a startup, especially in this moment, I think it's very
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.680]   important for you to understand how much money have they raised? How much is this preference
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:32.080]   stack that exists? And do you believe that the company is going to be worth much more than that?
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.680]   Because that's the only way that you're going to actually participate in the equity. And we know now
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.400]   what the public market say. So if you go back to that tweet, you know, if it's a 10 or an $11
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.800]   billion company, okay, well, you need to generate $2 billion of revenue. And if you're at 100
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.720]   million, that means you have to 20x the revenue for the valuation to be worthwhile, for you to
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.840]   believe that this valuation is real. So this is just a little guide for employees, I just think
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.000]   it's very important that you guys start to do the math and start to think about what you're going to
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.360]   start to figure this out. Ask the hard questions. How many shares are outstanding? How many preferred
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.920]   shares? What's the overhang? What's my strike price preference stack? Yes, you know, how much
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.680]   is the total prep stack? How much revenue are we generating? Now, you should go and do the work to
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:22.560]   figure out what the public market comps are. Those are widely available. Hopefully somebody could
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.800]   actually just create a website that helps you do this. But all of these things are going to be very
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.920]   important for you. Otherwise, what will happen is if you join a company in this moment, at a fake
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:37.600]   valuation, and the valuation gets reset, you can effectively assume your options are worth zero.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.840]   So if that was a important part of how you made the decision to join that company,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   you're being somewhat misled in a moment like this. And you need to have your own
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.040]   rational sense of what that company is worth. Conversely, I think boards and CEOs have a real
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.880]   responsibility now to do the hard work of resetting this and explaining it to their
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.840]   employees if they want to retain them. Because in a moment like this, if you have a valuation reset,
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.240]   you don't allow people to understand it, and you don't figure out a way to allow them to participate
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.920]   in some incremental way, I think it's going to be very problematic for employee retention.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.320]   Okay, you know, in those contexts, look,
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.640]   there's a couple things that I always support. You know, if if you need to reprice the options,
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.840]   you know, you can reprice the options and give employees the benefit of a new 49a. So the company
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:31.040]   doesn't set the option price that's set by an external 49a audit. But if that 49a goes down,
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:37.360]   because of these factors we're talking about, you can basically the board can vote to reprice
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.000]   everyone's options. So at least they get the benefit of the lower
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.400]   explain what a 49a is just broad strokes.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:49.840]   It's basically when stock options are issued, the law requires that the strike price of the
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.400]   option be the fair market price. And because of some accounting
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:01.680]   shenanigans a while back that got companies in trouble, it is now the case that companies don't set
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:09.440]   the fair market price. They go out, and they get some external auditor to do a 49a audit and then
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.480]   the 49a that gives you the fair market price. And specifically, it's a fair market price, the common
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.200]   stock, because what investors are buying is the preferred, because of the dynamic that Chamath is
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:25.440]   talking about where the preferred gets paid back first, the common stock is worth less per share,
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.560]   because it's got this overhang.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.600]   Typically a fraction, a fifth, a 10th, something in that range is typically so if the shares were
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:37.520]   worth a dollar preferred, the fair market value of the common could be five cents, 10 cents, 15 cents
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.120]   depends on if the company is going to run out of money, how many months of runway they have,
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.000]   are they profitable. And so it is a fair thing to do and but you have to know that in a down market
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.280]   like this. If you had massive compression, boards need to look at that founders need to look at and
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:57.440]   say, Hey, listen, if the if the SAS multiples come down so much, well, our fair market value
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.520]   should come down that much, the fair market value might be worth 50% less 75%.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.480]   That's correct, sex.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.680]   Yeah, I mean, so the way it works is that when a company IPOs, you get rid of all the different
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   classes of stock, you know, the everything, basically, the preferred converts to common
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.000]   in an IPO, one class of shares. Yeah, maybe you have like the dual stocks of the founder
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.600]   can maintain control. But from an economic perspective, you basically collapse into
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:26.480]   common stock. So when you IPO, common and preferred are the same. And so economically,
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.440]   they're converging to one to one as the company gets more and more mature and heads towards an exit
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:38.800]   exit. The earlier that you are, the riskier the company is, the more that the prep stack matters,
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.920]   the more overhang that creates. But the benefit to employees is it creates a larger discount
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.640]   on their strike price on the foreign nine a so that is the offsetting benefit. If the foreign
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.240]   nine a goes down, because the markets change, then the board can vote to apply a new foreign
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:59.840]   nine h the employees. That's a beneficial thing to do for everybody. So that's something you know,
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.360]   I've always supported. The other thing is, you know, I've always supported the other thing is,
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.080]   and if you're in a turnaround situation where you're actually worried that the prep stack is
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.480]   larger than the value of the company, in other words, more money has gone into the company,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.800]   then the company may be worth an exit, then what you need to do because then then there's
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:20.240]   nothing for the employees, there's no incentive anymore, what you need to do is create a,
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:27.200]   basically, an employee participation, you create a corridor, where you say, okay, 30%
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.280]   of any acquisition price for this company is going to go to the employees, you
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.600]   create a management or employee carve out, really, it should be an employee carve out,
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:41.200]   not just management, but all the employees of the company should benefit from an acquisition.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.680]   And sometimes you'll see boards be either unrealistic or stingy, they'll be kind of
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.120]   Pennywise and pound foolish, they won't create the incentive for the employees to get that sort
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.400]   of over capitalized company across the finish line. And, you know, it can be pretty frustrating
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:01.200]   to see when that when that happens. It's a good time for employees to understand this is a giant
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.920]   reset that's occurring. I think there is some good news here. I think we have a lot more people
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.240]   who are going to go back to work because they need to. And that'll be good for monetary velocity,
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   fill these jobs 11 million jobs, I don't know if we've ever had this, I think it's a record,
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.080]   the number of jobs we've had, and we're bouncing along record low unemployment. Those two things
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.320]   could be what saves us could save us during this recession. It's something distinctly unique about
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:31.120]   this recession is job openings and low unemployment. We've never had a recession like this.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.320]   So that's just fascinating in of itself. But for employees, and for companies,
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.240]   the new discipline might be there's not going to be four or five offers for every tech employee,
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.040]   if people are going to cut 10 to 25%. This is the contagion moment. And I think maybe just
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.880]   talking about layoff contagion in tech and how that works, because Facebook's on a hiring freeze.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.440]   And you're starting to see the series BC companies all do 10 to 25% layoffs.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.320]   Uber, Dara said, we're going to look at hiring as a luxury, that's probably not going to happen.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.040]   And Apple, stunningly, I don't know if you're watching this, they have told people, we're one
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.840]   day a week now, two days a week in two weeks. And then by the end of this month, May, there'll be
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.320]   three days a week in the office mandatory, the head of machine learning said, Yeah, that doesn't work
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.960]   for my team. And they said, Okay. And he said, Okay, we don't have to do it. And they said,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.040]   no, we're going to hire you. And they said, No, we're going to hire you. And Apple said,
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.960]   no, we're going to hire you. And Apple said, No, we're going to hire you. And Apple said,
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.600]   no, okay, we accept your resignation. So I think even the mighty Apple with unlimited cash reserves
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.280]   are saying, you know what, if we have to shed some people who don't want to come back to the office,
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.760]   that's like a de facto layoff. So maybe talking about this contagion, because if you're a company
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.840]   that doesn't lay off people, you're gonna look pretty weird in this market to your investors.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.320]   And they're gonna be wondering, why aren't you laying people off? Go ahead, free burn.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.600]   I feel like an old guy now been working in Silicon Valley for 20 years, 20, 21 years.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.880]   And I remember, like, you know, one, there was kind of this period of time when there was a bunch of
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.080]   layoffs and a bunch of companies, reduced headcount. And, you know, there were other
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.720]   industries and people stayed employed. And then in the years that followed, like web two happened,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.640]   and people kind of came back. But what was interesting is like the tech industry,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:20.320]   which at the time was Silicon Valley, but is now fairly kind of, you know, well dispersed,
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.720]   attracted a lot of people from other industries, right? It used to be cool to get a job in financial
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.440]   services or investment banking out of college. And then all of a sudden,
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.800]   working at a startup was the cool thing. And there are a lot of people that move from New
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.880]   York in the last couple years to SF, leading up to the most recent crash after the pandemic.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:43.600]   And so, you know, look, there is an ebb and a flow in and out of this industry. I do think
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.240]   that this capital overhang, however, this quarter trillion dollars of dry powder that's sitting in
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.400]   VC coffers is going to be significantly stimulatory in a very good way. I think
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.160]   it will create real jobs and enable real progress. It's not just about the companies
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.720]   that are on the brink of profitability, or the companies that are profitable.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.880]   I think it's going to be a really important step for the future.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.920]   If you take a step back, Jake, how you said something earlier that I thought was kind of
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.480]   a really important statement, which is like you're doing deals, right? You're making investments
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.200]   in startups.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.080]   I'm more excited than I've been in years. This is my time. This is what I love.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:24.800]   It's time to go. And so I talked earlier about how the capital stimulants that came out
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.640]   from the Fed and, and the and the bond buying they were doing and so on, led to an inflation and a bunch
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.440]   of assets and that capital ultimately didn't find its way into productive assets. But it's not about
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.000]   all of that capital finding its way into productive assets. If enough of it find its way into
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.480]   productive assets, productive assets, meaning businesses that create something of value for
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:50.320]   customers and make money doing so, and as a result can grow and create new jobs and create new areas
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.520]   of the economy. If that happens enough times over, there's enough growth in the economy and
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.160]   enough new jobs that are created, that really rationalizes all of the money that was friggin
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:00.560]   wasted.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.200]   on speculative nonsense over the past few years. And I think the fact that we've got a quarter
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.760]   trillion dollars sitting in VC coffers more than we've ever had, that's a quarter trillion dollars
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.600]   ready to fund the next generation of technology businesses that can build new jobs and create new
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.400]   areas of the economy, new areas of growth that we've never seen before. And that's what's happened
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:20.880]   in the past.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.480]   How do you think a person let's just say you're playing poker,
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.480]   and you just get punched in the face, seven rounds in a row, you're stuck three buy ins,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.800]   how does that person make that good next decision? Now,
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.720]   I will tell you three stories from my last week, because my last week has been filled with
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.160]   these experiences. All right, sorry, go ahead.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.680]   So let me let me just talk about the the business of investing in the psychology of investing.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:52.960]   So look at probably who has been the most incredible performer this year is Ken Griffin
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.400]   and Citadel. And right underneath him is this guy is the Englander who runs a place called
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   Millennium. And then you know,
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.880]   a close third would probably be Stevie Cohen at SEC. Now, how do these guys run their business,
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.640]   they have hundreds and hundreds of teams investing in all kinds of different things.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:18.240]   And what they figured out over time is how to dial up and dial down
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:25.040]   the volume of who's performing. And what they have realized is that when you go through a
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.320]   pattern of losing money, it is very difficult for you to then make incremental gains.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.160]   And so you have to be very careful about that. And then you have to be very careful about the
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.280]   amount of money that you're going to lose. And then you have to be very careful about the amount
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.920]   of money that you're going to lose. And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.280]   that you're going to lose. And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money that you're
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.680]   going to lose. And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money that you're going to lose.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.000]   And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money that you're going to lose.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.320]   And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money that you're going to lose.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.160]   And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money that you're going to lose.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.200]   And then you have to be very careful about the amount of money that you're going to lose.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.880]   Jason Wong I personally don't think so,
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.600]   operating across the entire lifecycle. And I think that there's something to be said,
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.680]   and I saw it in 2000, folks who have lost a lot of money, make incrementally poor decisions. I think
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:12.480]   why Jason is firing a little bit of a hot hand was he mostly let his companies get marked up. And he
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.280]   was mostly frustrated the last couple years in valuations.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.240]   Jason Young Early stage valuations, lack of discipline.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.040]   Jason Wong He's operating effectively in slate.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.120]   Jason Wong But I don't think it's a binary condition
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.840]   Chamath. I think generally what you're saying is right. I'll tell you the reaction I'm seeing in
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.320]   the market.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.880]   Chamath Krupa One last thing to add to your thing. And on top of that,
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.800]   there are only seven or eight people who've actually made money in this entire market.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.680]   Jason Wong Yeah.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.600]   Chamath Krupa Early stage investors have done well. Early
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.480]   stage investors have done.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.560]   Jason Wong We returned our first fund. That was nice.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.440]   Chamath Krupa Yeah, I'm in the black.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.000]   Jason Wong Stacks, you, Gurley. I mean, what about all the other thousands of people that raise
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.040]   Chamath Krupa You gotta distribute. People don't distribute shares. We've talked about this a couple
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.440]   of times Chamath. Like it's so hard to make money. And you when you have a chance to distribute, I
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.800]   feel really good.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.440]   Chamath Krupa I've been wanting to talk about some of these companies. You know,
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.680]   I have a Bloomberg at my desk. And one thing that I look at every now and then is the ownership table
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.960]   of some of these high flying stocks. And you'll see some incredible things, which is these folks
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:17.680]   have held on. And they are holding billions of dollars now of paper losses that they have to
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.960]   go back to their LPs and say, hard conversation, Mrs. Foundation, I know that you wanted to fund
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:29.440]   cancer research. You know, I had $9 billion of gains, and now it's two. Oops.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.000]   Gurley So look, I think what you're saying generally is right.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.800]   People are psychologically tainted when they take a big hit in the face. Everyone has this
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:45.200]   experience. My observation over the past two weeks, I have seen a lot of PMs and public
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:52.880]   PMs, portfolio managers, as well as private VCs, all react to me in the same way when opportunities
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.480]   have kind of been discussed, which is I'm sitting on my hands. I mean, there was a PM I saw this week
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:05.520]   of a, you know, anyway, I would say I've never seen him jarred. Like I've never seen him just
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.520]   shocked. Like we were talking about something that was so obviously up his alley, you know,
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.160]   such a great fit for him, but he is just not doing anything.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.520]   David Because they're worried about
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.800]   careerists now. So I mean, I had I had a crossover investor told me told me that, look,
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.480]   I think that things are oversold right now. This is an attractive time.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.440]   Gurley But they won't take an act.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.240]   David Right. Because because look, if I'm right,
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.080]   that they're oversold, and it goes up, great, I make a little bit of money. But if I'm wrong,
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.520]   I'm not just losing money. I'm risking I'm risking my career.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.880]   Gurley I'm catching falling knives.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.200]   David Yeah. So why would I do that? I'm just gonna sit and wait.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.560]   Gurley I'm the opposite right now. Yeah.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:47.440]   David Guys, the same is true in VC. So I had several VCs this week, who kind of shared the
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.880]   same point of view, which is at our partnership meetings. I don't know what you guys are doing,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.360]   Sachs at your fund. But they're like, at our partnership meetings, we just cannot align on
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.600]   whether or not we're paying the right valuation. And so we're at a standstill. We're just waiting
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.760]   to see when the quote market settles out. And then we'll make decisions because I don't want to be
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.680]   the guy in the VC context catching knives. But look, that's a near term psychological phenomenon.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.040]   I think the reaction Chamath is everyone sitting on their hands. But over time,
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.280]   Gurley It's not I just told you the data
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:20.800]   for the last 30 years, only 22 out of 1300 funds have returned more than 2.3 times
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.600]   a billion dollars. It's not near term.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.360]   David That's not the point I was I was trying to
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.720]   make earlier, which was there's a quarter trillion dollars. We got that point about the fact that
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.840]   there is going to be funding available. It doesn't matter if these guys are going to make money or not,
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.080]   or they're going to make shitty investments or not. There is going to be a stimulatory effect,
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.000]   all you need is one of the next trillion dollar mega caps to emerge from the quarter trillion
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.720]   that sitting and then will be the entire industry look fantastic. And for that business to transfer
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.080]   into the next trillion. And then we're going to have to transform the landscape of some part of
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:00.320]   the VC jobs to be created. I think it's but we've but we've never by the way, we've never seen that
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.160]   in history. We've never had this much dry powder sitting on the sidelines. And this is where the
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.640]   free money should go. It should go to creating new companies that create new jobs. And it is
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.280]   it's found its way there. The trillions of dollars that have fueled crazy asset bubbles left and
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.560]   right. Some amount of it made its way into funding the creation of new companies that are going to
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.640]   create jobs. And that is the good thing of what's happened over the last couple of years.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.000]   Despite the asset implosion of all these bubbly things that have happened.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.120]   Amazing. Shamath, I wanted to answer your question. So what do you do if you get punched
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:31.680]   in the face seven times you're running bad in a poker game? Yeah, if you look at Phil Hellmuth,
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:36.400]   or other people who you know, go through that variance, I think what will you take a break,
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:40.160]   go for a walk around the pool, and you did pick a different smaller game.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.360]   One thing I like to think about is, hey, I'm going to play a better play better cards to
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:50.560]   start your hand, and maybe play in position and in in the analogy here, playing better cards,
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.120]   you know, backing better founders and better products, and then playing a position knowing
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.080]   we're in the lifecycle of a company value is created, and that goes to valuation. So I'm laser
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.960]   focused right now on just, you know, world class teams that are running their business as well, and
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.840]   that I can invest in early and if there are founders out there, like who are trying to figure
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.480]   this out, and they're not getting funding, I think looking I think you said this last week, maybe two
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.680]   weeks ago, and listen, your last valuation last year is a great valuation this year. And if you
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.480]   had people
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.600]   who wanted to invest last year who couldn't get in, going back to your $30 million valuation last
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.680]   year, and topping off 3 million with the people who couldn't get in, and you told them, you know,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.160]   I'll come back to you when it's 90 million, go see if they still want to put that bet in. And then for
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.080]   the VCs are out there in the early stage, you know, making bets on sub $15 million, sub $12
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:46.560]   million companies in the seed round. If they're focused on customers and product, you know,
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.400]   got a couple of 100k in revenue, it's I think it's a good bet. And I
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:56.000]   I'm going to increase our investing in those type of companies under 20 million under 15 million
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.440]   focus teams who understand that the climate has changed. If you're not taking the medicine,
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.120]   you have to Saks is excellent tweetstorm, you're DQ from funding, I think it's very
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.400]   important that people understand what Saks said. If you do not accept the reality of VC who has
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.520]   lived through one, two or three of these cycles is going to disqualify you and they're not telling
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.320]   you why they're disqualifying you. It's just not a fit. Couldn't get my point.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.680]   Partners around it. You know, let's keep in touch. Let me know how it could be helpful.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:29.520]   The other thing is an entire generation of investors have been coddling entrepreneurs.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.480]   And in moments like this, sometimes you need to actually have hard conversations. And if
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.160]   that's true, yes, I don't know how you tell that entrepreneur, listen, you need to be
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:43.920]   actually five days a week. In the office, you need to do a 25% riff, you need to stop all the
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:50.240]   extraneous spend, forget the exposed brick walls and the kind bars, we need to get down to just
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:56.000]   ones and zeros. That's also an entire generation of capital, capital allocators who don't know how
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.080]   to do this job in a moment like this. They've never had those conversations. They've never
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.880]   had those conversations. Just to build on Friedberg's point, the idea that you would be at
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:10.800]   a standstill about price in a moment like this, to me is shocking. If I mean, if I was an LP,
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.440]   in that venture fund, I would write it to zero, there should be no
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.240]   intellectual standstill whatsoever in a moment like this.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.160]   Right. Yeah.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.200]   We're still investing.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.400]   It's obvious what the prices are.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.040]   Yeah, we're still investing. It's just that lower valuations.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.280]   There should be no standstill. Exactly. This is the time to invest, Sachs, right? I mean,
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.760]   Yeah, I want to say something sort of positive, because a lot of founders watch the show.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.480]   It's like, look, what Jason said, you need to accept reality. And if you don't, you're going
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:43.440]   to have a bucket of very cold water dumped on your head when you go on fundraise and realize
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.720]   that you're not gonna be able to make it. And then all of a sudden, you're gonna be packing up
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.800]   shop very quickly. So you got to get
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:55.120]   a reality check and understand. But look, great companies are built during downturns.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.840]   You know, PayPal was built during the dot com crash. My company Yammer was built during the
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:00.960]   Great Recession.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.160]   Google, Uber.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.560]   Totally. I mean, the list goes on and on. So downturns are great times to build companies,
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.720]   because the war for talent subsides. So it's so much easier to recruit people. There's a lot
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.440]   fewer competitors getting funded. So there's way less noise in the ecosystem. The only thing that
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:20.000]   gets harder is fundraising. So you need to make sure that your money lasts, you do the right
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.200]   things, you focus on business fundamentals, you don't dequeue yourself. And if you do that,
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.600]   you'll be fine. You just brought up something incredible. I remember we raised money from
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:38.640]   Microsoft at a $15.3 billion valuation. The great financial crisis took hold and marked his credit,
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:44.720]   reset the valuation. We were already profitable. So we didn't necessarily need to raise that money.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.920]   But we I think we raised a billion dollars at like a $9 billion valuation. So we took a, you know, 30
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.000]   303 40% haircut, a down round, Facebook had a down round, we padded our balance sheet, and we said we
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.360]   are now going to go and crush and to your point, we were really able to compete much more effectively
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.560]   coming out of the GFC against Google for talent and against everybody else in that moment. Yeah.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:13.280]   And so if this is what people like Zuck are willing to do, you have to really hold people's
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:19.120]   feet to the fire for founders who are not him. What is the Fastdoc co founder willing to do?
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:24.160]   Shut it down like like literally the some founders, I find this very disturbing. But
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.920]   there are some founders who are so unwilling to make the cuts or take the medicine that they would
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.600]   rather run the fucking car into the wall than hit the brakes like hit the fucking brakes, save your
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:39.280]   company live to fight another day. If you have six months of runway, get to 12 and try to live.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.720]   Raise your prices. You're totally right. Every single company that hits the wall and goes
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.760]   out of business that didn't do a round of layoffs 12 months before was asleep at the wheel.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.880]   They were literally texting and driving. They were texting and driving.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.280]   Where was the round of layoffs a year before they ran out of money that at least
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.600]   gave them more runway? They didn't even do it. They just assumed they could go. David,
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.160]   if you think about it, your series your seed round was hard. Getting into Y Combinator was hard. Your
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.960]   series A, okay, it was it was hard. You had to do 25 meetings, but you got a term sheet. Your series
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:16.800]   B, you had five people offer your term sheets. Your series D, C and D were people begging you
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.680]   to take their money and saying name a price. So what does that mean?
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.720]   David Collum:
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.840]   That's what it means. You have to take the money and say, Hey, I'm going to do this.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.160]   I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. And then you have to take the money and say,
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.320]   Hey, I'm going to do this. And then you have to take the money and say, Hey, I'm going to do this.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.640]   And then you have to take the money and say, Hey, I'm going to do this. And then you have to take
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.800]   the money and say, Hey, I'm going to do this. And then you have to take the money and say, Hey,
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.600]   I'm going to do this. And then you have to take the money and say, Hey, I'm going to do this.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.640]   David Collum:
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.960]   And then you have to take the money and say, Hey, I'm going to do this. And then you have to take
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:44.160]   the same focus you had of selling people on buying shares in your company and put that into your
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.640]   product, the actual service and raise your prices. So many people are charging so little for their
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.480]   SaaS product or software. And they're like, I can't make this business work. And we say to them,
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.400]   if you doubled or tripled your price, would you lose? What percentage of customers would you lose?
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.200]   And they say, we'd lose like 10%. And I'm like, did you just, you have a million in revenue,
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.720]   2 million, 10% off 2 million. You've got 1.8. Would you rather make 800,000 more and be
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.880]   break even right now? And there are two months. Sometimes
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.560]   David Collum: Founders just have this amazing moment
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.440]   where like, Oh yeah, I guess we could charge more. And if we lost some customers, that wouldn't be
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.360]   the end of the world and we'd be profitable. David Collum:
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.720]   I think this speaks to the fact that, you know, it takes a very specific skill to be a very good
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.640]   founder. You need a level of intellectual curiosity. You need some, at some moments to
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.360]   listen, but at some moments to know just when to do what you feel is right. But it takes a lot of
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.360]   skill to be an investor. And I think we've glossed over how hard that business is as well, because
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.800]   the reality is if, if, if Michael Moritz were to tell you that you
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.040]   do it, you'd be hard pressed to not, to not say yes.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:41.440]   Of course.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.960]   If he really told you to do that, you would do it because, you know, these are,
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.680]   these are sort of the big, the big names in our industry. But the reality is the fact that it's
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.080]   not happening also speaks to the fact that there's probably, there shouldn't be a quarter trillion
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   dollars of funds that are probably stranded in the hands of really inexperienced allocators,
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.200]   who are going to light it on fire for the most part. And they're not going to have the courage
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.080]   to sort of lead these.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.720]   See what happens. All you need is
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:09.440]   all you need is one.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.480]   Everybody should think about what I don't know what, how you phrase it to founder sacks,
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.920]   but I say to them when I invest in their companies, listen, when, whenever things
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.520]   get really hard and you have a conversation, that is the hardest conversation. That's making
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.840]   the most nervous. That's making you stare at the ceiling and grind your teeth to your gums.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.240]   I want you to just call me and I can tell you like, I, you know, not speaking out of turn here,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.600]   but you know, Travis called me once or twice on a Saturday and said, Hey, we're struggling with X.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.640]   What do you think? And Travis knows how to run a business a thousand times better than me, but be
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.640]   a sounding board and giving your founders permission to come to you when things are
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.960]   fucked up is critically important as an investor and being able to have an intellectually honest
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.920]   to your point, Shemoth discussion about the hardest issues is really what the job is in my
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:57.520]   mind. What is going to send this company off the rails? What is the big fear you have? And let's
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.000]   just put it on the table and let's, as, as Travis would say, let's have a jam session. Let's jam on
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.720]   that until we solve the problem. So if you're suffering out there, you're scared. You know,
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.560]   it's gotta be an investor in your group who will have a
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:13.040]   candid discussion. If I had to give a punch list of things, if I was a founder right now,
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.440]   here, here are the things that I would do is I would sit down and really look at your growth
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.920]   and your burn and have an honest conversation with your co-founder or with one or two of your
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.800]   trusted board members and really say, what is the real valuation of this business today? And what
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.320]   could it actually be? And if there's a big gap between that and where you've last raised money,
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:38.480]   the right thing to do is to think about in one bucket, resetting the valuation in a second,
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.320]   bucket, making your employees whole and in a third bucket, managing your burn so that you extend your
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:50.240]   runway. I think if you could do those three things and take the hard medicine, now you will be much
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:57.120]   better off for it. You'll be appreciated by your employees and you'll have shown some real metal,
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.400]   in a real crucible moment to use a Sequoia phrase.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.840]   How do you guys think the market's going to settle out? Do you have any predictions on
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.400]   the bottom? I will tell you a statistic. I think Michael Burry put this out yesterday. He
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:14.640]   did not. He deletes his tweets every day. Very interesting character, by the way. But
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:24.800]   he pointed out how from top to bottom during the kind of '02 era, '01, you know, 2000 era,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.520]   and then during the 2009 era, you know, kind of those big drawdowns in the market.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:38.320]   He looked at companies like Microsoft, JP Morgan. I forgot which others but highlighted that, you know,
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.960]   the market was going to be tanking for quite a while. And these days that are big updates,
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.600]   everyone's trying to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.080]   And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.200]   the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know,
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.360]   I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.200]   you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.200]   And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.200]   the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:29:59.280]   to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know,
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:29:59.280]   I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like, you know, I'm going to call the bottom. And he's like,
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.040]   a few days and a few weeks now, which is like, you know, the dead cat bounce day,
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.200]   where the market's going to be tanking for quite a while. And these days that are big updates,
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.400]   everyone's trying to call the bottom. He's like, no, this is the dead cat bounce moment.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.080]   And he's like, if you look at kind of the structural rotation that's necessary
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.400]   for these markets to ultimately find their bottom, you know, we've got several multiple
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.120]   still to go with respect to volume that needs to trade before you find what the true market bottom
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:28.160]   is. So you know, it was a really interesting kind of insight to this kind of statistical insight
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:32.000]   that he pulled together and put on Twitter. I wanted to see if you guys kind of think that
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.760]   that might be the right way to think about it and how you react to, you know, these conversations
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.640]   around where's the bottom going to be? Can I just pull up this one chart,
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:44.000]   because it kind of speaks to this. So this is CPI inflation versus the Fed funds rate.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.760]   So if you look at this, it goes all the way back to 1954.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:54.000]   I shared it with you guys in the chat. The two have moved more or less in lockstep with each
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.320]   other, which makes sense because the Fed raises the Fed funds rate in order to combat inflation.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   So Fed funds and inflation sort of move in lockstep. If you look at what's happened over
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.360]   the past year, these two things have moved violently out of sync with each other. You have
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:15.040]   inflation now going all the way up to 8%. Meanwhile, the Fed funds rate is only down at like
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.120]   1%. Even with all the rate highs, you know, the Fed funds rate is down at like 1%. Meanwhile, the
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:17.520]   Fed funds rate is only down at like 1%. Meanwhile, the Fed funds rate is only down at like 1%. Even with all the rate highs,
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:17.520]   rates only down at like 1%. Meanwhile, the Fed funds rates only down at like 1%. Even with all the rate highs,
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:24.160]   and the talk of rate hikes that we've had, we're only at a 1%, you know, Fed funds rate.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:29.440]   Now, the expectation is, it's going to go higher, the 10-year T-bulls over 3%.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.160]   But the point is, the Fed is in a really tough spot here, because it feels like we're going
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.960]   into recession, which would normally mean you cut rates, but then you've got inflation
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:44.880]   demanding that we jack up rates far more. And I think this is the problem. And this
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.280]   is what's going to be very tough about our current situation is if we go into a recession,
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:52.320]   over the next six months, what does the Fed do about that? I mean, they don't really have much
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:58.000]   dry powder here. In previous recessions, like the GFC in '08, I mean, interest rates were around 5%.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.440]   So when they slashed them to zero, they had some serious, you know, that was some serious relief.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.720]   Here you're at 1%, what do you do? You drop that to zero. And then meanwhile,
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.800]   inflation still rampaging at 5%. This is what's so hard about it.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:17.040]   Then look at this other chart, which is, this came from a blog, a blog post called The Most Reckless
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:23.760]   Fed Ever. So in this most reckless Fed ever, they basically just took the Fed funds rate and
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:29.600]   subtracted inflation to get the real Fed funds rates, the Fed's funds rate, debt of inflation.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:36.240]   And what you could see here is that starting around 2018, '19, the real Fed funds rate
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.240]   started going negative and then very, very negative to the point now where it's basically
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:46.800]   a negative 7%. So, you know, why is that? Because the Fed waited way too long to basically
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:52.480]   take away the punch bowl and start reacting to inflation. You had Powell say a year ago
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.720]   that inflation was transitory and then they didn't react to it till the end of the year.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:01.520]   They should have stopped the QE right then and there, and then gradually started raising rates
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.560]   instead of these violent moves that we've had this year that are plunging the economy into recession
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.960]   that have caused the stock market crash. Now, what did Powell just say a week or two ago? He said
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:16.560]   he doesn't see a risk of recession on the horizon. It's like, what are you smoking? I mean, this is
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:20.960]   just like his inflation is transitory comment a year ago. You're wondering, like, do we have better
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:26.560]   data than the Fed chair does? Because from where we're sitting, we're seeing a stock market crash,
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.000]   a panic and a recession, and he doesn't even see it. It's like...
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.040]   Denial is not just a river in Egypt. This is crazy.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.120]   Look, I mean, we call it a crash, but, you know, some people might just say that
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:42.320]   investors are violently reacting to the shifting tides on capital availability.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   But I will tell you, I'll say this one more time, because I think it's so important
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.800]   and it's my kind of prediction of the week. I really think we're going to run into a consumer
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.960]   credit bubble here. I do not think that consumers are going to slow down their spending or change
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.840]   their lifestyle as quickly as investors are changing their investing style. We have seen
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:08.400]   investors in public markets and private markets take massive corrective hits this week and last
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.080]   week, and they're changing their behavior and some of the stories we shared today.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.080]   But consumers are taking on more credit. They're opening credit cards. They're taking out bigger
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.520]   loans. Prices are going up 10% year over year for them. And so the concern is if we actually do hit
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.480]   a recession and we don't see real wage growth and the consumer credit bubble continues to grow,
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.080]   we're going to face a credit crisis in call it nine to, you know, nine months to a year,
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.200]   where we're all going to wake up and be like, wait a second, how are consumers going to be
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.880]   able to afford all this credit? Very simple.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.040]   And I don't know how you bridge that hole. End of the great resignation. That whole concept
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.840]   of like fun employed and I'm going to flip NFTs and I'm not going to go to work. That's out the
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.760]   window. So people who've been enjoying it, people are going to need jobs.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:53.600]   That there are, there are more shoes to drop here. And I think consumer is one of them.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.120]   And maybe there's systemic risks in the system that haven't been flushed out yet.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.600]   And meanwhile, you've got a fed chair in denial about what's happening and you've got a president
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.000]   of the United States. Sue's more focused on what's happening in Ukraine than what's happening in the
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.520]   United States. We are let we have Tweedle Dee and Tweedle dumb on this case. Biden and Powell are
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.600]   going to go down as the worst president and fed chair of all time.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.560]   No, it is. It is like the anti Reagan Volcker combination. I mean, they've caused this problem.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.960]   First of all, this is a long, I don't know if I agree. It's a longer conversation. I got to run,
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.360]   but yeah, like, you know, I think we all spent a little bit of money too. We all want to blame
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.000]   someone. The reality is there was a massive leveraging that happened going into 2008.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.920]   And we got to work it out. We thought we were delivering and I don't think we've been delivering
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.880]   since 2008. And all of a sudden the chickens coming home to roost or whatever the term is.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.880]   And we're all sort of waking up to the fact that wait a second.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.960]   The system with 10 trillion. We got to work. That's the cause. It's not. And more recently,
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.280]   consumers and all of us have gotten years ago. It's not for 14 years ago.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:02.080]   Three years austerity measures in the long cycle here. But go, if you look back through time,
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.040]   roughly, if you look at like the average mean P for the S&P 500, it can go down to as low as 3000.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.480]   It could. But I think the reality is there's a Fed put somewhere in between here because,
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:15.120]   you know, if we see the credit markets
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.520]   really seize up, which we would if the equity markets continue to retrench,
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.840]   the Fed will be forced to step in with liquidity and we back to where we were before. So,
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:32.160]   you know, I actually think we're probably close to a near bottom ish here 3800 ish in the S&P 500.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.680]   You're actually starting to see some of these early green shoots of a market bottom. What are
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:44.080]   those? It's when the most heavily shorted stocks start to rip up, you know, sort of the gain stop
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:49.600]   like rallies and you're seeing that actually today. So it's a it's a really interesting day
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.680]   when the market is roughly flat, slightly down. But some of these companies, you know,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.680]   Well, block percent, square five, 6%
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.480]   are mad as a 25% even lift went up 5%. So this is the bad.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.080]   There was definitely some panic selling yesterday.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.360]   I think it's bouncing along the bottom. Yeah.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.320]   There was so much panic selling yesterday that the market's bouncing up from that.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:14.640]   Look, the market is a leading indicator, not a lagging indicator. And so it's it adjusts first.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.800]   And then the real economy adjusts after that. And the risk right now is the stock market is
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.680]   telling us something about where the real economy is headed. And the problem is that the Fed and the
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.440]   central government don't really have the tools to fight the recession because interest rates
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.320]   are already so low. And, you know, Biden already spent all the money. I mean, they broke the glass
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:37.360]   in case of emergency last year. They spent that last $2 trillion of emergency relief.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.680]   Look, Larry Summers told him they didn't need to do it. Remember that?
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.400]   Larry Summers told him it would lead to inflation. Nobody I know,
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.200]   I know no one wants to listen to Larry Summers. He's like one of those guys.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.560]   You never want to. It's correct. But Larry Summers was correct. The administration did not listen to
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.480]   him. Larry, who I know very well, and a wife who I love is like girly as well. He's generally right
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.840]   in the end. And so I would just kind of Yeah, you know, he was right.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:06.960]   I mean, we do need to get back to the Clinton, you know, moderate, like balance the budget,
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.040]   stop spending some austerity measures. Like we can only work our way out of this. And
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.160]   I think what we're going to learn from this is the concept of free money
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.720]   and printing money is not sustainable. And the concept of Americans not going to work
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:24.240]   is not going to make the economy that Americans want to live in. I know this sounds fucking crazy.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:30.640]   But if you want to spend money and you want to enjoy life, you got to work you can't, we can't
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.280]   have this kind of labor participation. And we can't have people flipping NF T's for a living.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.040]   That's not work. You're right, Jason, you're right about that.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.920]   I saw this thing where there's a there's a new product implementation on Airbnb,
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.960]   that allows you to kind of like, you know, search by campgrounds or search by castles or
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:58.400]   by vibe, it's vibe search. And, and it's a perfect encapsulation of this moment where there are folks
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.520]   who have all of this flexibility they've never enjoyed before, that their mindset, you know,
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.400]   especially if you're like a social striver, like you can signal that you're different from everybody
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.680]   else by lifestyle. But that works in a in a world where there's lots of free money. And when that
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:18.400]   free money gets taken away, I'm not sure that you're renting castles to spend a week here in
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.280]   a week there. Well, I mean, we all want to talk about UBI, I think it's a very virtual signaling
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.360]   thing to do. And it's a very like world positive thing to do all there's gonna be so much money
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.200]   that we can just drop it from the heavens. And everybody's gonna get a private jet,
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.520]   everybody's gonna get to flip their NF T's. And your board apes going to become worth a million
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.520]   dollars, your Bitcoin is going to be a million dollars each. This is not reality, folks. Value
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.880]   is created when you make stuff in the world when you write code when you build companies when you
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:43.440]   go to work.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.520]   But it's gonna take a long time.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.000]   I mean, at some point, maybe we'll have some energy source and you know, robots building
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.720]   everything for us. But we got to wrap here. We'll see everybody at the all in summit. There'll be a
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:58.400]   bunch of stuff dropping do just a couple of programming notes. Please, please, please,
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.920]   there are no more tickets up. Do not try and crash the party. There's gonna be security there.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:05.840]   Everybody with a badge. We're going to be checking the badges to moth. Everybody's got a photo on
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:10.400]   their badge. Please don't bring a plus one. And please, please, please, please do not try to crash.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.200]   Thank you. Love you. Love you. Talk to you soon, everybody. We'll see you next
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.200]   time on the all in podcast. Bye bye.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.080]   Let your winners ride.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.960]   Rain Man David Sacks.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:27.760]   And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.400]   Love you.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.760]   I'm going all in.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:38.000]   Besties are gone.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.960]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.200]   Oh, man. My avatars will meet me at.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:51.120]   You should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.160]   It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:41:02.000]   What you're the beat. What your beat. What your beat. We need to get merch.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:12.000]   I'm doing all in. I'm doing all in.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   .
