[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   So I want you to remember, because you guys are the people
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.800]   building this stuff, that the stakes are really high.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.280]   It's really important to reason from first principles
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   and just do whatever you possibly can to proceed wisely.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.720]   Weave is a powerful compositional toolkit
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840]   for ML practitioners.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840]   This is a new kind of truly programmable UI,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.920]   and we're only just starting to figure out ourselves
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.000]   what this powerful tool can do.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.040]   You can log production data to weights and biases
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.500]   with a few lines of code and get beautiful Weave dashboards
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.840]   that you can customize to your use case.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.720]   So I'm very proud to announce that, as of today,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.720]   Weave is free and open source.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   It's not restrained the way human brains are restrained.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840]   We could have the most incredible future
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.280]   if we get this right.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   We focused on the details from the inside
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.360]   out to enable the next generation of ML apps
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.200]   and tooling.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.460]   The system is incredibly powerful and fun,
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.600]   and I couldn't be more excited to put it in your hands.
