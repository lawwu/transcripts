[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.800]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.160]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.880]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   My name is Joshua.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   I am your host.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   I am your guide.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.120]   I am your advisor.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.760]   I am your fellow journeyer on this pathway of financial freedom.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:24.640]   And today, as we do any day that I can arrange the technology, we have live Q&A.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.040]   As we begin this show, we've got three callers waiting on the line and I've got two written
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.320]   in questions from patrons of the show.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.680]   So we're going to be doing with those.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.320]   Before I begin the live calls, just one quick thing, a little bit different.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.840]   I would love to get your feedback on a few things.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.440]   I've got a lot of big plans for the next months.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.120]   I feel like I'm always saying I've got a lot of big plans, but I do have a lot of big plans
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.800]   and I'm making progress on many things.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.440]   You know, the constant travel and new children and what has been really challenging for the
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.920]   last year and a half.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720]   But I am making really good progress and expanding the business and doing a lot.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600]   So I've got a lot of things that I'm going to be announcing to you.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.560]   I'm working on the infrastructure for a new membership site, which will be launching in
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.520]   January, which will help me to fulfill the mission that I lead every show with.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.960]   You've noticed that the podcasts have been more consistent every Monday, Wednesday, and
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.160]   Friday is the current podcasting schedule.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.980]   I've been reengaging with social media.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.800]   So if you haven't been there, come on by Facebook and it's facebook.com/groups/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.160]   Join our Radical Personal Finance Facebook group.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.880]   I was out of that group for about a year and a half, but I am back now interacting there.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.360]   Also make sure to like the page at radicalpersonalfinance.com, whatever the page is.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   Search for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   You'll find me on Facebook.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.440]   I'm doing a lot more video there on Facebook as well.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.600]   Find me on Twitter, doing a lot more work on Twitter, twitter.com/joshuasheats.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   If you want to just get quick interaction with me, see some of the things that I'm thinking
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.720]   about, you can do that on Twitter.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.160]   But those are all preamble to simply this.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.960]   I would like to host a live event at some point and I'll either do it this coming spring
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.880]   or January, February, kind of the new year, or possibly wait till next year.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.960]   But what I'm working on is one of the things that I really believe is the future for most
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.640]   of us in most of what we're doing is to bring together a better mix of the online world
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.360]   and the offline world.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.300]   I think that is the ideal.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.160]   As so much of our lives have gone digital, we've gained a lot of really great benefits
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760]   and advantages from that work.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.520]   For example, I'm speaking to you right now, right on your phone, right on your computer.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   And that's great.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.640]   It allows us to have a relationship that previously was not possible.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.600]   I have listeners, tens of thousands of listeners all around the world, which is such a blessing.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.800]   I'm doing this call-in show and there's people, looks like all the numbers on my screen right
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.000]   now are US-American numbers, but you can call into this show from no matter where you are.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.600]   So it brings us tremendous opportunities.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.280]   But what's hard is to keep the same strength of interpersonal relationships when all the
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.960]   communication is digital.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.200]   And I've noticed this over the years as I've gone to conferences and I've interacted with
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   more and more people who are remote virtual workers, is I've come to be really convinced
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.880]   that the best thing is to do a lot of interaction digitally, but there has to be in-person interaction.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.040]   And I think so many people gain from that.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.120]   I've just gotten back from FinCon in Washington, DC a couple of weeks ago.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.440]   And the FinCon community is financial bloggers and people like me, podcasters and YouTube
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.640]   people and financial advisors who love to come together.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.800]   And those relationships are so strengthened there in person.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.420]   And one of the things I've done, I've done a couple of big public meetups in Toronto
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.760]   and in Washington, DC in the last few weeks.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.680]   And I had such a great turnout for those.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.600]   I so thoroughly enjoyed meeting the listeners, talking, hearing the great stories, et cetera.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.120]   And so what I'd like to do is I'd like to, or I'm thinking about doing, let me say, I
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.920]   would like to, yes, and I'm thinking about it.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.680]   I'm thinking about organizing an event of my own.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.760]   And what I'm imagining doing is I think that the best way for me to serve people who are
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.120]   just getting started is through this type of digital content, through the free podcast,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.560]   through the new membership site that I'll be launching in January, which will have everything
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.960]   organized in a way that this podcast has never been able to accomplish, of all the things
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.200]   that you need to do to actually accomplish reaching that goal of financial freedom in
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.960]   10 years or less.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.040]   But I'd still like to do something in person.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.480]   I'd like to arrange some kind of in-person event.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.360]   Now I've got a number of different ideas of some ways that I'd like to do it.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.000]   I could just do it as meetups, right?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.080]   That's always an opportunity.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.600]   And we had a lot of people come out to the meetups, but the problem with a meetup is,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   you know, the last one I showed up in Washington, DC and now it's my own fault.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   I was late to the meetup because I got detained at the airport and detained with the airlines
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.520]   and detained with customs.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.200]   Anyway, so I was late, but still there were probably, I would say, 40 people there at
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.600]   the meetup and I had, you know, 10 minutes max with each person.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.720]   So I'd like to do something that's multi-day and I can structure it as, so I'm thinking
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.840]   about something like a three-day event.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.920]   And then what I'd like to do is I can structure it in the form of lectures, possibly, or doing
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.140]   all the lecturing myself on a number of topics in kind of an organized way.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.800]   We can go into some topics that I don't cover on the show very much.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.760]   That would depend, for example, on the financial profile of the attendees.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.400]   I try to keep the show largely at kind of entry level to intermediate content, but we
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.440]   could go deep into some advanced stuff in an in-person seminar.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.800]   I could also bring other lecturers.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.480]   There are other people in this space or other professional people that I could bring together.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.720]   And most importantly, I'd love to just spend several days with you and then arrange an
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.280]   opportunity for you to meet some other listeners and to spend several days with those other
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.440]   listeners.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.880]   And so my vision right now is something like a three-day event at a location that would
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.440]   arrange where you just simply go there and it's a perfect location to simply be together.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.920]   Now right now I could do it in the United States, but I think it's more interesting
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.640]   to do things outside of the United States and I don't love spending a ton of time in
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.280]   the United States myself.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.560]   If you guys really, really want something in the United States, I'm willing to do that
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.760]   because I'm going to go wherever you are and serve you however I can.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.040]   But also at the moment I've thought about doing something either in Colombia, Costa
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.360]   Rica, Mexico, or Nicaragua.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.880]   And there are advantages and disadvantages to each of those.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.640]   Colombia, I've thought about trying to figure out if there's some way that I could host
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.240]   an event in one of the border cities where we could do some work and help in some of
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.920]   the refugee camps with the Venezuelan refugees.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's really hard for me to figure out the solution right now, but that's the reason
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.440]   why I like the idea of having something in Colombia.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.840]   Colombia is just a wonderful country.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.200]   It's absolutely on the upswing.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.600]   There are tremendous opportunities left and right in Colombia right now.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.680]   So if you've never been to Colombia, it's a really good time to go.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.960]   I love Colombia.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   Costa Rica is a really good option.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.880]   People like to go to Costa Rica.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.280]   Costa Rica has the benefit of being really easy to get to.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   It's cheap to get to from all over the United States.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.240]   It has tremendous tourist infrastructure, so we can do a really good integration of
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.760]   fun stuff and great tourist stuff.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.440]   Anyway, Costa Rica has a lot to go for.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.040]   Mexico I think has a lot of good things to go for.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.080]   There are lots of resorts and things in Mexico.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.160]   It's cheap to fly to.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.840]   It's easy to get into.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.720]   Some people may drive to that if you're in the southern United States.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.920]   That can be helpful.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.960]   And then there's opportunities in Nicaragua.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.200]   If I do it in Nicaragua, what I would do is I would do it at Mark Ford at his resort that
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.720]   he developed with some of his friends.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.640]   They're on the Pacific Coast in Nicaragua, which is a wonderful place.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.240]   Frankly, it's the perfect place.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.040]   It's probably my number one spot right now.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.760]   It's got tremendous places to stay.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.360]   It's got a perfect conference room that can handle up to 60 people or so, which I'd like
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.300]   to keep the total number of people 50 to 60, something like that.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.400]   It's all inclusive.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Everything is there.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   It's really high end.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   And it's in Nicaragua.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.440]   And Nicaragua is an interesting place because Nicaragua is really having a lot of challenges
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.000]   over the last year and a half.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.680]   A bunch of people, I'll just skip those challenges.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.000]   If you don't know about them, you can research them, but had a lot of challenges, but it's
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.760]   totally fine for the kind of thing that I'm talking about.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.440]   And it's also a lot of opportunities.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.600]   It's behind Costa Rica in terms of development.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.160]   But there are a lot of opportunities in a place like Nicaragua.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.760]   So anyway, those are kind of my four options.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.940]   And I think that it would be fun for those of you who are in the snowy north, we do something
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.680]   in probably February.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.040]   It would be a good option to do that.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.240]   So here's what I would like.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   That's just what I'm thinking about.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.560]   I haven't booked any place.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.880]   I haven't made any commitments.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.080]   I've worked through some basic budgets.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:30.320]   What I'm guessing at right now is to, what I'm guessing at is a fee, a tuition, not tuition,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.360]   charge, cost, whatever, of something like $3,000 for the, and that would include everything,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.640]   include lodging, include activities, include food, basically just show up in a certain
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.140]   city and everything is taken care of from there.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.520]   So I'd like to keep it a high end event.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.120]   And so that's basically what I'm thinking.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.560]   So here's what I would like to know from you.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.920]   Is that the kind of thing that you'd be interested in?
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.160]   If so, email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.360]   Send me an email, let me know your thoughts and see if that might be something that you
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.880]   would enjoy.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.800]   Multiple benefits, again, the lecturing, the fun, you could bring your family and get out
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.280]   of the wintry north.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.160]   You can arrange this so it can be part of your business expenses is always a good idea.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.140]   And then the interaction with other people who are in a similar, who are part of the
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.500]   radical personal finance community.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.300]   I have just so enjoyed the meetups and things that I've done recently, and I'd like to do
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.300]   more of that.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.260]   So I'm not 100% sure whether it'll be early 2020 or whether we'll pick that up in early
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.420]   2021.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.100]   That would depend on the response.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.820]   So if that interests you, send me an email and let me know.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.820]   Let's go first to the phones.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.820]   We go to Anne in Maryland.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.820]   Anne, welcome to the show.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.820]   How can I serve you today?
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.820]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.980]   Thank you so much for taking my call.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:55.620]   I have a question about healthcare and getting healthcare.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.980]   And I am conflicted because I am concerned about the healthcare in the United States
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.980]   and for two major reasons.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.220]   So first of all, of course, financial toxicity that it can bring unexpectedly.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.780]   And then also I personally do not, cannot tell the quality of care.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:23.340]   And I don't know how to tell the quality of care because it's so kind of a black box sometimes.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.860]   And so I was thinking, what can I do to make the best decision?
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.820]   And I wanted to hear your practical advice.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.860]   And just to give you kind of dimensions across which I'm thinking.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.740]   So first one is the quality of care and safety.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:48.420]   I was thinking there are reviews online, but I don't particularly trust patients' reviews
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.740]   because I don't believe they know what they're talking about.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:57.380]   What I would ideally want to see is a survey of, let's say, nurses who work at the institution
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:04.660]   and ask them, would you want to have your own healthcare problem solved in that institution
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.740]   or not?
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.940]   But this information is obviously not available.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:16.020]   Then things like I would want to know if that, which institutions are notorious for suing
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.380]   patients, which I consider in the majority of cases immoral.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.660]   And so I would want to know how toxic that is.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.460]   And of course, I want to know the prices.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.580]   Like everyone wants to know whether they're competitive, where they're going to be transparent.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.780]   If I pay cash, can I do it?
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.540]   Will they, will that be enticing?
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:44.060]   So those different aspects that I'm thinking about, and I want to know if you've ever wrestled
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:50.780]   with any of this and what solutions you found for yourself and for your friends and for
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.780]   your family.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.940]   Are you currently facing some kind of ongoing chronic medical condition that you're concerned
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.940]   about?
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.660]   Or is this a hypothetical, if in the future I need more healthcare?
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.820]   What would be the best way to do it?
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.620]   It's hypothetical and I'm thinking it's exactly the time when I need to do this because I'm
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.460]   imagining if any emergency strikes, I will have to just to take what comes my way.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.260]   And now I feel I'm wasting my time if I'm not using this time when I'm not facing anything
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.260]   like this.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.420]   Do you have health insurance now?
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.780]   Yes, I do.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.260]   So you're not concerned about the financial components of healthcare.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.580]   You're more thinking about how can I get quality care, is that right?
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:48.820]   That's true, but I actually personally want to get quality of care for the, with the right
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   price.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:55.060]   So let's say, yes, I do have insurance and it's quite comprehensive, but I don't believe
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:04.180]   it's morally right to go and do a procedure or go to a healthcare institution which charges
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:11.100]   huge prices to my insurance because that trickles back to everyone else's premiums and I just
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.780]   want to be a contributor to that toxic system.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:20.100]   So even though I am okay, but I want to do the right thing.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.420]   Okay, I understand.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:28.100]   Well here would be, so I, so you asked a lot of good questions about how to get reviews
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.300]   on physicians and things like that.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.420]   I'm not competent to answer that.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.340]   I would assume that some people out there are trying to work on a system like that.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.740]   If not, maybe there's a way that you or any, some other listener can develop a system where
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:49.220]   somehow you screen the opinions of people on certain medical providers and try to figure
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.100]   out how to get the nurses to leave the reviews.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.060]   But I have no information on that, so I'm not competent to answer that question.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:02.380]   I'm also not competent to judge the quality of care in any kind of way outside of personal
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.060]   subjective experience.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:10.500]   I think one thing that we can and should do is to just simply recognize how each of us
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.660]   feels, how each of us feels about the quality of care.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.460]   I think we still have, and especially if we continue to hone our abilities, we still have
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.300]   the ability to recognize when we're getting treated well and when we're not getting treated
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.300]   well.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:29.740]   And I'm a big fan of the fact that now there are so many groups and public resources available
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.500]   for people who are experiencing certain medical conditions because those groups and online
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.380]   resources, et cetera, allow people to check out their doctor's opinions.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.580]   And I know some doctors don't like that.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.860]   Many doctors don't like that because there's been a loss of respect.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.620]   But I personally think it's a good thing, and I come from a world of being a financial
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   advisor.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.940]   And financial advisors, probably many of us would have liked to go back to the world where
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.500]   there weren't so many online resources and reviews and everything.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.100]   But the reality is it's good.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.140]   It's good for us to be held to account.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.500]   It's good for us to face that market competition.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.500]   And so I'm happy for it.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.840]   I like the market.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.180]   So I would say the first thing is probably the only practical thing I could offer would
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.460]   be to make sure that you become the best student of whatever health condition that you have.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:21.220]   I have observed so many people, and I've observed that there seem to be kind of two different
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.440]   kinds of people.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.940]   People who just simply take what they're told and then don't fight, or other people who
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.500]   say I'm going to become the expert at this certain thing.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.900]   And there's the old joke that what do you do if your doctor comes to you and tells you
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.620]   that your disease is incurable?
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.060]   You fire him and go find another doctor.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.500]   So you find somebody who will tell you, yeah, here's what you can try.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.340]   And I think what I see serving that is all the support groups for different kinds of
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.980]   illnesses, different kinds of conditions, and then the dissemination of information
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.820]   through YouTube, through Facebook, through blogs, et cetera.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.860]   Now obviously we have problems because most of us don't have the expertise in a certain
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.100]   issue to know what's true and what's not.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.940]   And that's really challenging.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.980]   But it's better than just everything being hidden behind a wall.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.380]   Financially, to your specific question about insurance, I don't know that there's a great
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.020]   answer to it.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.980]   Because the prices that you are paying are the prices the insurance company is going
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.020]   to pay.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.460]   And it's not necessarily your responsibility to adjust those prices.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.460]   It's the insurance company's responsibility to negotiate those prices.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:33.060]   The medical system in the United States is broken, and probably irreparably broken.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:39.060]   I don't know of—I had some optimism a number of years ago when high deductible health insurance
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.500]   policies first came out and were being promoted.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.300]   And I thought, well, maybe this could help.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   Maybe this would help individuals to start negotiating with doctors.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.140]   But I haven't seen any evidence presented to me that shows how somehow that's made a
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.820]   big difference.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.420]   You have a major political conflict right now.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:04.700]   You have the failure of the Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.940]   You have a major press by the Democrats to move past the Affordable Care Act to move
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.740]   into a single-payer health care system of some kind.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.700]   In many ways—I was talking with a friend of mine—in many ways that kind of thing
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.200]   seems almost inevitable.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.060]   Because very few people are happy with the way things are right now.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.540]   And I don't know the solution.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.260]   I don't have the solution for that.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260]   So I don't know that it's necessarily your responsibility to do that.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.300]   But if you do want to do it, here are a few things you can do.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:36.760]   Number one, if you simply adjust your insurance policy to have a very high deductible, then
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.340]   you would be the one to benefit from your cost shopping, from your negotiations, from
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.180]   paying cash, etc.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.540]   Because then you're just simply saving the insurance company money, and you're actually
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.260]   saving yourself money because you have the high deductible, and you're wanting to make
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.940]   sure that you don't trigger that deductible.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.140]   So that would be the first thing.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.700]   The best thing is, if you wanted to or if it were appropriate, to move to one of the
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.340]   health care sharing organizations.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.220]   Now, I wouldn't go there unless you had other reasons to do it, but that is one of the benefits
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.980]   of the health care sharing organizations.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.420]   I always feel like I'm with my team, I'm with my people, and so when I negotiate a discount
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.260]   or if I get something cheaper, then I have that option.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.740]   I'm benefiting all of us, and I'm keeping all of our rates down.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.020]   That's one thing I like about using Samaritan Ministries, which is what I use with the health
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.100]   care sharing operations.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.260]   Beyond that, how do you get prices?
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.900]   Well, I think there are some...
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.620]   How do you get prices made in advance?
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.980]   I think there are some good market solutions that are starting to come out.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.500]   Walmart recently launched Walmart Health, and they're launching this at some of their
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.380]   big super centers, where you go into Walmart Health and you can get clearly priced vision
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.180]   care, clearly priced medical care, nutrition, weight loss consulting, etc.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.660]   And all the pricing is up front, it's all flat pricing.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.100]   I think that's really good.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.820]   The urgent care marketplace has really made a major impact.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:02.180]   Most people, I myself am included in this, but most people would just choose, rather
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.460]   than going to the emergency room where they don't know if they're going to be there for
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.260]   eight hours and walk out the door with a $20,000 bill, they go to an urgent care facility and
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:14.780]   get care there where prices are much more reasonable and discounted in advance.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.900]   There is a growing...
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.580]   I don't know that it's having a big impact yet, but there's a growing movement for concierge
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.660]   medicine where you just simply have your doctor and you pay a fee and they don't take insurance,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.700]   it's just simply done with cash.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.180]   Those things don't really help you because you do have insurance.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.020]   So my answer is I probably wouldn't worry about it since you do have insurance.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.980]   If you were thinking about dropping insurance, then some of these other things come into
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.860]   play.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.180]   You could also investigate medical tourism.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.740]   I think that's one of the growth areas that'll be in the future.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:53.660]   There's a listener of the show, he blogs at a blog called Be Unconstrained, but he just
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.700]   shared the story of how he went to Mexico for major shoulder surgery and had a great
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   result.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.260]   I can't remember the exact numbers, but he was quoted tens of thousands of dollars for
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.700]   his shoulder surgery in the United States, but he got it done in Guadalajara for something
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.580]   like six or eight thousand dollars.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.660]   I think many of those options are there, are going to grow in the future.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.020]   So I can't necessarily solve the ethical problem.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.580]   I would say it's probably not necessarily your responsibility to worry about saving
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.900]   the insurance company money.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.860]   That's their responsibility and I appreciate the sentiment.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.580]   I think that's very noble of you, but I would just focus on making sure that you are getting
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.900]   the care that you need and that your finances are adjusted so that care that you get isn't
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.900]   going to bankrupt you.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.020]   These are great ideas.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:51.140]   I actually don't know about Walmart and I kind of never paid attention to urgent care
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.380]   facilities and whether they're different from other things.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.500]   So I'm just going to Google those things around me.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.020]   I have a question.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:09.460]   Whether you ever paid cash up front or right after an appointment for any medical non-dental
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.140]   work and how did it work for you?
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.140]   If you ever done it.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.140]   I've had minimal interaction with the medical system and part of that is by design.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.940]   I'm scared of doctors and hospitals because people die in hospitals.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:32.300]   One of the major leading causes of death in the United States after a few of the big ones
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.980]   like cancer and heart disease.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.780]   I think it's number four or something is medical errors.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.500]   So I think being in a hospital is an extremely dangerous place to be.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:48.580]   And so if I actually have an acute life-threatening disease, I've actually been in a car accident
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:54.860]   and my pelvis is broken in 27 places, then I want to be in a hospital.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:02.100]   I think the US medical system is fantastic at that dire surgical intervention to save
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.860]   people's lives.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.060]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.100]   But in terms of, but I've personally never been in a situation, whether that's by any
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.420]   influence of mine or just simply the circumstances that they've been ordained for me.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.420]   I don't know.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.420]   I always try to be careful.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.500]   I try to think ahead.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.020]   I try to make sure that I drive safely and I wear protective gear at all times and things
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.660]   like that to minimize any risks of having personal injury.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.260]   But I've always been, I've been fortunate and blessed never to need acute care.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:39.620]   I have a very low opinion of the US medical system's ability to actually make people healthy.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:44.320]   It seems as though we are not good at helping people be healthy.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.900]   We have a population that is sicker than ever, is fatter than ever, and is dumber than ever.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.180]   And I don't know why that is.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.900]   I have opinions, but I don't know why it is, but I don't have much confidence in talking
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:00.420]   to most physicians, unless there's a physician who's really tackled that subject head on.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.580]   So I personally try to minimize interaction with the medical system.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:11.340]   That said, I'm acknowledging that all of that was just simply to say that I'm not an expert
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.500]   in this.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.020]   I try to minimize my exposure for the reasons stated.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.780]   But that said, I've always paid cash for everything.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.540]   I've never had a $500,000 hospital bill, which of course would be handled through the normal
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.740]   circumstances.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.020]   But when I go and get something, I pay cash.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.600]   And especially as I've tried to, I pay cash.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600]   That's very simple.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   And it's not hard to do.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.900]   You just pull out money and you pay them.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.680]   And then you use the fact that you're standing there with money in your hand to negotiate
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.900]   a discount.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:48.060]   And usually if you'll do things in advance and you'll negotiate it in advance, you'll
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.120]   get discounts in and of itself.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.020]   So to me it's easy.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.380]   I don't have anything to add.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.380]   It's simple to do.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.820]   Use the power of cash.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.200]   Ask the price in advance.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.380]   One of the best things that you can always do is just simply be the person who asks for
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.220]   prices in advance.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.380]   Very few patients do that.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.220]   And so as a result, you're often surprised.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.460]   But you would be surprised if you just simply ask people, "How much is this going to cost?
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.740]   Is this really necessary?"
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.740]   Then go from there.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.740]   So that's my answer.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   Anything else, Anne?
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.740]   I've got a bunch of callers.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.740]   I'll move on unless you've got another final question.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.740]   Thank you very much.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.740]   My pleasure.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.740]   Thank you for calling in.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.740]   We go now to Nam in New Jersey.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.740]   Nam, welcome to the show.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.740]   How can I serve you today?
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.740]   Hi.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.740]   Good afternoon, Joshua.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:36.700]   I'm glad that you're back on social media.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.820]   I've recently seen that you put up some new content on Facebook.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:47.620]   Nam, I'm sacrificing all my principles for you because I care about you.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.780]   So I'm glad that you're appreciating it.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.780]   Go ahead.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   Thank you.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.780]   Thank you.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.780]   All right.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:06.540]   So I've been fortunate, just came with the news that I am exempt from a property tax.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:13.940]   And throughout some research that the real estate tax, I'll be exempt on my property
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.580]   if I were to live in Pennsylvania or New Jersey.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:25.940]   Currently me and my wife, we own our first home for about a year now in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:34.660]   And with this news coming in, now that we will be exempt as of next year, we were thinking
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:40.460]   of moving to also to New Jersey.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:45.700]   Now one episode I've listened to you that you stressed about also was about state income
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.700]   tax.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:55.780]   Moving to New Jersey, there will be about a 2.2% increase in state income tax because
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:09.540]   at of earning as a household, we fell at about 5.2% state income tax where in Pennsylvania
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:19.700]   currently we are only doing, we only pay 3.07 where they only have a flat fixed rate
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.260]   on state income tax.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:34.260]   So besides running the numbers, and we are planning to have a first born within the next
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:44.020]   two years, I just want some sort of school of thoughts or guidance besides me just running
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:51.580]   the state income numbers because that's probably something else I'm not taking into
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.580]   consideration.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:28:00.420]   I try to run the numbers just to see if it makes sense or not for us to relocate to New
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.420]   Jersey.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.820]   Tell me about other considerations such as your work, can you live equally and earn the
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.260]   same in both locations?
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:17.780]   Yes, commute wise it would still be about the same expense.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:24.980]   Moving to New Jersey it will increase, besides the state income tax of course, but with commute
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:32.020]   there will be another $2,000 increase due to the tolls that we have.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.940]   Why is it that you would be exempt from property tax living in New Jersey?
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:45.820]   As a veteran, I just got this news that I'll be exempt from, and there's only a few
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:53.020]   taxes, I mean a few states, not every state, you know, are doing this.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:59.580]   However in Pennsylvania there are income limits where New Jersey there is not.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.860]   And you're over the income limits in Pennsylvania?
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   In three years, yes, due to promotions, locality, maybe go to state law will change, it will
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:22.340]   adjust based on the cost of living, but at the rate that I'm going and I'm earning,
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:29.580]   we're both still somewhat a junior level in our career.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:38.940]   We're seeing about 25 more years of employment in our lifetime, we're only in our late 20s.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.980]   You mentioned that you and your wife are hoping to have a baby in the next two years, would
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.740]   she have any inclination towards staying home with the baby, and would that drop your income
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.740]   in two years?
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:30:00.660]   Yes, she did talk that she will like to take some time off to take care of that.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:11.540]   As far as child care goes, the only close relative that we have would be her father
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:21.500]   who's no longer working, and he's already taking Social Security, and he's not doing
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.500]   it, so mostly he will be helping with child care.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:34.220]   But yes, she did say she would like to take off at least half a year to help to take care
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.220]   of the baby.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:41.140]   So you can consider that, if your income is below Pennsylvania numbers right now, but
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.180]   in two years you might have a baby and then her income would go down, then that might
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.020]   be something that would factor into your planning.
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.340]   So you're obviously a detail-oriented person with regard to the finances.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.860]   You've calculated an additional $2,000 worth of tolls.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.900]   So let's talk first about the, we'll talk first about things that are more important
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.180]   in my opinion than finances, and then we'll come back to finances.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.860]   Recognize that in general, finances are not the key driving factor that's going to affect
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.380]   your lifestyle or your happiness in any one location.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.340]   Usually it's going to be things like your family and your friends.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.740]   Now you said, sounds like minimal family interaction, but that for most of us is the single driving
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.380]   factor that makes a difference in our quality of life.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.540]   Are we close to the people that we love?
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.260]   Are we close to the people that we enjoy spending time with?
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:33.420]   Are we in a compatible culture, some place that's culturally comfortable for us?
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.740]   Now if we assume that your situation is the same either way, that New Jersey or Pennsylvania
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.300]   both have the same exposure to family and friends, then we can move on.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.460]   The second big thing to consider would be career and career opportunities.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.580]   Now it sounds like you're going to be working the same job either way.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.620]   It's just you come in from the east or from the west.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.100]   Well that's up to you.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.220]   But if there's a difference in terms of your networking opportunities, for example, if
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.100]   you live, I don't know this to be the fact, but let's just make it up.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.900]   Let's say if you live in the boonies of Pennsylvania and then you just go to the same job, but
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.180]   that doesn't give you the opportunity to go down and be part of the local Rotary Club
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.940]   or to be part of the Toastmasters group or to be part of the networking organization
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.360]   for your industry.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.220]   But if you moved to New Jersey and you lived in the suburbs or in the city where you could
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.580]   do those things easily, that would be worth considering.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.260]   Think about which would be better for your career.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.020]   In general, taxes matter a lot, but you can always earn more money to pay for taxes.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.900]   So if you're in a career that you like, then think about how that impacts your career,
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.020]   educational options.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.300]   Think about the growing economy in a place.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:40.840]   If you live in a certain place and think about how that's going to affect your housing values.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.820]   Now if we get to the numbers and we say, what are the costs?
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.820]   You first would compare any cost that you can calculate.
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.380]   So obvious thing that you can calculate is property taxes.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.300]   Do I have a $10,000 per year property bill or a $0 property bill?
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.780]   That's a big, big deal.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.940]   Then you want to then go and say, but what else would change?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.880]   Are there, is the actual house acquisition cost higher or lower?
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.620]   Are the utilities higher or lower?
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.900]   Are groceries higher or lower?
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.140]   Is there a change in sales taxes that's higher or lower from one place to another?
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.580]   Would there be additional transportation expenses that are higher or lower?
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.920]   One thing to think about is what costs are deductible and what costs are not.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:27.140]   So the cost of property taxes generally would be deductible, as is the cost generally of
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.100]   mortgage interest if you itemize on your taxes.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.080]   Whereas the costs of commuting are not deductible.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.100]   So if you're going to incur an extra $2,000 per year of commuting expenses that's not
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.840]   deductible, calculate and see if it might be better for you to have property taxes and
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.820]   interest expense that is deductible.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:51.220]   Now if you're struggling this much with the decision, if the savings on mortgage taxes,
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:57.660]   sorry, the savings on property taxes are zero, you go from whatever the bill is to zero and
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.420]   you're still struggling with the decision, there's probably no clear financial solution
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.540]   to that.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.140]   And you've probably already made the spreadsheets to try to compare it.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.420]   So I would just say pick where you want to live.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.820]   Pick which place you're more excited about.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.560]   And then think finally about culture.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.940]   I would not live in New Jersey because of the political environment and the cultural
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.940]   environment.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.420]   For me it would feel like living in a prison, for me to live in New Jersey.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.460]   Now I don't know that Pennsylvania is a lot better, I've never lived in Pennsylvania,
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.540]   but if I had to choose just knowing what I know about the states, I would choose Pennsylvania
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.740]   in a heartbeat to not live under the New Jersey government.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.140]   But I'm a wacko and that stuff matters.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.900]   So you just think about, I would say do the financial calculations but then go back and
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.420]   say what are you more interested in?
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.340]   What really, where do you think would be a better place for your children to grow up
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.580]   and where are more career options?
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.300]   That would be my answer.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.700]   >>Joseph: Okay.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:57.620]   Now when it comes to relocation, if we're just owning a house, you know, less than five
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:03.220]   years, can you talk a little bit about the 1031 exchange and how does that work?
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.660]   >>Tavis: You can't use a 1031 exchange for a house that you're personally living in.
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.260]   You can only use a 1031 exchange for rental property.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.480]   So the best thing to do is if you've lived in the house that you're living in for a couple
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:18.060]   of years, the best thing to do is simply sell it, take the profit, hopefully you have profit,
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.620]   take the capital gains profit, and you'll be eligible, if you're eligible, you've lived
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:27.900]   in it for the last five years, you'll be eligible for up to $500,000 of tax-free capital gains
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.020]   which was split between you and your wife.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.340]   But you can't use a 1031 exchange on your personal residence.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.980]   >>Joseph: All right, and that's $500,000?
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:44.380]   >>Tavis: $250,000 per person, so for a married couple filing jointly, it's $500,000 of gain
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.420]   that's exempt from income tax.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   >>Joseph: Got it.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.420]   All right, Joshua, thank you so much for your time.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.540]   Thank you for calling in.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.660]   We go on and stay in New Jersey.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.300]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.260]   Tell me your name, please, and share your question.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:05.860]   >>Lucas: Coming from New Jersey.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.380]   >>Joseph: Yes, tell me, I'm sorry, I missed your name.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.380]   Say it again, please.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.380]   >>Lucas: It's Lucas.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.380]   >>Joseph: Lucas, go ahead, sir.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:18.500]   >>Lucas: Hey, so first of all, I just want to say your listeners who are both financial
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.420]   geeks and surfers got very excited when you started talking about Nicaragua and Costa
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.940]   Rica, so we are all in favor of that.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.940]   >>Joseph: You know what?
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:34.260]   So, of course, Costa Rica has tremendous surf all up and down the Pacific Coast, and then
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.580]   Nicaragua also has good surf up and down the Pacific Coast.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.380]   Of those two, I would probably rather do, Costa Rica's fine, and Costa Rica's probably
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.940]   more comfortable for most people, but I like Nicaragua, and I think it'd be more interesting
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.100]   for many people, but the place that I would do it if I were in Nicaragua is right next
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:58.960]   to Playa Colorado, which is well known as a surf beach, and there are two communities
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.340]   right next to each other.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.900]   There's one in Playa Colorado, and then there's the other, the Tarancho Santana, and both
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.980]   of them have great surf breaks, come from all over.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.100]   And then you've got San Juan del Sur, and a number of other places as well.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.980]   So yeah, I will take that into consideration.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.140]   >>Lucas: Very cool, very cool, thank you.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:22.060]   So I'm calling in today to talk about a situation I thought some of your other listeners might
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:27.180]   be in, and it has to do with my parents.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.020]   They are wonderful people, we have a great relationship.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:40.420]   They gave my siblings and I a lot in the way of love and values and the importance of education.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:48.300]   However, there's pretty glaring lack of their own self-education in terms of savings, particularly
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.260]   for retirement, but really just financial planning in general.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:59.460]   And they're both getting into their mid to late 60s now, and where the end would normally
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.520]   be in sight for a lot of people who are in their age group, it doesn't seem like they
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:11.380]   have much of an ability to plan for a retirement at this point.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.860]   Very minimal financial assets, I'm talking to the tune of what would normally make up
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.700]   an emergency fund for an early 20-year-old.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:30.860]   They have a house that is not paid off, still over $100,000 in a mortgage, and not a whole
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.920]   lot of opportunity to increase income.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:41.100]   My dad is a self-employed artist, he doesn't have a whole lot of ceiling, or I'm sorry,
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.420]   he has a ceiling when it comes to how much he can bring in.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:55.500]   My mom does a little bit better, but their total income is below $60,000 on a pre-tax
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.500]   basis.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:04.780]   So, once again, I got great parents, they set us up very well to do well for ourselves,
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:10.500]   and we want to be able to give back, mostly in the way of trying to help them stabilize
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.540]   themselves so they can have something that looks like a retirement at all.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:20.540]   Of course, we would never let them go to the poor house, we would never let them become
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.940]   destitute, but we also want to respect their desire for independence.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:31.940]   So, my sister and I have put together what we thought was a very comprehensive financial
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.200]   plan.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:40.620]   What it does hinge on is one piece of information about their property.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:46.340]   They have, for our neighborhood, they have a double, functionally a double-wide property,
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:54.060]   but with some variance, they might be able to subdivide, keep the house on one of the
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:40:01.140]   lots and sell off the other lot, basically for a profit, and use that profit as a nest
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.580]   egg to start investing and building some kind of retirement portfolio.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.740]   Where I get uncomfortable is that is subject to a lot of people's decisions who don't have
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.860]   my parents' best interest in mind, the municipal planning board, zoning board.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.660]   We're in the process of getting a site plan together with an engineering firm, we're in
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:27.780]   the process of working with a lawyer who will represent us before the board when we go through.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.860]   But everyone I've talked to has said there's kind of a 50/50 shot of if this is going to
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.420]   go through or not, and if it doesn't, I don't really have too many ideas.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:44.060]   So I'm wondering, is there anything that I'm missing, anything else that I can be doing
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.820]   in terms of trying to set my parents up so they can have something that looks like a
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.820]   retirement?
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.800]   Are they open to these conversations, they're sharing information freely, and they're open
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.100]   to your input and soliciting your advice?
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.220]   Yes, yeah, very open.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:01.660]   Probably I guess several months ago at this point, my sister and I laid out things very
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.540]   clearly, we set up scenarios, we did a pretty comprehensive financial sheet.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.340]   Neither of us are in the financial or accounting industry, but we're both engineers, we have
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.340]   pretty good data analytic and mathematical competencies.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:23.020]   So we laid it out for them and they were receptive, but it's just a matter of kind of kick-starting
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.940]   things and how do we get it through.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.260]   And the first step is really this property subdivision, seeing if we can get that to
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.980]   work.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.580]   What do your parents want to do for the next 20-30 years of their life?
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.180]   What's their ideal vision?
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:44.260]   Well, I figured we would get here.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:49.620]   My dad wants to keep working, he loves the work he's doing, he wants to keep doing it
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.100]   forever, but he does not have a planning bone in his body.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.300]   And my mom wants something that looks more traditional like a retirement, be able to
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:07.500]   visit her eventual grandkids, not have to think about working in a restricted setting,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.580]   9-5, 50 weeks a year, that kind of thing.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:18.460]   At the moment, other than their home mortgage, do they have any other significant debt?
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.280]   At this time, no.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:25.180]   And how much equity is in the property if they sold everything?
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.020]   How much equity do you estimate do they have in their house?
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:34.740]   I would guess somewhere in the range of $80,000 to $90,000.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:42.260]   So I think the first thing is, you're probably going to fail at trying to turn your parents
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.740]   into investors at this point.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.220]   That doesn't seem realistic to me.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:52.160]   If somebody has lived 60 years and they've not become a wealth accumulator, they're probably
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.860]   not going to become a wealth accumulator unless they have some major thing that, major reason
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.460]   why it becomes important to them.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.380]   So they're probably not going to magically just change and start saying, "No, you know
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.100]   what, son, what we really want to do is we really want to save and invest money."
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.780]   It's never been important to them.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.420]   Now maybe they decide at this point it is important to them and they do change.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:18.060]   I'm not denying that people can change no matter what age, just saying that it's probably
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.180]   not going to happen.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.800]   If history is any guide, it's not that important to them.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.980]   They're probably not going to change.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.160]   So where do we go from here?
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.720]   I think the first thing to do is to try to help your parents develop a vision of what
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.800]   they're hoping to do over the next 20 or 30 years.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.040]   What's fascinating is that this is what the AARP does now.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:46.720]   The AARP used to promote and push this idea of, "We're helping you so that you and your
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.160]   spouse can walk arm in arm down the beach with your khaki pants rolled up and the silver
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.720]   hairs on your head, enjoying your new beach house."
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.160]   They used to push that old idea of retirement.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.860]   But it's not happening.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.440]   That's not what most people are doing.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:07.400]   So the AARP has kind of readjusted many of their things to be all about the next phase,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.600]   the real possibilities, I think is their slogan now.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.040]   They don't really call themselves the American Association of Retired Persons.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.080]   They're all about, "What's this phase of your life?"
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.560]   To me, that's the right thing.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.640]   You've I'm sure heard me talk about retirement, but I don't think that the basic concept of
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.120]   retirement as quitting from life is healthy for people.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.560]   It's not good for their bodies, not good for their brains, not good for that.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.720]   But what they can do though is they can adjust to say, "What is a lifestyle that we would
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.320]   be really excited about?" and build that.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.800]   And then once that lifestyle is crystallized, then we can start to figure out how do we
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.560]   fund that lifestyle?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.820]   You mentioned that your dad's an artist.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.400]   What kind of art does he do?
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.400]   Stained glass.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.320]   So he needs a workshop then.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   He needs a...
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   Okay.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   Right.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:45:02.600]   So once they get a clear idea of what they'd like to do, then I think they can adjust their
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.800]   living in some way to fit that.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:13.180]   So the first thing I like to do is to say, let's try to make...
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.140]   I'm trying to think of the order to go through this.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:21.940]   So if your parents have wanted a lifestyle, let's say that your parents say, "What we
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.100]   really want to do is travel."
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.100]   Let's use that.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.100]   Do they talk about travel?
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.100]   Do they have any interest in travel?
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.100]   Okay.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.100]   More now than ever.
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.100]   Okay.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:36.420]   And if they were going to travel, what would be their ideal way to travel?
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:43.820]   They're not really cruise ship people, but definitely going places, walking around, not
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.740]   hostile level, but not the Ritz-Carlton either.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.100]   Do you think they're RV type people?
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.540]   I think they could be.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.700]   So just as an example, let's say that your parents said, "We want to travel."
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.980]   And you say, "Well, Mom and Dad, I want to help you travel, but you don't have hundreds
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   of thousands of dollars."
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:07.740]   Well, there are lots and lots of couples in their 60s who make their living traveling
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.780]   in an RV, doing a combination of different things, one of which would be work camping,
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:20.340]   staying at campgrounds where they basically serve as a host for the campground and they
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.660]   check people in, et cetera.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.780]   And for that, they get discounted accommodation.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.820]   They get free accommodation.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:33.700]   And with that free accommodation, that allows them to live in their RV and to be happy.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.500]   So what I would do is I would try to probe them and I would say, "Is there something
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.160]   like this that appeals to you?"
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.900]   Because what could happen is if that did appeal to them, depending on how much money your
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.820]   dad makes on the stained glass and things like that, then let's say that they said,
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.820]   "We're going to work.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.340]   We're going to keep on being active.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.980]   We like to travel.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.820]   We know we don't have a ton of money.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.180]   So what we're going to do is we're going to buy an RV.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.980]   We're going to do work camping and we're going to keep doing, we're going to set up a little
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.140]   trailer or buy a bunk house or whatever your dad needs for a shop that he can use for his
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.060]   stained glass projects.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.220]   And we're going to live in the RV and we're going to go north in the summer and south
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.340]   in the winter.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   And then what we'll do is we will subdivide the house, sell off the lot.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:18.940]   We'll rent out our primary house for a rental income so that we keep that house in case
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.500]   we want to move back to it and we'll rent that one out.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.660]   And then we'll use the money for a second house as a down payment on another rental
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.660]   house.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.460]   And we'll try to get to the point where we have one or two rental houses and then our
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:34.900]   work camping provides for most of our living expenses and we make it up with the additional
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.100]   stained glass income as well.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:42.960]   A couple who's living on the road frugally can live on the road really at any budget.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.020]   People can do it on less than a thousand dollars a month, but many times people will do it
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.020]   on a few thousand dollars a month.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.900]   That's very reasonable, a couple to three thousand dollars a month.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:55.900]   So maybe something like that would be a lifestyle they would really be excited about.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.200]   And then in terms of the finances, the most important thing is that your parents not take
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   Social Security until 70.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.800]   They want to stretch out their Social Security as much as possible so that Social Security
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.060]   benefit is as high as possible, which means they've got to have a transition plan right
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.780]   now for the next 10 years.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.420]   And they've got to have a transition plan that doesn't make them feel like, "Well, we're
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.180]   just hating life and we're suffering."
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.460]   So that's where I come to say, "What would you like to do?"
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:23.580]   And so if you can make the transition plan with a lifestyle that they would be encouraged
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.340]   by with seasonal employment such as work camping, etc.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.180]   And again, even your dad with the stained glass, maybe what they do is they set up a
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.040]   place in the wintertime when it's harder to get work camping jobs and he does stained
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.320]   glass in the wintertime.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.140]   But then all summer they head north and they go to their different work camping locations
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.860]   up in the north.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:48.060]   And then if you use the house, rent it out, and see if they can work towards another rental
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:56.000]   house as well, that would be the kind of thing which would provide them with income for themselves.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.880]   One use if you fail to subdivide the property, one use of the property might be to actually
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   use it.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.820]   Well, it may not be possible with HOA regulations or something.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.940]   Obviously, you're having problems with the local municipal people.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.980]   But if you can use it as a place for them to park their RV.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:15.700]   Maybe they buy something like whatever kind of RV, something small so it's easy for them
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.260]   to handle and fuel efficient and good cost.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.700]   But if they have a fifth wheel or some place they can park their RV, build a shed on the
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.460]   second lot, put a nice place where they can have full hookups for an RV, then when they
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:32.500]   come back during the wintertime, they can come back to their own house.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.780]   But they have a tenant in the house and they just live on the second property in their
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   RV.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.820]   Something like that could work for as well.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.260]   You know, as many times as I've heard you talk about RVing, that never occurred to me
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.460]   and that's a really good idea.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.460]   It's fantastic.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.220]   First of all, I love RVing.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.860]   I have a wanderlust bone in my body.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.660]   Every bone in my body has a wanderlust.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.660]   But I love RVing.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:50:01.160]   And if you go and you talk to work campers, for people in this phase of life, it is one
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.820]   of the best situations for them.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.080]   Nobody gets rich doing it.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.380]   They're not going to get rich.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.860]   But what they can do is they can defray their living expenses.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.820]   They've got to have some money and some income, which I think is where a rental house would
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.820]   be helpful.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   And then having some savings.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.720]   They've got to have savings as well.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.980]   Because they've got to buy a rig.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.480]   They've got to take care of it.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.060]   But the work campers, they'll often work something like a week on, week off.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.540]   But the work is right outside the door of their RV.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.620]   Depending on where they go, if they're a big campground, they could be very busy.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.040]   If it's a remote campground, they don't actually have that much work to do.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.060]   And the lifestyle of it, there are lots and lots of older people RVing.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.500]   And so they're constantly meeting people.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   You always see them.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.100]   They're there at eight o'clock at night, sipping wine out by their fire.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   Life is good.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.220]   And every now and then they go up and check somebody in.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.820]   But I've known a lot of work campers who really love it.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:53.480]   And for an ability to defray expenses so that you can generate more capital for the next
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.900]   phase is really a good solution.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.860]   And if they're healthy and active, it could be the kind of thing where your mom doesn't
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.060]   have to do the nine to five.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.860]   She does the primary customer service work.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.620]   Oftentimes couples will be working together.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.940]   You'll very frequently see that where they're in the office together.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.100]   I've been in many campgrounds and you go up at eight o'clock at night and the husband
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.860]   and wife, the work campers in charge are up in the guard shack.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   But they've got the TV on, they've got a little lamp, they're sitting in a comfortable chair.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.980]   And if somebody comes in and does a late check-in, they're there to serve them.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.380]   But they're spending their evenings together.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:29.780]   They just happen to be getting paid in terms of a free place to park, free utilities, or
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.740]   sometimes a small stipend as well.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:37.420]   So, I think if you'll help your parents develop ideas about what they would really like to
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.940]   do, what they'd really like the future to look like, then I think you've got a positive
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.940]   direction to go in.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.620]   And then you can just try to help adjust the finances on the back end.
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.560]   And that may just simply mean a different job for your mom.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.020]   If your dad likes his stained glass work and he might say, "I can't take my workshop on
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.020]   the road.
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.020]   Are you kidding me?
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.020]   And I don't want to just do it in the wintertime.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.020]   I want to do it all year round."
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:02.300]   Then the solution might be to say, "Mom, how can we adjust your career into something that's
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.460]   not draining for you?
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:08.140]   Do you want to be a receptionist at the local Puppy Pound to work with animals?
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.100]   Or do you want to work with kindergartners because you love children?
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.840]   Is there a way that we can make it exciting for you to go to work?"
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.060]   Going to work 40 hours a week is not a draining bad thing unless you're in a bad fit for you
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.220]   as a job.
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:27.020]   And so, for every person in that situation, there is an opportunity that they would really
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.020]   enjoy.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.980]   It might be taking care of horses.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.180]   It might be trimming dogs' hair.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.780]   It might be blacksmithing.
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.980]   I don't know.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:40.500]   But there are so many things that we can do now that we can earn a great wage, can keep
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:46.100]   our life, keep things going, and really enjoy our time at work.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.980]   The final thing I would say is for people like that, I think you should be very careful
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.720]   with their investment options.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.460]   And I think that you should probably think carefully about real estate.
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.500]   Real estate is intuitive for people in a way that mutual funds are not.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:04.760]   So think about, is there a way that we can rent out their house, have it paid down?
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.240]   Can they wind up with a couple of rental trailers or a couple of rental houses?
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.760]   That way they know, "Mom and Dad, you don't spend this capital.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.000]   This money, you just spend the income."
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.800]   Because that's intuitive for people in a way that mutual funds are not.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.560]   And then if you make sure they go out to 70 with their working, that'll solve it.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:27.420]   If they can work till 70 in some form or another, they could probably live on their Social Security
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.420]   income.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.000]   Check those numbers as well in your spreadsheets.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   So those are my thoughts, Lucas.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.960]   Good for you for getting involved with your parents' money.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.440]   I'm glad it's going well.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.560]   >>Lucas: Thanks so much, Joshua.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.560]   I appreciate it.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.560]   >>Steve: My pleasure.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.480]   We go now to Texas.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.800]   Daniel in Texas, welcome to the show.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:47.960]   How can I serve you today, Daniel?
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.960]   Daniel in Texas.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   >>Daniel: Hold on.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Sorry.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   >>Steve: There we go.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   >>Daniel: How can I serve you?
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   >>Steve: So question.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:00.480]   We've previously talked about my business some, but I am now...
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:09.840]   I guess the base question is how do you use creating content to build a product business?
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:16.320]   So I am selling a gluten and grain-free brownie mix off tiltedbrownies.com, if anyone wants
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   to look it up.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   >>Daniel: Hold on.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.320]   Hold on.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.320]   Hold on.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   Hold on one second.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   >>Steve: I'm sorry.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   >>Daniel: Hold on.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   >>Steve: Off tiltedbrownies.com.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.720]   Off tiltedbrownies.com, your central source for gluten-free brownies.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.720]   Did I get that right?
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   >>Daniel: There you go.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   They're so good, they'll knock your tilt off.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   >>Steve: Nice.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   >>Daniel: There you go.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:43.360]   So I am putting up blog content Monday through Friday on our website, recipes, gluten-free
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.720]   living, stuff that interests me.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:55.280]   So I guess a lot of it is I'm doing it to help people and to make their lives better.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:01.520]   Part of it's a gross thing for me as well, but ultimately all aspects of what we do with
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.000]   our business we hope helps grow the business and make more money off of it.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.120]   So do you have any thoughts?
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.480]   Obviously your business is primarily content, and even the content you sell as a product
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   is content.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:19.240]   Do you have any thoughts on how to maybe use that more to help grow the business?
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.720]   >>Steve: Do you work exclusively locally or do you work nationally?
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.920]   >>Daniel: I am selling online nationally.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.280]   >>Steve: Okay.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.960]   So in that case, then the web serves you very well.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.680]   And of course the web can serve you locally as well, but it's just very different if you
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.760]   have a national presence.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.120]   Tell me about your social media strategy.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:51.240]   >>Daniel: It's probably lacking, let's be honest.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:56.160]   So my brother handles the social media stuff.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.960]   We're trying to post a couple times a week on Facebook.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:10.880]   We're posting a couple times a week on Instagram, trying to get into Pinterest and such as well,
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.760]   but primarily Facebook and Instagram.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.320]   Partially I would say our primary outlet is we sell at a farmer's market on Saturday morning.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.800]   So there's definitely stuff related to the farmer's market.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.920]   There's a Saturday morning post that goes out on both Instagram and Facebook, "Hey,
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.440]   come check us out," blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.400]   My brother is as well trying to kind of taking, I don't know how familiar you are with Gary
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:46.200]   V., but trying to take his kind of Instagram 180 strategy, basically going high engagement
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.600]   on other people's content on Instagram.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:56.920]   My brother's doing that some, not to the level that Gary V. thinks you should, but to a fairly
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:02.720]   high level, basically trying to do meaningful interaction with at least 20 pieces of other
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.880]   people's content on Instagram every day.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.640]   And then I am, I'm posting on Facebook.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:20.160]   I'm posting when I put the blog post out, I'll post on, I'm also on Mimi, but on, do
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.360]   a Facebook thing with our meta description and a link to the blog post.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.840]   I've also started just for the heck of it, putting it on LinkedIn to see if anything
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   happens there.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   I don't know if it will, but.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.720]   - It's hard to imagine how LinkedIn is going to serve you or Twitter.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.280]   So I think the biggest thing is what's your strategy?
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.960]   Well, your strategy is to provide something great that people really love, but you've
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.960]   got to get discovered.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   So how do you get discovered?
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:48.680]   Well, in my opinion, social media is going to be your obvious solution here because the
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:53.920]   discoverability on social media, especially Instagram with the right communities, the
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:58:01.280]   right gluten-free communities and the right recipe sites, et cetera, is going to be your
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.480]   best option, your biggest seller.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:08.880]   So if you think about what is somebody who's gluten-free, what are they looking for?
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.000]   What I would do is try to profile the things that somebody who's gluten-free is looking
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.280]   for and all of it.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.320]   Part of that of course is brownies, but then everything else.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:24.800]   And so if you look at the communities, there are so many big pages and so many big brands
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   and groups and organized communities of people who specialize in gluten-free that you simply
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.020]   need to focus on being findable there.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.960]   I don't know how to do it specifically.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.120]   I would say Gary Vee's course is the great place to go.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.760]   And absolutely one of the most important things is to be active in promoting other people's
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   things.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:53.800]   And so what I would do is I would hardly ever post an Instagram, maybe once a week is fine.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.320]   But if you're making first two Instagram posts per week is insufficient.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.880]   But if you're making 20 posts per week, you say four of them are going to be about what
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:07.440]   I'm doing and 16 of them are going to be about what everyone else is doing.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.680]   And so let's just not just focus on brownies, let's show what other people are doing.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:18.320]   And in so doing, you start to build friends for yourself in that community to show people,
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:22.280]   "Hey, look, we're committed and we're part of this community.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.800]   We offer this niche product that you would like."
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:29.080]   I would imagine also that if you do a little searching for education, that there's a lot
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:35.720]   of education out there for how you can really spread your physical product with other people
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.760]   in the influencer space.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.840]   So whether that means going to Gluten Free Con or Keto Con or whatever it is, whatever
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.040]   conference it is, and buying a booth there, what you've got to do is you've got to get
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:54.140]   your brand known by the people who are already in this space.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:59.480]   Do you have an affiliate program on your website that other influencers can sign up for?
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.920]   I do not.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.720]   So that would be an easy thing to do is if you have a great product, set up an affiliate
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:13.560]   program with your shopping cart so that influencers can sign up for your affiliate code and then
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.120]   start to see if you can market that affiliate program to other influencers in the Gluten
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.760]   Free community.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.160]   Because people who are in the Gluten Free community, a well-known, could be a blogger,
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.760]   could be a YouTuber, I mean, the platform is immaterial.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.440]   It doesn't matter what platform.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.440]   People who are serving the Gluten Free community need a way to make money off of what they're
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   doing.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.720]   So their monetization options are a few things.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.160]   They can develop things for themselves.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.880]   They can sell their own products, whether it's a cookbook or a t-shirt or a course,
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   etc.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:50.960]   But one of the most powerful forms of revenue creation for an influencer is affiliate marketing,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.240]   is getting an influencer to market your product as part of their overall system.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.020]   So you've got to have an affiliate program and then use that affiliate program also for
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:07.560]   people who are other kinds of people.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.760]   One of the other things I would do is I would look and research.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.240]   There's got to be a half a dozen companies doing monthly box memberships of Gluten Free
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.800]   content, of Gluten Free recipes, Gluten Free stuff.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.000]   There's got to be at least a half a dozen of those out there.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.800]   So I would find the people who are doing that and I would place your product in that.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.200]   A long time ago in the archives of Radical Personal Finance, I did an interview with
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   somebody, I can't place the name right now, but who specialized in this kind of product
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.200]   placement.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.560]   So I would work with some of the consultants.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.800]   I would take their classes, their courses.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.960]   Somebody's created a course on it and I would just focus on product placement and then making
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.600]   it easy for people to buy.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.120]   I think one of the...
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:52.680]   Are you also selling through something like Amazon FBA in addition to your own website?
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.880]   I have not figured it out for Amazon yet, no.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.080]   It is on my radar, but it seems rather tricky.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:07.760]   So that would be high on my priority list if I were you as well because one of the challenges
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.260]   of buying from somebody is oftentimes it's hard for people to set up a buying relationship
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.480]   with a new mail order vendor.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.480]   And so it's a hassle.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.880]   I got to go to their website, I got to put in my address, I got to put in my credit card,
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   etc.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.140]   And so if you can profitably distribute, I don't know if there's any downside of distributing
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.460]   with Amazon FBA, but if you can profitably distribute through the platforms that many
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:35.480]   people are already using where they just simply pull out their Amazon app, they click buy
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:40.760]   and there's two-day shipping and boom, it's at their house, that can also be a way of
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.400]   expanding things.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.320]   And then I would think a lot about how do you feature your customers?
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.600]   So tell me a little bit at this point about what you're doing to feature your customers
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:57.840]   and to get them posting online about what you're doing.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.840]   Not much.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:08.680]   We've tried to push some for if people will give us an online review that will show it
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.960]   to us, whatever, that we will give them 10% off.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.400]   To be quite frank, I've been pushing getting signups on our email list more than doing
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400]   that.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:25.160]   I feel like there's only so many things you can yell at someone in person.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   No question.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   Sharing information.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   What I would do is...
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.560]   So probably nothing basically.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:36.240]   So the idea is try to figure out how to profile your customers, especially in the Instagram
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:45.200]   world when everybody loves to show what they're doing, what they're cooking, etc., especially
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.640]   in the gluten-free world.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.720]   So figure out how to run contests and customer appreciation things on Instagram, all the
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.040]   contests for free bags of brownies, etc.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.440]   There are worlds out there.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.080]   It's not my thing, so I haven't studied it in detail, but I just watch and I can see
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.100]   what's working by what people are doing.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.680]   So go and figure out how to do that to engage the people there.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.840]   And then, I mean, those are a lot of tactical solutions.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.840]   I love the fact that you're doubling down on your brand.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.600]   I'm looking at your page here.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.820]   You guys are in kilts and that's fun.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.880]   So entertaining things as well.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:31.720]   If you look at some of the brands that have built a big following, usually you wind up
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.920]   creating a cult of some kind.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.560]   The goal is to create a cult and a cult has to have personality.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.160]   It has to have something that's differentiating about it.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.000]   So have you studied the...
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.800]   I guess the last thing is, have you gone out and searched for the big products that are
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.600]   out there and kind of studied their marketing, the people who are doing really well?
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   Somewhat.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.360]   I could probably do more of it.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:06.120]   I've been trying to figure out the balance of trying to find the, I guess, independents
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:12.160]   who are being successful on a large scale versus the large companies who've just kind
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.840]   of jumped into the space and using their Betty Crocker.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.600]   And he just says, "Well, I'm Betty Crocker and now we offer a gluten-free thing."
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.800]   Well, I think I'm about out of...
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.720]   I guess I just want to close this particular question out because it's a little bit out
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.520]   of the realm of personal finance, just simply by saying that the better that you can articulate
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.000]   why you guys are different and the better you can just simply focus on showing your
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.960]   customers how special what they're doing is.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:43.600]   If you're making these things in your kitchen, I would be making that very clear.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.120]   Show pictures of you making the things in your kitchen so that when somebody buys the
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   brownie mix, they're happy.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.800]   They're not buying from Betty Crocker.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.280]   They're buying from Off-Kilter Brownies.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:58.000]   But I would focus on how the big brands are promoting their things.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.120]   One of your most important areas of promotion is going to be setting up a proper affiliate
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:09.920]   code and figuring out how to get influencers to like your product, to try your product,
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.160]   to like your product, and then to rep your product towards their audience.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.840]   Yes, you need to build your brand.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.160]   You need to build your profiles.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:26.160]   But at the end of the day, if you can go to that gluten-free, I don't know, Jane's Gluten-Free
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:33.360]   Resource where she just does nothing except gluten-free products and gluten-free baking,
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.320]   and she can profile you on her YouTube channel that has 300,000 subscribers, and she says,
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.520]   "By the way, go and get these Off-Kilter Brownies.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.840]   Use my special link.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.080]   Get 20% off."
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.800]   And Jane also gets her commission for promoting that.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.440]   That's the type of thing that will quickly get you from selling a few dozen packages
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.920]   to many thousands of packages.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.640]   You're going to have to leverage that.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.680]   So as far as I'm concerned, that would be one of the first areas I'd focus on.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   Hope that helps.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.280]   I just say I'm not the right solution for this beyond that, but there are people out
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.840]   there who are teaching this, and so you've got to find them and find their advice, because
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.080]   they're going to know how to do it better than me.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080]   That works.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080]   Thank you.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   Great.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.080]   Thanks for calling in, Daniel.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.080]   All right, we go now to Massachusetts.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.680]   Andrew in Massachusetts.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   Welcome to the show.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.680]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.280]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:29.840]   I believe that you've covered in previous shows the permanent portfolio as a way to
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.560]   sort of set up a passive investing strategy.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:45.200]   And also, you've talked on some episodes a bit about using whole life insurance policies
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.800]   similar to, I guess it goes by different names, the infinite banking concept, where you sort
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:58.680]   of utilize the cash value in your policy where it makes sense.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:05.880]   And I'm wondering if there might be, for someone who's interested in the permanent portfolio
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.840]   and also interested in perhaps getting some life insurance, if using, because one of the
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:20.600]   components of the permanent portfolio, of course, is the cash portion that some strategies,
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:26.760]   some people who implement strategy say to invest that in short-term treasuries, like
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.400]   one to three-year treasuries.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.400]   But I'm wondering if, now, obviously, it's not as liquid, but I'm wondering if it might
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.360]   make sense to actually, for the cash portion of one's permanent portfolio, if they're pursuing
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:48.640]   that methodology, actually look at trying to fit that into a whole life insurance policy
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.320]   that sort of serves as the cash portion.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.040]   I was wondering what you thought about that, if there are any pros and cons to that or
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040]   what.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040]   Interesting.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:06.780]   Let me give 90 seconds of background for other listeners while I consider your question.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:13.580]   The permanent portfolio was basically originally developed by Harry Brown, who was an investment
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.660]   advisor.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:19.220]   And he was trying to figure out what is a simple investment strategy that could work
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.620]   no matter the economic conditions.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:28.180]   And originally, he started out by recommending a strategy that included stocks, bonds, cash,
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:31.660]   gold, silver, Swiss francs, natural resources, et cetera.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.740]   But over time, it became simplified to simply say, you keep 25% of your money in stocks,
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:42.260]   you keep 25% of your money in bonds, you keep 25% of your money in cash, and you keep 25%
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.860]   of your money in gold.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:51.900]   And by doing that and then rebalancing basically once per year, you have assets that can perform
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.460]   in every economic condition.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:03.320]   And the brilliance of the strategy is that it focuses on protecting yourself from different
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.020]   economic movements.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.180]   So at some points, stocks do well, you profit some from stocks.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.420]   Some points, bonds do well.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.060]   Some points, cash moves does well.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.980]   Sometimes gold does well.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:21.220]   But you're hedged against the different macroeconomic movements of an economy, the movements of
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.800]   the Federal Reserve, et cetera.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:30.380]   And most people would acknowledge that it's probably never going to be the superior performing
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:35.860]   investment strategy, but it's also going to generally always be a good performing investment
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.900]   strategy.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:42.060]   The best book on it that I would recommend to start with is go back and read the book
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.420]   by Craig Rowland and J.M. Lawson called The Permanent Portfolio, where they dug into it
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.420]   in depth.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.980]   And the great thing about that book is they talked a lot about the practical applications
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:56.700]   of it, different specifics that you can use, different companies, different ways that you
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.700]   can do it.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:58.820]   What should you hold your gold, for example?
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:04.020]   Should you buy gold ETFs or should you have physical gold in your gun safe or should you
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.460]   store gold in your private vault in Austria?
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.540]   It's different.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:13.420]   What do you hold for your stock portfolio, index funds, other things, et cetera?
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:20.100]   So now I've given 90 seconds of background, I still don't have a good answer to your question.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:27.320]   On the one hand, I don't see a basic problem with that because in many ways, the portfolio
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:34.180]   values that are in life insurance can often be viewed and logged as a cash asset.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:40.660]   For all intents and purposes, they are functionally equivalent to a cash asset because in a traditional
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:46.300]   whole life insurance policy, the policy values are guaranteed to increase by the insurance
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.380]   company.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:53.100]   Now we always want to be a little bit careful of actually booking them as a cash asset because
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:12:00.100]   in many insurance policies, the insurance company has the right to delay a distribution
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:05.400]   or a loan request for a certain period of time.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   Sometimes that can be months.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.260]   I don't remember exactly, but maybe six months with some insurance companies and some policies.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:17.800]   But as a matter of practice, I have never in my career heard of a company actually exercising
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.880]   that policy right.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.380]   As a matter of practice, you can get a wire transfer out of your whole life insurance
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.340]   policy in 24 hours.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:31.160]   So I view my life insurance cash values, I view them as a cash asset.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.540]   I book them as cash.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.660]   But what are those assets invested in?
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:44.980]   Well, a lot of the assets inside of a life insurance policy are invested in bonds.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:49.180]   Depending on the company, they're heavy into a bond portfolio.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:56.280]   So is it better to calculate a life insurance portfolio as a bond portfolio or as part of
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.820]   your bond allocation or your cash allocation?
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.940]   I don't know.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.780]   In many ways, it's not your problem how the insurance company is investing.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.380]   You just care about the end contract.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   You don't care if this insurance company has 80% in fixed income, 10% in stocks, and 10%
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:20.340]   in real estate, or if they have 50% in fixed income and 30% in real estate and 20% in stocks.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:24.500]   You don't care because to you, your cash values are guaranteed to grow up.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:31.180]   So to you, it's functionally equivalent to cash.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:36.920]   What I'm struggling with, and I can't do live here without maybe giving it some more thought.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:48.940]   What I'm struggling with is...
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.740]   The biggest problem would be how does this fit in terms of your accumulation strategy
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.540]   and how do you time it?
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.140]   That's always the challenge with life insurance is because you have to put premiums in, and
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:06.420]   because you have to put premiums in based upon an appropriate comparison with the premium
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.940]   versus the cash value, you simply don't have the same flexibility as just putting money
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.620]   in a cash account.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:17.740]   And then when it comes to an investment portfolio, you're going to have a lot of practical trouble
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:23.260]   actually maintaining the exact cash amount in the life insurance policy that you wouldn't
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.100]   have just simply keeping money in cash.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:32.580]   A life insurance policy is a really useful tool for all the reasons discussed, but it
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:39.260]   has the constraint of needing to be funded with a series of ongoing payments and then
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:44.580]   having certain constraints on the amount of money that you have in it and the amount of
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.580]   money that you don't have in it to keep the policy healthy, especially if you're doing
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.900]   loans, if you're not doing a distribution strategy.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.660]   You've got to keep enough money in the policy to pay the interest on the loan and to keep
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.420]   the policy in force until your death.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:03.500]   So I guess my answer to you with, as you can hear, I'm kind of fumbling a little bit for
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.060]   clarity on the different points involved.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:12.660]   My answer to you would be it's probably fine to calculate in your whole life insurance
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:21.260]   cash values as a component of your overall cash allocation.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:25.540]   Let's say you have a hundred thousand or a million dollars in your portfolio and you're
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:28.660]   going to then allocate $250,000 of that to cash.
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.500]   Well, I'm fine if you've got a hundred or $150,000 in a life insurance policy, but then
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:37.380]   just do your rebalancing and such with the other money that's outside of the life insurance
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:42.460]   policy because it'll be more flexible than the life insurance policy.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:47.140]   I guess in theory you could get to a place where you say we've got a universal life insurance
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.340]   contract that gives us more flexibility.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:52.740]   I just personally get nervous about those because they don't have the same benefits
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.900]   of a traditional whole life contract.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:00.340]   I don't think those strategies are mutually, I think they can go together.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.420]   I think they can be friends.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:08.580]   I don't see why bank on yourself and, or infinite banking to use the less hyped version.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:12.740]   I don't think that infinite banking and the permanent portfolio have to be enemies, but
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:18.340]   I haven't thought it through enough to be clear on exactly how to promote them together.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.660]   So that's the best I got for you.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:20.660]   Good question though.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:21.660]   Interesting.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:28.020]   Yeah, that was kind of what was my thinking as well is that if you, you know, obviously
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:34.980]   there's going to be some difficulty in modifying once you have the insurance contract set up
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:40.620]   and you're funding it, but that aside, if you can kind of, if it's an acceptable size
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:46.860]   for your, what you are doing with your permanent portfolio, maybe it can work out, you know,
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:47.860]   okay.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:56.580]   I mean, I don't know that anybody, I'd have to call Jake to Silas.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.760]   He came on the show and talked about permanent portfolio.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.760]   He would be a good guy.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.020]   Call that question into his podcast.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.020]   He runs the voluntary life podcast.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.020]   Yeah, I actually did talk to him about that.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.020]   What did he say?
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.020]   What was his answer?
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:11.180]   Well, you know, I think part of the problem with these two strategies is that you have
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:17.740]   people who are very pro permanent portfolio and you have others who are very much a proponent
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.940]   of this type of, you know, bank on yourself.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:27.820]   And I have had a hard time finding anyone who sort of first understands both strategies.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:32.460]   So you were an obvious thought in my mind since you've covered both topics.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:39.180]   But yeah, I don't think you really, well, I may have not done a very good job explaining.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:45.780]   You certainly hadn't heard of the bank on yourself type of strategy before I brought
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:46.780]   it up to him.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:50.460]   So I think, you know, maybe I didn't do a great job explaining it, but I don't think
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:54.220]   you really saw the value in it.
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:58.140]   The biggest problem with infinite banking slash bank on yourself and just for context
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:02.340]   for listeners, those are basically two different marketing names.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:07.940]   Infinite banking was Nelson Nash and then bank on yourself is Pamela Yellen wrote the
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.940]   books on it.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:14.340]   My problem is always how do we, and this is the thing that's even constrained me personally,
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:19.620]   is you have, because of the constraints in the United States tax code on life insurance
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:26.620]   policies, you have to, you can't fund them as perfectly as, they're not infinitely flexible.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.100]   Usually for the best results, we're going to use a traditional whole life insurance
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:36.660]   contract as compared to, although you can use universal life contract and some of the
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:41.540]   infinite banking people use a few different contracts, but they use some weird companies.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.780]   I've never been sold on some of the companies that some of them represent.
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:49.040]   My opinion, if you're going to buy this kind of life insurance, your options are exclusively
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.300]   the big mutual companies, New York life, mass mutual, Northwestern mutual.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.300]   That's it.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.300]   And generally.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:59.140]   Is Penn Mutual in that grouping?
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.140]   Maybe so.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.700]   I haven't paid much attention to them.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.020]   You just mean companies like that.
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.460]   I mean a mutual company, a company with good history, et cetera, because you're ultimately
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.520]   banking on the power of the insurance company.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.620]   You're not actually a bank.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.100]   You don't actually have the money.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.100]   You're trusting the insurance company to do a good job.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.260]   And so you need to have a mutual insurance company, not a stock company.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.100]   And you need to have a company that's well run, that's stable, that's going to take care
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.360]   of your money.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.220]   It's a big, big deal because you don't have FDIC insurance.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:33.700]   You, yes, you do have the Guarantee Corporation that backs up life insurance contracts, but
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:38.380]   you don't, you're not, you're guaranteed, if you're banking on the guaranteed values
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.780]   inside of a life insurance contract, the whole concept falls apart.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:45.900]   What you're actually trusting is that the company will do a good job paying its dividends,
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:49.500]   the company will be well managed so that you'll get the dividend rate that you're hoping to
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.820]   get, the projected dividend rate, not the basic guarantees within the contract.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.260]   So you need a good company.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.860]   And then you need a flexible company because when you're, depending on how you're going
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:06.180]   to be using it, putting lots of money in, lots of money out, it's not, you know, you
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.340]   need the company, the contract to be the right way.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:13.060]   Then you have to look at the argument that they make about how dividends or how loans
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.640]   are captured in the policies.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:19.200]   And frankly, I just need to read some more about it from some of the people who are really
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.580]   active in the space.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.980]   I set a project for myself a few years ago.
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:27.160]   I bought about, I searched the market, I bought all 15 books I could find on it.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.100]   And I was going to do a big research project, maybe create a product or something that I
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.100]   could sell.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.460]   And I got busy with other things and I just never got back to it.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.980]   So at some point I may do it, is read all the 15 books, do a bunch of interviews with
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.460]   the people, and then try to be that guy who I know insurance and find the problems, find
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:44.380]   the solutions and answer it.
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:49.060]   But to go back to my biggest problem with an insurance policy is I usually would want
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.980]   a good traditional whole life insurance policy.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.820]   We're probably going to want a quick pay policy.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:59.960]   So we're going to want a policy that you put premiums in for 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15 years.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.720]   But those premiums have to be appropriately adjusted to the size of the insurance policy
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.200]   and to your income.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:14.360]   And so the challenge is often, do I have the structure of life that has the income where
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.160]   this is going to make sense?
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:20.240]   And the thing I learned when I used to sell life insurance was I couldn't sell, I made
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.000]   the mistake at some point of selling policies that were too big.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.240]   And what happens is it's all fine and well for the person to sign up for a $100,000 a
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:31.480]   year premium when their business is doing well, but what happens in the next recession?
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.040]   And all of a sudden then you start backing it off and you try to help them adjust the
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.320]   premium, but now it goes from $100 to $50, and even then sometimes the $50,000 premiums
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.520]   fall off.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:45.360]   And so what I came to be frustrated with is that if you do that, a lot of the benefits
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.600]   of the whole life policy simply fall away.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.440]   And I learned not to be so aggressive.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:55.920]   I had too many policies that I had to readjust and that fell off the books.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.400]   And then when you do that, the policy owner gets sunk in the transaction because all the
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.560]   costs came out, the commission came out, et cetera.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:08.040]   But if the policy doesn't stay on the books for a decade, two decades, three decades,
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.320]   then it turns into a bad idea for the policy owner.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.680]   And so where I came back to was that the point of safety was always to back off the amount
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.420]   of premiums.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:22.360]   And so if they were really comfortable with $100,000 a year or really comfortable with
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:28.520]   $20,000 a year or whatever the appropriate thing was, then I would say, "Let's back this
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.120]   off and let's do 70% of it.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.320]   And let's make sure that we have that."
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.800]   And then make sure that policy is just stacked with additional premiums so that if necessary
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.680]   we can back it off for a couple of years if we go through a recession, et cetera.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.080]   Because a lot of times the people who are in this space, who are doing this, might have
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.880]   significant fluctuations in their income.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:53.200]   It's unusual for somebody making $70,000 a year to all of a sudden have massive fluctuations
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.160]   in their income because they're doing that in a job.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:59.800]   But it's also generally not the best idea for somebody making $70,000 a year to be investing
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.320]   primarily through whole life insurance.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.200]   Better for them to be using 401ks, Roth IRAs, et cetera, because they get more bang for
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.200]   the buck.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.120]   So once we move into this space with whole life insurance contracts, we're generally
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:17.080]   going to move into the up markets where people have a lot more income, a lot higher tax burden,
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.480]   where now it's a much more attractive product and they've already maxed out their other
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:23.400]   areas of investments.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.420]   So I never quite solved that problem, but I just have never figured out how infinite
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:31.040]   banking works to do it as everything.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.680]   You need, yes, the policies work for some things, but you need additional assets for
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.680]   yourself.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.800]   The thing that I, the way that I have always looked at whole life insurance contracts is
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.640]   they're a great place to accumulate some money.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.320]   The life insurance benefits are really important to me.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.320]   They're really wonderful.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   I love the fact that they're there, but often there's probably other sources of financing
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.500]   that are preferable to life insurance contract.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:02.080]   So if car financing is easy, I wouldn't take the money out of a life insurance policy so
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.080]   I could pay myself back.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.920]   I'd take a 0% car loan if I borrowed money on cars.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:11.280]   If I were doing something else, I would do it on credit cards.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.940]   And then the life insurance policy is simply there if those other financing mechanisms
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.320]   are not available or they're expensive.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:22.960]   That's when you can leverage it and that's when you, where you can really leverage it
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.400]   effectively to cut your costs of borrowing in other places.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.880]   So I teach this in my credit card course.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.160]   Let's say, let's say you have $200,000 or $100,000 in your whole life insurance contract,
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.440]   but you've got credit card debt that you've accumulated for some reason.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.920]   And I'm assuming here that we're not just, you know, but whatever, whether we're paying
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.600]   it down, you have money in a life insurance contract.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.320]   This is what bugs me so much when people who are teaching people to pay off debt and they
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.080]   always say cash in the life insurance contract.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.480]   Don't cash in the life insurance contract.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.480]   That's dumb.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.360]   What you do is you take a loan against the life insurance contract, use that loan to
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.560]   pay down your credit cards, drop your utilization ratio from whatever it is down to a much better
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.800]   factor.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:04.440]   Let that, let your, let that filter through to your credit reports, bumps up your credit
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.400]   score, then apply for new 0% credit cards.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.920]   Take those new 0% credit cards, borrow on the new ones, either through purchases or
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.560]   balance transfers, and then transfer the money back and pay off the loan in your life insurance
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.760]   contract.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.080]   That's the best way to use a life insurance contract to pay off your credit card debt
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.440]   is to drop your interest rates.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.840]   But you don't want to take that, that money from a safe, you know, protected creditor
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.680]   protected situation, stable, et cetera, and use it to pay off a credit card when you can
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.800]   just simply borrow against it, then put it back in a couple of months and keep paying
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.160]   off the credit card at 0% interest.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.600]   So that's the best I got.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.600]   That's where I'm at.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600]   Yeah, no, that's helpful.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.800]   That was kind of what I was thinking is it's a nice tool to have if you can, you know,
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:54.080]   if you have some extra money that you're looking to invest and, you know, give you some different
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.240]   options depending on the economic environment.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:02.960]   But yeah, I mean, obviously there are restrictions to it and you can, obviously you're committing
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.880]   to some amount of premiums over some period of time.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.140]   It's got to work.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:10.120]   When you talk to him, Jake is still doing permanent portfolio, right?
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.120]   Is he still?
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.120]   Is that still his?
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.120]   Okay, good.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.120]   I believe yes.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   That's right.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.320]   Yeah, I think he's one of the best defenders of it currently because the guys who wrote
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.680]   the book, they used to speak publicly, but they eventually shut their website down.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.360]   They did the book and the book is still good.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.240]   I'm not aware of anything that has to be changed.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.000]   But Jake is, you know, he's financially independent.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   He's living on the portfolio.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   Yeah, I believe you're right about the authors of the book.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.680]   They're kind of doing other things now, but the other guy that I was kind of talking to
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.720]   about these topics was the guy who runs the portfolio charts website.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.640]   I don't know if you've checked that out, but it's kind of interesting.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:59.200]   He looks at maybe a dozen or so different index type portfolios that are sort of, yeah,
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:08.160]   the lazy man style, including, you know, Timothy Robbins, all weather portfolio and some others
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160]   there.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:14.160]   And he actually developed his own just because he's been tinkering with the numbers so much
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.880]   that I'm kind of leaning towards, which is a derivative of the permanent portfolio that
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.400]   is tilted a little more towards stocks, which historically has performed a little bit better
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.840]   than some of these other portfolios, but with a little more volatility that is.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.560]   The key seems to me, as far as I'm looking at it, if we start with the big important
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.600]   rocks first, right, that's what I always want to do.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.160]   Why does something work?
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:46.640]   I think the reason why the permanent portfolio can work and why it's very good is because
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.060]   first it's grounded in good analysis, right?
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:56.240]   It's grounded in this idea of having asset classes that perform differently in all market
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.520]   conditions.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.360]   And then it's simple enough that the investor who reads it and understands it and believes
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.080]   it will stick with it.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:12.320]   Because it seems to me that if we take the amount of time out large enough, almost any
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.240]   thoughtfully created portfolio will work, right?
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.440]   A hundred percent stock portfolio has worked very, very well.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.360]   It's just had a lot of fluctuations.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.280]   A hundred percent real estate portfolio has worked.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.520]   I don't know of anyone who would say a hundred percent gold portfolio has worked as well
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.200]   as you would like.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.920]   That gold just does not perform that way.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:42.880]   But when you own productive assets that generate dividends or generate increases or generate
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.600]   interest, some intelligently put together portfolio is going to work.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:53.960]   The key is, does the person stick with it when things are going hot and when things
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.520]   are going cold?
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.640]   And then do they rebalance over time?
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.440]   And what I love about the permanent portfolio is it seems to me that it solves, especially
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:11.440]   with the heavy allocation towards gold and cash, it solves my fears, right?
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:17.640]   If I know that I've got $250,000 in gold in my vault in Austria and I can go pick this
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.520]   up whenever I want, I just go to Austria and they start giving me gold and I can turn that
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.000]   into euros and go and spend it or take it and put it in the bank and have that bank
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.720]   account pay my credit card, that makes me feel nice in a way that makes me willing to
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.840]   put up with other things in a different way.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:38.760]   And then when I look at cash and I say, "Hey, I can hold some of this cash digitally.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.800]   I can hold some of this cash physically and I can distribute my cash around the world
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.040]   using a basket of currencies," that makes me feel really happy.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.240]   And then I just, because I don't have to worry about my investing, I can just go on and focus
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.000]   on keeping on making money.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.960]   And so I'm not saying, I think almost any of the portfolios can work if you understand
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.580]   them and you believe in them and they click for you.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.480]   And so in general, most people are going to have something that they read about and they
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.480]   say, "You know what?
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   That works for me."
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.080]   It's not a Wallens, it's VTSAX, right?
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.080]   That's it.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.360]   It works for him and he'll stick with it no matter what and it'll work for him.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.960]   For other people who have other concerns, Harry Brown wasn't convinced that all stocks
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.360]   was the way to go and all American companies is the way to go.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.200]   I'm not convinced of that.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.560]   So you develop something else.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.640]   But when you have a portfolio that you understand, the strategy that you get and that you stick
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.240]   to, in time it should work.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:39.840]   Great, appreciate it.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.840]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:41.840]   Great question, Andrew.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.120]   I appreciate your calling it in.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:49.880]   I'm now going to take two written questions from patrons of the show, patrons who weren't
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:56.080]   able to call in live, one on life insurance and the other on the intersection of minimalism,
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:58.520]   travel and prepping.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.200]   So I'm going to begin with life insurance question.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.440]   The question was written in a slightly of a confusing way, but I'll do my best with
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.440]   it.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440]   So, "Hi, Joshua.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.280]   I won't be able to attend the call today, but I have a question that I've asked several
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.880]   advisors and Googled, but I haven't been able to find the answer to.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.880]   The question is this.
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:18.800]   Why wouldn't I want to title a life insurance policy to a trust, either for my wife or my
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.840]   child from another marriage?
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.160]   Each party is separate."
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.420]   The question is a little bit hard for me to understand what the specific problem is.
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:32.040]   So what I'll do is to answer Kevin's question, just very simply give you a quick snapshot
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:37.400]   of life insurance titling, of the way that it works and the way to set a policy up properly
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.460]   for yourself.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:42.800]   Always remember with life insurance contract, there are four parties that are involved in
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.940]   the contract.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:47.840]   The parties that are involved are number one, the owner of the contract.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:53.740]   The owner of a contract is the individual that has all of the rights of the contract.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.740]   The second party involved is the insured.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:02.740]   This is the person on whose life the contract is dependent for its functioning.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:06.740]   The third party is the payer of the contract.
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:09.320]   Usually this would be the owner, but it doesn't have to be.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.560]   And then the fourth party is the beneficiary of the contract.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.860]   And so who is it that receives the money when the insured dies?
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.560]   Those are the four parties in a life insurance contract.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:26.100]   Now all those four parties can be the same person.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:30.460]   So I can own a life insurance, be the owner of the policy.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:35.100]   I can own a life insurance policy on my life, I'm the insured.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:40.100]   I can also pay the premiums for that policy, I'm the payer.
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:49.260]   And I can have myself or more properly my estate be the beneficiary of that policy.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:54.100]   However, additionally, I can change those four things to be anyone else.
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:59.100]   So I can own a policy on my life that I can pay the premiums for,
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:04.100]   but I can make my wife the beneficiary of the policy.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:09.100]   Or my wife can own a policy on my life that she pays for,
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.100]   that she is the beneficiary of that policy.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:16.100]   It's also important to remember that you don't have to have a natural person
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:20.100]   be these individuals involved in a life insurance contract.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:25.100]   So I can establish, or the estate is a good example.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.100]   My estate is not a natural person.
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:32.100]   My estate is an entity, it's kind of like a trust, it's an estate, it's kind of like a trust.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:36.100]   I can set up a life insurance trust that owns my policy,
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:41.100]   and that life insurance trust can pay for that policy on my life.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:46.100]   And then a trust that I've established, that same life insurance trust or a different trust,
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:50.100]   can be the beneficiary of the policy.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:56.100]   A company can own a life insurance policy, can pay the premiums on that policy,
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:00.100]   and can be the beneficiary of a policy, just like a natural person.
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:04.100]   The only person that's always going to be a natural person in a life insurance contract
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.100]   is going to be the insured.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.100]   Now there are limitations as to what entities can take out a life insurance policy on a person.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:15.100]   There has to be what an insurance company would call insurable interest.
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So you, as my listener that I don't know, I can't go to an insurance company and say,
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:25.100]   "Hey, listen, insurance company, I want to take out a policy on Joe Smith's life,
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.100]   and I'll pay for it, and I want to be the beneficiary of it."
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:32.100]   The insurance company says, "Well, what insurable interest is there?
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.100]   How are you harmed if Joe Smith dies?"
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.100]   I say, "Well, you're just a listener."
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:38.100]   "Well, you're not harmed."
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:41.100]   Now if, on the other hand, you were an investor in my company,
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.100]   and you put a lot of money into my company,
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.100]   I could now go to the insurance company and say,
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.100]   "I want to take out a life insurance policy on Joe's life because he's my number one investor,
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:53.100]   and if Joe dies, I'm really going to be hurt because we're going to run out of investment funds."
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.100]   Now I could probably get an insurance policy on your life.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.100]   So that's a quick background on who's involved.
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:03.100]   So what's the best way to own a life insurance contract?
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.100]   Well, it depends on the situation.
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.100]   So first of all, who needs to have the policy rights?
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:16.100]   In general, most of us will find that it's easiest if we own our own policies on our own life.
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:20.100]   That's not necessarily the best, but it is the easiest.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:25.100]   So if I take out a policy on my life, I can do that for any reason at any time.
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:31.100]   If I want to take out a policy on my wife's life, now, of course, I need her consent.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.100]   She has to consent to my taking it out.
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:36.100]   And now I'm in a situation where I'm going to own the policy,
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:41.100]   thus I can sell the policy, I can borrow against the policy, I can cancel the policy,
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.100]   I can do anything I want with the policy, I can transfer the policy,
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:49.100]   but she doesn't have any rights in that contract anymore because she's simply the insured.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.100]   So why would different people own a policy?
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.100]   Well, the first thing you can think about is protection.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   Let's say, for example, that I own a policy on my life for a million dollars,
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.100]   and now my wife is the beneficiary, right?
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.100]   That's why I bought the policy.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.100]   But pretend that my wife and I divorce.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:12.100]   Well, my wife doesn't own a policy on my life,
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:18.100]   and it may be that the divorce court requires me to pay her payments of some kind for her support
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:21.100]   or for child support, et cetera,
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   but she's not going to have that insurance policy that guarantees that.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:29.100]   Now, often as part of a decree, a divorce decree,
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:33.100]   the judge will require somebody to get a life insurance policy,
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:39.100]   but it would protect my wife more if, instead of me owning the million-dollar policy on my life,
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:44.100]   it would protect her more if she owned the million-dollar policy on my life,
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:48.100]   because if she owns a million-dollar policy on my life and then we divorce,
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.100]   I can't force her to do anything with that contract.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:56.100]   She still owns it, so she can still be the beneficiary of that contract no matter what happens.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:01.100]   And so that's safer for her because once the policy is hers, it's hers.
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:06.100]   She can't change it. Now, she's got to pay it, but I can't force her to cancel the contract.
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:11.100]   The only thing I can do as the insurer to the contract is simply to either live or die. That's it.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:16.100]   And if she can prove that I'm alive or dead, the policy will work as it exists.
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:22.100]   So in general, from a safety perspective, it's often best for people to own a policy on the other person's life.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:30.100]   So I've often recommended to husbands and wives that each of them own the policy on the other person's life to protect them.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:36.100]   Depending on the state, you can go a little bit farther with this in terms of the source of funds
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.100]   and should it be a joint bank account or an individual bank account.
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:44.100]   Generally, that stuff is not so important in terms of practice,
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.100]   but it is theoretically important in some situations.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:52.100]   Now, remember, this also needs to be considered in terms of asset protection,
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:56.100]   because one of the things we do want to do is if we're going to get a life insurance policy,
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:02.100]   especially if it's got any kind of cash value in it, we want to make sure that it has in it,
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.100]   that those assets inside the policy are protected.
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.100]   So that's important as well.
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:11.100]   Now, back to the trust that's involved.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:17.100]   Is it a good idea for you to have a life insurance trust on a policy?
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:24.100]   It can be. There's not really any reason not to do it, except the expense of establishing the trust.
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:27.100]   Why does somebody set up a life insurance trust?
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:34.100]   Well, generally, the normal reason for establishing a life insurance trust is for estate tax planning.
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:43.100]   In the United States, when you die, the face amount of all of the life insurance policies that you own
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.100]   is included in your gross estate.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:56.100]   Pretend that I have $10 million of assets, plus I own $10 million of life insurance policies on my life.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:03.100]   When I die, my wife would -- let's use someone other than my wife so we can ignore the spousal exclusion.
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:07.100]   My father would inherit, when I die, he's the beneficiary of my policies,
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:15.100]   he would get $10 million income tax free, because the proceeds from a life insurance policy are received income tax free.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:23.100]   But my estate would include the $10 million of life insurance that I owned,
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.100]   in addition to the $10 million of other assets that I own.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:34.100]   And in the United States, with the current $11.5 million estate tax exemption amounts,
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:40.100]   that means that, assuming I'm not married and I'm not using the spousal exemption amounts together,
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:48.100]   that would mean that now about $9 million of my estate is going to be subject to estate taxes, which are very expensive.
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:55.100]   Well, that could have been avoided very simply if I had not owned that life insurance policy at the date of my death.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:00.100]   If I had simply established an irrevocable life insurance trust,
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:08.100]   and then I had transferred money into that trust for that trust to buy a life insurance policy on my life,
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:13.100]   now when I die, the only asset that I own is my $10 million of assets.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.100]   I don't own the life insurance policy.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:19.100]   And what would happen is the trust owns the life insurance policy,
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:24.100]   the trust then simply takes, when I die, the policy is exercised,
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   and the policy premiums go to the beneficiary of the policy,
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:32.100]   which is just paid out according to the trust documents, or goes directly to my dad.
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:35.100]   And so my dad receives the money income tax free.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:38.100]   Now, the reason why trusts are really great thing,
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:42.100]   life insurance policies are really great things for trusts to own,
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:48.100]   is that the inside buildup of cash values inside of a life insurance policy are not taxed.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.100]   So thus they are not subject in the United States,
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:59.100]   there are not subject to the heavy trust income tax rates for a trust such that would generally hold another asset.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.100]   So the trust holds an asset that's creating income,
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.100]   the trust now has to pay income tax rates at the highest marginal brackets.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.100]   Whereas if the trust owns life insurance policy,
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:11.100]   any income that's growing in that, or any cash values that are growing in that policy,
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.100]   are not subject to income tax.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.100]   And then when the policy is exercised,
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.100]   because the proceeds of a life insurance policy are not subject to income tax,
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.100]   then still the trust is avoiding the insurance taxes,
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:27.100]   sorry, the income taxes on that death benefit.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.100]   So this is why trusts are really good things to hold a life insurance contract.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.100]   So if that's what you're talking about in this question,
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:37.100]   is there any reason not for my trust not to own a life insurance policy?
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.100]   Well, no, the only problem is do you need it, right?
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   Most people don't have $20 million estates,
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:46.100]   most people are not, especially now that we've got $11.5 million estate tax exemption,
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.100]   most people are not in that situation.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:53.100]   Now, 15, 20 years ago when the estate taxes were at $750,000 and above,
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:57.100]   then almost any millionaire needed a life insurance trust owning a life insurance policy.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.100]   But at the moment, very few people do.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:03.100]   It's only a very small number of estates that will be subject to estate taxes.
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.100]   So that would be one thing.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:08.100]   Now, should you want, the question is,
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:13.100]   why wouldn't I want to title a life insurance policy to a trust for my wife or child from another marriage?
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:18.100]   I don't think in this situation that you necessarily have to have a trust.
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.100]   So when people have blended families,
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.100]   and they have children from one marriage,
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:24.100]   and then they're remarried,
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:32.100]   usually the biggest financial planning problem here is how do we make sure that certain assets go to certain people?
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:38.100]   And so frequently if you have a husband and a wife who have children from a first marriage,
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:40.100]   then they've divorced and they've married again,
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:45.100]   usually the husband will want to make sure that his assets go to the children from his first marriage.
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:50.100]   The wife will often want to make sure that her assets go to the children from her first marriage, etc.
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:43:00.100]   And a lot of times it would be frustrating and really problematic for the children who are in a, you know,
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   if people are being disinherited basically.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:07.100]   This becomes difficult, especially when you have assets that are not necessarily liquid.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:13.100]   Let's say that husband and wife in their second marriage have a great big house,
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:17.100]   and that great big house is going to be passed along to one person that needs it.
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:19.100]   What about the other children?
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:27.100]   So life insurance is one of the great functions that life insurance can form is as an estate equalization tool.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.100]   Let's assume I have two children.
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:33.100]   I have a half a million dollar house and no other meaningful assets except a life insurance policy.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.100]   Well, one of my children wants the house.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:36.100]   They want the lake house.
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:40.100]   So I can just simply leave the lake house to that child number one,
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:44.100]   and then I have a $500,000 life insurance policy that goes to child number two.
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:45.100]   Now everyone's happy.
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.100]   Child number one inherits a $500,000 house.
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:51.100]   The house gets a step up in tax basis at the date of my death, so they get a house tax free.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.100]   They can live in it.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:55.100]   It's got a $500,000 tax basis starting with them.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.100]   Second child gets $500,000 of cash.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.100]   They're happy.
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.100]   They have no taxes due on it.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:02.100]   They just simply now I've equalized my estate.
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:06.100]   Life insurance really works really well at performing that function.
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:12.100]   Life insurance also has the benefit of flowing according to beneficiary status.
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:16.100]   So life insurances are not ordered by your will.
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:22.100]   Your will can deal with other assets that you may own, but a life insurance policy is independent of that.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:28.100]   So if parents just simply want to make sure that their children from a first marriage get a certain amount of money,
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.100]   yeah, you can just simply take out a life insurance policy,
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:36.100]   establish the child as the beneficiary of that policy, and then when you die, it goes to them.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:38.100]   It's one of the simplest tools.
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.100]   The only problem with life insurance is that you've got to pay premiums,
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.100]   and that when you're doing this kind of planning,
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:50.100]   it's going to have to be some form of permanent life insurance policy that is guaranteed to be around at the date of your death.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:54.100]   And so generally your premiums are thousands or tens of thousands of dollars,
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:58.100]   not hundreds or a few thousand dollars as they are with term life insurance policies,
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.100]   which are just for temporary life insurance protection.
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:07.100]   So is there any reason not to title a life insurance policy to a trust?
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:12.100]   There's no reason that I can see other than simply the costs of establishing the trust,
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:19.100]   the hassle of funding it, the hassle of making sure the trustee sends out the crummy notices every year, etc.,
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:24.100]   so that you can properly have that life insurance trust function properly.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:26.100]   And I just don't think it's probably not necessary.
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:29.100]   If you want to buy a life insurance policy on your life,
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:36.100]   and you want to make your child from your first marriage a beneficiary of that, you can do that.
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:38.100]   Your wife can't stop you from doing that.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.100]   Your wife can't change the beneficiary.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:44.100]   Your wife has no control over the policy unless she's the owner of the policy.
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:49.100]   If you want to have one policy that your wife owns on your life that she's the beneficiary of that you just pay,
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:54.100]   and that protects her, and then you want to have a second policy that you own, that you pay for,
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:57.100]   that goes for your child, you can do that.
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:00.100]   And so you probably don't need a trust.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:06.100]   I guess the only thing I can think of that the additional benefit sometimes of a life insurance trust would be creditor protection,
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:07.100]   asset protection.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:11.100]   With that kind of irrevocable life insurance trust, you don't own it.
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:14.100]   So thus it's an asset that can never be attached by your creditors.
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:17.100]   It's an irrevocable trust that simply owns a life insurance policy.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   Now, you may be making annual contributions to the trust every year,
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.100]   so therefore you are putting money into it.
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:27.100]   But if you can't put the money in it sometimes because your money is being seized,
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:32.100]   then in general that's the trustee who will have to figure out how to adjust the policy.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:37.100]   They may have to take a reduced policy paid up with a reduced amount of insurance, something like that.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:40.100]   But they can figure that out with the policy that's in the trust.
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:43.100]   So if you were thinking about this from an asset protection standpoint,
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:50.100]   and you absolutely wanted a guarantee no matter what that you have a life insurance policy that goes to your child,
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:54.100]   then I think maybe the life insurance trust adds a little bit of additional protection.
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:47:01.100]   You buy a $5 million policy in the trust, you make your transfers to it of $15,000, $20,000 per year for your premiums,
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:06.100]   up to $15,000 per year under the gift tax exclusion amounts.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.100]   It works pretty well. It works pretty simply.
[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:10.100]   And once the money is in the trust, once the crummy notices are sent,
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:14.100]   so that the child has the right of withdrawal from the trust, the money stays in there.
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:19.100]   When you die, that trust will pay out the life insurance proceeds to your child.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:22.100]   And in fact, you of course should set up a spendthrift trust to be the beneficiary of it
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:26.100]   so that your child gets the additional savings as well.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:32.100]   So that all that money is protected from their potential creditors or their potential divorces, etc.
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:34.100]   So reasons why you wouldn't want to do it? No, it's great.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:37.100]   It's complex. It's a hassle. You got to hire an attorney to set it up.
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:39.100]   There's costs to it.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:43.100]   But in terms of financial planning reasons, not a bad idea at all.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:49.100]   Final question of the day. I will balance today out with finish it up with kind of a light and fun one.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.100]   Andy writes in and says, "Joshua, I won't be able to call in today,
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:57.100]   but I was wondering your thoughts on balancing minimalism versus prepping.
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:00.100]   You teach storing food and water and equipment,
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:04.100]   but I figure that RVing and going international have given you good opportunity
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:08.100]   to practice pairing down to the minimum, and I'd like to hear your experiences.
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:12.100]   My wife tends more towards minimalism, and I tend more toward prepping.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   So that leads us into a bit of disagreement when I want to store crates of food, water, and backup gear,
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:21.100]   and she doesn't. Thanks, Andy." Andy, you are right.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:25.100]   I moved my family, four children, two dogs, etc.
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:28.100]   I moved around the world with fewer than a dozen suitcases.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:32.100]   So I can teach you all you want about water storage, but I guarantee you this.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.100]   I did not move with stored water.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:40.100]   So first of all, let's talk about the philosophy of minimalism.
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.100]   There are different people who have different approaches to minimalism,
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.100]   and here's how I analyze it.
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:50.100]   In a way, I consider myself a minimalist, but not in the way that it's often presented.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:55.100]   The way that a minimalist will often present their case is that happiness or nirvana
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:49:00.100]   or something is found in having the smallest number of possessions.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:03.100]   I don't know if this is still popular, but a number of years ago,
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:07.100]   it was very popular for someone to say, "I only own 100 things."
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.100]   And there were people who travel in a carry-on suitcase,
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:13.100]   and everything they own fits in their suitcase.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:16.100]   I respect that, right? I admire that. That's cool.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:20.100]   I can fully see how that makes you very mobile to not have much stuff.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:25.100]   And I like not having much stuff in that situation.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:30.100]   There's another kind of expression of minimalism, which perhaps a word might be
[01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:35.100]   just kind of a non-cluttered aesthetic.
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:38.100]   You walk into a house, and the house just has a few things in it.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:42.100]   It's not cluttered with knick-knacks and tchotchkes and random stuff strewn about
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:47.100]   and shot glasses from Cancun and pewter spoons and things like that.
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:53.100]   There's an aesthetic of bare walls and a few pieces of artwork
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.100]   and a few pieces of furniture, etc.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:50:00.100]   But here, we're not just trying to work towards some arbitrary tiny number.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:04.100]   I admire that, and frankly, my wife and I both have that bent.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.100]   Neither of us likes clutter.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.100]   For example, I like my kitchen counters to be totally clear.
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:08.100]   I don't want anything on the kitchen counter.
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.100]   I don't want a coffee maker. I don't want a toaster.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.100]   I want to get to the end of doing the dishes and see the counters clear.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:15.100]   I don't always do it.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:19.100]   Sometimes I have the coffee maker out and the water to tea kettle for a little while,
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:22.100]   but I don't like--growing up, my mom loved gadgets,
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:25.100]   and so her kitchen is just packed full of gadgets.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.100]   I don't like it. My wife doesn't like it either,
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:29.100]   so thankfully, we try to keep our counters clear.
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.100]   Now, in a way, that's kind of minimalism.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.100]   And if you go through and you khanmar your drawers
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:39.100]   and you just have the things that you really need or the things that spark joy,
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.100]   you can do that as well.
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.100]   I don't like to have a bunch of stuff stuffed in a drawer as well.
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:47.100]   So in that degree, I also consider myself a minimalist.
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.100]   Where I think the difference is, though,
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:54.100]   is having things that are not useful to you or that you don't love.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.100]   That's one thing.
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:59.100]   And then the second thing is having things that are poorly organized.
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:03.100]   There's a big difference between having things that you need
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:07.100]   or that might be useful to you and having things that are poorly organized.
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:11.100]   Now, I've been at both extremes, and I don't think there's one right answer,
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:16.100]   but I believe there's value in having things that you need or that you might need.
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:19.100]   And in fact, there's financial value in it as well.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.100]   There is a tradeoff.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:23.100]   You could have so many things that you can't move easily.
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:24.100]   For example, preppers.
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:28.100]   Preppers are often known for stockpiling tons and tons of gear.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.100]   And I read stories about hardcore preppers moving,
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.100]   and some of them have to have a semi-truck.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.100]   And that's true.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:41.100]   If you've got 50,000 rounds of 5.56, and you've got boxes and boxes of toilet paper
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:44.100]   and long-term storage food and buckets everywhere,
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.100]   you've got to rent a semi-truck, certainly.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:50.100]   So it's harder for you to move than just simply getting in the car and going.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.100]   And I think there's a lot of benefit in keeping things light.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:52:01.100]   I have a good friend of mine listening to the show who seems to have established the habit of moving across the country regularly,
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:04.100]   but he practices what he calls the low-drag lifestyle.
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:07.100]   When he moves across the country, he doesn't get a U-Haul truck.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:12.100]   He gets rid of all the stuff except what fits in a small or a mid-sized sedan,
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:15.100]   and then he and his wife get in the sedan and they drive.
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:20.100]   And then when they get to their new location, they go ahead and buy the new things they need and live very lightly.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.100]   And I did the calculations, the math on that, and I'm convinced that it's not necessarily stupid.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:29.100]   It allows you to move into any apartment. It allows you to move into any house.
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:32.100]   You just don't have a lot of stuff. You buy fresh the stuff that you need.
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:35.100]   And they're fairly minimalist. They don't stock the house full of tons of stuff.
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:38.100]   They just keep the basic things.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:45.100]   But if you see value in having reserves, you kind of got to put those reserves somewhere.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:50.100]   So, you know, I have four children.
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:57.100]   If my children have no clean water, we're forced to go and drink out of a dirty municipal supply,
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:03.100]   they're going to develop dysentery or have diarrhea, and they're going to die.
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:08.100]   One of the major causes of death all around the world is contaminated water that causes people to become sick.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.100]   And this happens after a disaster zone.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:15.100]   So what kind of father am I if there's an earthquake at my house or a hurricane at my house,
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:20.100]   and now I don't have any water to feed my children, and so I give them contaminated water,
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:23.100]   and they die from dehydration and dysentery?
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.100]   That's unacceptable.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:32.100]   That is absolutely unacceptable for me as a father to, when something is so easily solved
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:37.100]   and so easily provided for, it's unacceptable for me to take that kind of risk.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:43.100]   Now, I understand if a father is in the middle of, you know, he lives in Port-au-Prince and makes a dollar a day,
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.100]   then he may not have the ability to do that, but that's not me.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:48.100]   I don't live in Port-au-Prince, and I don't make a dollar a day.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:53.100]   So when I have little people who are dependent upon me for their life,
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:57.100]   and I know that they need clean water, I better make sure that they have clean water.
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   Now, when clean water is so simple to have, you know, some flats of water bottles,
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:11.100]   some buckets of water, some barrels of water, a water filter, depending on how much space I have,
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.100]   then it will be unto me if I don't take care of something that's so simple.
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:18.100]   Same thing with food.
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:25.100]   How could I, as a father, how could I be so irresponsible to make sure that when we live in a world of abundant food,
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:32.100]   and I have abundant money to buy food, that I don't make sure that I take care of my children with their food?
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:36.100]   That's simply irresponsible to not do that.
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:42.100]   Now, does that mean that I have to have massive, massive amounts of supplies?
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.100]   Probably not, not necessarily.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.100]   But is it a bad thing to have supplies?
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.100]   Here's my theory on stuff.
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:54.100]   Stuff is a drain if it's poorly organized and you don't know what you have.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:58.100]   But stuff in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:02.100]   So, to give you an example, the way that I like to store things, I try to keep everything in modules.
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:04.100]   That works for me.
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:10.100]   So, whenever I have something that's a module, whether if I buy a, you know, I have my podcasting module, right?
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.100]   I've got my equipment.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:17.100]   And all of my podcasting equipment goes in one bag, and that bag has all of my gear.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:25.100]   It's got my cables, it's got my microphones, it's got my recorders, it's got my extra stuff, it's got my batteries, my battery chargers.
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:27.100]   Everything's in one bag.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:30.100]   I know that bag has all my podcasting equipment.
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:32.100]   It's a complete kit.
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:44.100]   It's not burdensome to me to have one bag of stuff that's all fitting together, that's sitting on a shelf, that says, and it's clearly labeled, "Podcasting Kit."
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.100]   When I travel, I grab the kit, I put it in.
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:50.100]   When I make a podcast, I take everything out, I put it on the table, and I put it away.
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.100]   Everything is in a kit.
[01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:55.100]   So, that thing is basically one item.
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.100]   It's not multiple items.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:01.100]   So, it's not--I'm not conflicting with minimalism.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:04.100]   And to me, the same thing applies to really everything else.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:07.100]   If I have a phone, I'm going to have the accessories for my phone.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.100]   So, it all goes in one bag.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.100]   I've got the chargers, which is what I do with my phones.
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:13.100]   I've got a wall charger.
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.100]   I've got a car charger.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.100]   I've got a Faraday bag.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.100]   I've got the little clippy thing that I use when I'm filming videos.
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.100]   I've got the selfie stick or whatever it is that I'm going to use.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.100]   I've got the headphones.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:24.100]   Everything's in one bag.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:25.100]   That's cell phone accessories.
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:26.100]   It all stays there.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:28.100]   Extra batteries, extra cables, whatever it is.
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:29.100]   It's a kit.
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:32.100]   So, that way, I don't have junk everywhere just sitting in a drawer.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.100]   I've got a kit.
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:37.100]   And then when you go up beyond there, I like to use Rubbermaid bins.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:42.100]   And so, what I've always done is I've had multiple shelving units, and I put the shelving unit somewhere.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.100]   I have a Rubbermaid bin.
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:46.100]   This Rubbermaid bin has sports equipment.
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:47.100]   So, I pull it out.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:51.100]   There's the sports equipment, and everything is segmented into little modules and kits.
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:56.100]   I don't find that somehow I'm emotionally drained because I'm not a minimalist anymore.
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:57.100]   I've got sports equipment.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:00.100]   If I like playing sports, then I'm going to have sports equipment.
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:06.100]   The key is to have it organized so that it's not overwhelming to you and it's not overflowing everywhere.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:11.100]   And so, by that standard, I don't think there's any point to minimalism.
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:14.100]   Like, having less stuff doesn't help you.
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:16.100]   I'll give you this just with children.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   I had for years, I always had this idea.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:23.100]   I want my children to be the kind of children that can be happy with nothing,
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.100]   that can be happy playing no matter where they are with whatever they've got.
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:30.100]   And then we went RVing, and they just had one little box of toys each.
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:34.100]   And so, they only had a little bit, and I achieved my goal.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:37.100]   My children learned how to play in the dirt with a rock and a stick.
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:38.100]   I was happy with that.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:40.100]   But here's what I learned.
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:43.100]   I learned that I didn't know what I was talking about before I had children.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:48.100]   Yes, my children could play with a rock and a stick, but they also came back to me every five minutes
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.100]   and asked, "Daddy, this, this, let's do this, this, this, this."
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:53.100]   And I couldn't get anything done because they're showing up every five minutes
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:55.100]   because they didn't have enough toys.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:58.100]   Well, then, once I could, I got them more toys,
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.100]   so we're not as minimalist in the number of toys as we once had.
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:04.100]   But now, they don't come back every five minutes saying, "Daddy, Daddy, do this, this, this."
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:09.100]   So, I needed more toys, needed more books, and needed the stuff.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:12.100]   So, there's nothing ideal about having less stuff.
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:15.100]   You just want to have the appropriate amount of stuff,
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:18.100]   the ideal amount of stuff for what you need.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.100]   So, yes, I have learned to pare down to a minimum.
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:25.100]   I moved with, again, under a dozen suitcases, less than that.
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:29.100]   I can't remember the exact number, but I moved the country with a dozen suitcases.
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:32.100]   So, I didn't bring a whole bunch of prepping gear.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:37.100]   But once I got established in a new house, okay, what are the needs of my family going to be?
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:40.100]   How do I make sure that I have backups and reserves?
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:41.100]   The power is still going to go out.
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:42.100]   The water is still going to go out.
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.100]   I might run out of food.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:46.100]   It's not that hard to have a few reserves.
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:49.100]   So, you look around in your local area, and it's as simple as saying,
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:52.100]   "Hey, let's get a little bit of extra rice and beans," right?
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:55.100]   Or, "Let's go ahead and buy a little bit more canned chicken."
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:58.100]   "Let's go ahead and make sure I have a water filter."
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.100]   You can get a water filter in any place in the world.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.100]   "Let's go ahead and make sure that I have some buckets of water."
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:05.100]   "Well, here's some water containers. I'll get this water container. I'll get that water container."
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.100]   "I'm going to make sure I have that."
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:10.100]   "Let me make sure that I put aside a couple of cans of gasoline."
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:14.100]   I'm not a doomsday prepper. I don't have an 18-wheeler.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.100]   I don't do that. I keep all that stuff in my bunker.
[01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:18.100]   Kidding.
[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:20.100]   I want you to think I'm kidding anyway.
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:24.100]   So, the point is that you expand to it.
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.100]   But if it annoys your wife to have the stuff,
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:30.100]   then make sure it's well organized, and then consider dispersing it in another place.
[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:35.100]   So, one of the big mistakes that a lot of people have is they have the stuff that overwhelms their house.
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.100]   But is it really?
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:39.100]   Your wife's a minimalist.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:48.100]   Is it really going to bother her psychologically if you have cases of water bottles under the bed in the spare bedroom instead of empty space?
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:51.100]   If so, find another place for the water bottles.
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.100]   But there's a balance here.
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.100]   The problem with the guy who lives with a hundred things, right?
[01:59:55.100 --> 02:00:00.100]   Colin. I used to read a blog by Colin someone or other who would do this thing.
[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:06.100]   The problem with that is he can take care of himself.
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:10.100]   And certainly he can be in situations where he may or may not have what he needs.
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:11.100]   He's probably going to be okay.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:15.100]   But if he had children, that's just irresponsible.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.100]   You can't do it. You've got to have food.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.100]   They start screaming if you don't feed them.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:23.100]   So, there's a right balance.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:26.100]   Many preppers do go to the extreme.
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:31.100]   I'm not trying to advocate for people to live for ten years on their own through the zombie apocalypse.
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:33.100]   I think it's cool if you want to do it.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.100]   I enjoy the intellectual exercise.
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.100]   But that's probably unnecessary.
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:41.100]   It's hard to imagine the need to be able to be self-sufficient for ten years.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:44.100]   But three months?
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:47.100]   So, if it's bothering your wife, I say keep it somewhere else.
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:51.100]   One of the simplest things I would recommend is having a trailer.
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:56.100]   Having a cargo trailer and storing some of your things in the cargo trailer.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.100]   So, that way it's out of your house.
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:58.100]   But it's mobile if you need it.
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:00:59.100]   So, you can do that with a camper.
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:01.100]   You may do that with a storage unit.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:06.100]   Another thing is make sure that when you are having things that you're careful and you're thoughtful.
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:10.100]   One of the things that I don't get is so many preppers especially,
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:13.100]   they wind up having things that don't complement one another.
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:17.100]   There's one guy that I like his stuff, but he's addicted to flashlights.
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.100]   He's got dozens and dozens of flashlights.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:22.100]   I don't see the point of having a dozen flashlights.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:28.100]   I see the point of having a headlamp, a flashlight, and a lantern.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:32.100]   Because they're all three different sources of light that are redundant.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:35.100]   So, you have backups, but they complement one another.
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:40.100]   I'd rather have a headlamp, a flashlight, and a lantern than three flashlights.
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.100]   Three flashlights starts to feel like a bunch of junk,
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:45.100]   but a headlight, a flashlight, and a lantern don't.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:48.100]   And so, with everything, that's always been my approach.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:53.100]   How do I have redundancy, complementary redundancy that's thoughtful and intelligent
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:55.100]   and then make sure it's streamlined.
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:02.100]   I do think preppers tend to go through a phase where in the beginning,
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:05.100]   it's got a few things and it's all about the stuff.
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:09.100]   And then over time, people recognize, you know what, I don't need this much stuff.
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:12.100]   Give me an example. Let's say toilet paper.
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:17.100]   The thing that most of us don't appreciate until it's gone.
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:21.100]   Well, toilet paper is something that can take up a lot of space.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:26.100]   So, if you're trying to have two years worth of toilet paper, that might annoy your wife.
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:30.100]   But if you look at it and say, all right, maybe I have a little bit of extra toilet paper,
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:33.100]   but instead what I'll do is because I don't want to have too much stuff,
[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:37.100]   what I'll do is recognize that I'm probably never going to need two years worth of toilet paper.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.100]   So, let me have some toilet paper.
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.100]   Let me pack and store some baby wipes.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:45.100]   And then let me have some cloths that we can use for cloth toilet paper,
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:48.100]   which is reusable and can be washable if we ever needed it.
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:53.100]   It's going to be much more effective and much more cost and much more space efficient.
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.100]   So, that's my answer is store the crates of food,
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:03:00.100]   store the water in a place where it's not particularly frustrating and annoying.
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:02.100]   Don't put them in the living room.
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:04.100]   Put them in a shed out back. Put them in a cargo trailer in the backyard.
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:07.100]   Put them in a storage unit nearby.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.100]   But make sure that you have the stuff that you need.
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:14.100]   And in time, you'll start to get better and better.
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:17.100]   There may ultimately be some trade-off.
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:22.100]   For example, if you have too much junk, too many prepping supplies, etc.,
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:24.100]   you may not be able to live in a small apartment.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:28.100]   And some people buy big houses and big farms just to store their stuff.
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:31.100]   Calculate the cost. Calculate the benefits yourself.
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:34.100]   But it's probably not necessary to go to that extreme.
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:38.100]   And so, keep the benefits of your minimal flexible lifestyle.
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:40.100]   But as you become more skilled,
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:45.100]   you'll recognize that you can probably get by with less stuff and still perform all of the same functions.
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:48.100]   Those are my thoughts. Thank you for calling in for a Friday Q&A show.
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:50.100]   Today was mammoth, 2 hours and 4 minutes.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:53.100]   Thank you for listening. I hope you've enjoyed these questions.
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.100]   I just remind you, give me your thoughts.

[02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:01.100]   I'd love to know your thoughts on hosting an in-person group.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:06.100]   Again, something like a 3-day seminar, maybe something around February 2020,
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:12.100]   is basically the idea and price point of basically, I would guess, a few thousand dollars,
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:17.100]   $200,000 to $3,000 all inclusive for a 3-day seminar, networking, and maximum,
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:20.100]   like small event, 50 to 60 people maximum.
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:22.100]   Send me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:26.100]   Have a great weekend, and I will be with you very soon.
