There is a growing, I don't know that it's having a big impact yet, but there's a growing movement for it.

[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:03.260]   we're going to keep doing, we're going to set up a little trailer or buy a bunkhouse or whatever your dad needs for a shop that he can use for his stained glass projects.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:08.260]   And we're going to live in the RV and we're going to go north in the summer and south in the winter.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:12.260]   And then what we'll do is we will subdivide the house, sell off the lot.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:18.260]   We'll rent out our primary house for a rental income so that, so that we keep that house in case we want to move back to it.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:24.260]   And we'll rent that one out and then we'll use the money for a second house as a down payment on another rental house.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:24.320]   And we'll try to get to the point where we have one or two houses that we can rent out.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:24.320]   And we'll rent that one out and then we'll use the money for a second house as a down payment on another rental house.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:52.420]  ,ï¿½, and we'll try to get to the point where we have one or two rental houses and then our work camping provides for most of our living expenses and we make it up with the additional stained glass income as well.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:52.420]   A couple who's living on the road frugally can live on the road really at any budget.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.360]   People can do it on less than a thousand dollars a month, but many times people will do it on a few thousand dollars a month.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   It's very reasonable, a couple to three thousand dollars a month.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   So maybe something like that would be a lifestyle they would really be excited about.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:48:00.400]   And in terms of the finances, the most important thing is that your parents not take Social Security until 70.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:09.400]   They want to stretch out their Social Security as much as possible so that Social Security benefit is as high as possible, which means they've got to have a transition plan right now for the next ten years.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.400]   And they've got to have a transition plan that doesn't make them feel like, ï¿½We're just hating life and we're suffering.ï¿½
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   So that's where I come to say, ï¿½What would you like to do?ï¿½
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   And so if you can make the transition plan with a lifestyle that they would be encouraged by, with seasonal employment, social security, and a lifestyle that they would be encouraged by, then that's going to be a very good transition plan.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   And so I'm going to say that's a very good transition plan.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   And so I'm going to say that's a very good transition plan.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:54.440]  , and I'm going to say that's a very good transition plan.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   And so I'm going to say that's a very good transition plan.

[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:35.940]   then when they come back during the wintertime, they can come back to their home, their own house, but they have a tenant in the house and they just live on the second property in their RV. Something like that could work for as well.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:43.400]   You know, as many times as I've heard you talk about RVing, that never occurred to me and that's a really good idea.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:51.600]   It's fantastic. If you go to, first of all, I love RVing. I have a wanderlust bone in my body. Every bone in my body has a wanderlust.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   But I love RVing.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:50:20.180]  , and if you go and you,
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.180]   if you go and you talk to work campers for people in this phase of life, it is one of the best situations for them. Nobody gets rich doing it. They're not going to get rich, but what they can do is they can defray their living expenses. They've got to have some money and some income, which I think is where a rental house would be helpful and then having some savings. They've got to have savings as well because they've got to buy a rig. They've got to take care of it. But the work campers, they'll often work something like a week on, week off, but the work is right outside the door of their RV.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.180]   So, I think it's a good thing to do.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.180]   I think it's a good thing to do.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   And so, I think it's a good thing to do.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   And so, I think it's a good thing to do.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   And so, I think it's a good thing to do.

[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:46.460]   do you work exclusively locally or do you work nationally? I am selling online nationally. Okay. So in that case, then the web serves you very well. Of course, the web can serve you locally as well, but it's just very different if you have a national presence. Tell me about your social media strategy. It's probably lacking, let's be honest. So we are
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:54.540]   performs
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:57:15.360]   tÃ¤ll in the,,,, lying
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:22.600]   thing with our meta description and a link to the blog post.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.540]   I've also started just for the heck of it, putting it on LinkedIn.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.800]   We'll see if anything happens there.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.860]   I don't know if it will, but it's hard to imagine how LinkedIn
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.600]   is going to serve you, uh, or Twitter.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.700]   So I think the biggest thing is what's your strategy.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:39.540]   Well, your strategy is to, is to provide something great that people really love,
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:41.220]   but you've got to get discovered.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.240]   So how do you get discovered?
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.060]   Well, my opinion, social media is going to be your obvious solution here.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.060]   Well, social media is going to be your obvious solution here.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.060]   Well, social media is going to be your obvious solution here.

[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   And so if you look at the communities, there are so many big pages and so many big brands and groups and organized communities of people who specialize in gluten-free that you simply need to focus on being findable there.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   I don't know how to do it specifically.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   I would say Gary Vee's course is the great place to go.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   And absolutely, one of the most important things is to be active in promoting other people's things.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   And so if you look at the communities, there are so many big pages and so many big brands and groups and organized communities of people who specialize in gluten-free that you simply need to focus on being findable there.

[00:58:46.100 --> 00:59:16.120]  , and so in so doing, you start to build friends for yourself in that community to show people
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:16.120]   and so in so doing, you start to build friends for yourself in that community to show people

[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   We're committed and we're part of this community.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   We offer this niche product that you would like.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   I would imagine also that if you do a little searching for education,
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   that there's a lot of education out there for how you can really spread your physical product
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   with other people in the influencer space.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   So whether that means going to gluten-free con or keto con or whatever it is,
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   whatever conference it is and buying a booth there,
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   what you've got to do is you've got to
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   to go to gluten-free con or keto con or whatever it is that whatever conference it is and buying a booth there.

[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.180]   So that's what we're trying to do.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.180]   for the right to be a course etc.

[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:52.780]   Beaumont: How do you feature your customers? So tell me a little bit at this point about what you're doing to feature your customers and there, you know, to get them posting online about what you're doing.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:03:10.980]   Not much. We have we've tried to push them for if people will give us an online review that will show it to us, whatever, that we will give them 10% off. That
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:10.980]   has not

[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:39.940]  , has not It's Frank I've been pushing getting signups on our email list more than doing that. Right. So like there's only you know, only so many things you can yell at someone in person. No question. Yeah, sharing information. What I would do is probably nothing basically. Okay, so the idea is trying to figure out how to profile your customers, right, especially in the Instagram world when everybody loves to everybody loves to show.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:04:06.440]   What they're doing, what they're cooking, etc, especially in the gluten free world. So figure out how to run contests and customer appreciation things on Instagram, all the contests for free bags of brownies, etc. There's there are worlds out there. It's not my thing. So I haven't studied it in detail. But I just watch and I can see what's working by what people are doing. So go and figure out how to do that to engage the people there. And then

[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:29.900]   of the divorce court requires me to pay her payments of some kind for her support or for child support, etc. But she's not going to have that insurance policy that guarantees that. Now, often as part of a decree, a divorce decree, the judge will require somebody to get a life insurance policy.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:29.900]   The judge will require somebody to get a life insurance policy.

[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.300]   Now, she's got a policy.
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:28.540]  . I can't force her to cancel the contract. The only thing I can do is the insurer to the contract is simply to either live or die. That's it. And if she can prove that I'm alive or dead, the policy will work as it exists. So in general, from a safety perspective, it's often best for people to own a policy on the other person's life. So I've often recommended to husbands and wives that each of them own the policy on the other person's life to protect them.

So what kind of father am I if there's an earthquake at my house or a hurricane at my house?

So when I have little people who are dependent upon me for their life and I know that they need clean water, I'd better make sure that they have clean water. Now, when clean water is so simple to have, you know, some flats of water bottles, some buckets of water, some barrels of water, a water filter, depending on how much space I have, then I don't have the ability to do that.

[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:13.040]   You just want to have the appropriate amount of stuff.

[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:18.700]   So yes, I have learned to pare down to a minimum.

[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.780]   Less than that.
