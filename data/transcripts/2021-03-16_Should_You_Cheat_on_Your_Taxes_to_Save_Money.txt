[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.300]   we're gonna talk about this simple question.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.580]   Should you
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.980]   evade your taxes in order to save on taxes?
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.520]   I guess if I were gonna try to use
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.220]   more emotional language, I would say,
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.520]   should you cheat on your taxes
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.300]   in order for you to save money on taxes?
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.660]   Should you simply say, I'm not going to pay.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.020]   No matter what they say I owe,
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.840]   I'm just not going to pay them
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.300]   even though they want money from me,
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.940]   and thus I'm going to save on my taxes.
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.100]   Here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.540]   as we come through tax season in the United States,
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.840]   we're gonna be talking about some new tax planning ideas.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.280]   And this is an idea that,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.140]   while of course no financial planner
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080]   or financial advisor would advise it,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.460]   this is an idea that I think the many people,
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460]   I don't know if the majority,
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.740]   but many people have thought about doing.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.820]   It's simply, well, I'll just not pay them
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.220]   what they say that I owe them.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.700]   I'll just keep my money myself.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.620]   And I wanna talk to you today about that idea.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.540]   Now, I'm not going to make a moral argument for you today.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.760]   And in fact, let me not bury the lead.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.320]   My answer is no, I don't think you should do that.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.260]   I think you should pay the taxes that are required of you.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.300]   But I'm not gonna today moralize about it.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.100]   I'm not gonna make anything other than two
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.900]   very simple practical arguments
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.260]   that I want you to consider as you consider this question.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.380]   Because I think these two practical arguments are powerful
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.300]   and they're persuasive enough, at least for me,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.340]   to make sure that I'm gonna report
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.740]   every dollar of income I make
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.500]   and I'm gonna pay every dollar that they say that I owe.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.760]   And I'll explain why in this particular show.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.740]   Let's begin with reason number one.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.020]   As I see it, the very first most important reason
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.620]   for you to pay what they say that you owe
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.780]   is simply this, to stay out of prison.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.940]   Sounds silly, but it's really true.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.180]   You want to stay out of prison.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.660]   Here at Radical Personal Finance, we're all about freedom.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.020]   Freedom in every sense of the word,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.420]   including financial freedom and all of the other freedoms
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.140]   that financial freedom can help you to enjoy.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140]   But the very cornerstone of freedom,
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.580]   kind of the basic level,
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.900]   the most important things that you need
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.940]   in order to declare yourself free,
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.020]   the minimum viable concept of freedom is this,
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.060]   not be in prison.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.260]   Now, I guess someone like me could come up with a show
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140]   of how to be free in your mind in prison.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.180]   But listen, realistically, if you are in prison,
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.860]   you are not free.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.280]   You are not free to do anything else.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.440]   You're not free to enjoy your money.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   You're not free to do any of the good things of life
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.200]   if you are sitting in prison.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.860]   You're simply not free.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.200]   And so the foundation of freedom is don't go to prison.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.680]   Now, what's the foundation of not going to prison?
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.340]   What are those fundamental concepts
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.800]   that you wanna make sure that you abide by
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.760]   so that you don't go to prison?
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.580]   Well, as I see it, foundational concept number one
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.080]   for you not to go to prison is don't do things
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.180]   that might result in your going to prison.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.080]   That's it.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.760]   If you can just not do things that will result
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.780]   in your not going to prison,
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.840]   you will be in a far better situation.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.640]   Now, I would be quick to be one of those who would add
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.600]   that that might not be enough to consciously not do things
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.320]   that might result in your not going to prison.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.160]   I've done many shows here at Radical Personal Finance
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.200]   about the importance of making sure that no matter what,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.060]   things like you don't talk to the police.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.540]   Experts often estimate that you and I probably commit
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.560]   on average about three felonies a day in the United States.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.000]   We just don't know what they are.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.320]   But there are so many laws
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.560]   that if we had enough information,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.160]   we could hang you up, guaranteed.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   And so you want to make sure that you're careful.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.640]   But don't talk to the police,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   don't answer questions, things like that.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.040]   But the very basic level of entrances,
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800]   don't do things that are illegal.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.080]   I think it's stupid.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.120]   And it's especially stupid
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.240]   when you have a little bit of money.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.480]   Now, I think we could all understand.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.520]   You think of a classic tale like "Les Mis," right?
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.460]   Jean Valjean, he goes to prison
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.960]   for stealing a loaf of bread.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.040]   I think most of us could look at somebody who steals
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.280]   to feed their family because they're totally poor.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.840]   And while we wouldn't condone
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.600]   that kind of immoral behavior,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.440]   it's an understandable kind of immoral behavior.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.760]   We wouldn't say it's okay,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.740]   but we would say we understand why.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.240]   It makes sense to us.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.640]   But when you have enough to eat,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.700]   when you have enough money to do things
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.760]   that might result in your losing your freedom, is stupid.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.020]   If you have a little bit of money,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.320]   you have enough to live on,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.240]   one of the foundational concepts
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.080]   that should never be broken in your life
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.800]   is don't do stupid things that might send you to prison.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.760]   So what are some examples of this?
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.620]   Well, if you've got a business idea,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.620]   but it's illegal in the place that you are
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.900]   wanting to live and work, don't do it there.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.440]   Go somewhere else where that business idea is legal.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.080]   If you wanna do something that's forbidden
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.340]   in the place that you are, no matter how horrible, right?
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.880]   You wanna, I don't know, you wanna sleep with prostitutes
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   or you wanna go and do drugs.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.940]   Well, don't do them where you live
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.400]   if those activities are illegal there.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.560]   Go to some place where drugs are legal
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.400]   or go to some place where prostitution is legal.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.600]   If you wanna drive fast, don't drive fast
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.340]   on the interstate in the United States, go to a racetrack.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.920]   Go to Germany and drive on the Autobahn.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.160]   Go and do those things where they're legal
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.600]   so that you can avoid going to prison.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.380]   Years ago, I developed a very simple concept.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.460]   I call it the meter concept.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.840]   It's always cheaper for you to feed the meter
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.040]   than to pay the ticket.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.280]   And I learned this many years ago through, wait for it,
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.640]   getting parking tickets.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.680]   And I realized that I thought I was super smart.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.360]   I've got the perfect parking space
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.520]   where I can just save a few bucks back here.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   I'll save a few bucks or I'll just put in just what I need.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.000]   And I got these stupid parking tickets
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.060]   and I finally realized that the hassle to my life
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.740]   and the money that I was spending
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.780]   by getting these parking tickets was far more
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.680]   than what it would cost me to simply pay the meter.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   So I developed a personal philosophy.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.320]   Pay the meter, it's cheaper to feed the meter
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.240]   than it is to pay the ticket.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.000]   And I apply this in every area, right?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.960]   Speeding, right?
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.880]   Years ago, when I was younger, I got speeding tickets
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.000]   'cause I would drive too fast.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.720]   And finally I decided I'm not gonna drive fast anymore.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.080]   This is dumb.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's cheaper for me to leave a little bit earlier
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.680]   or to be a little bit late and just drive the speed limit
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.040]   than it is for me to get a speeding ticket.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.360]   So I disciplined myself to be ahead of time
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.080]   so that I'm never late.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.000]   Or if I wanted to get somewhere fast,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.760]   it's gonna be cheaper for me to take an airplane
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.000]   than to pay the speeding ticket
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.820]   and far less disruptive for my life.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.480]   It's cheaper to pay for the cab or the Uber
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.040]   than it is for you to drive drunk,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.000]   no matter how long of a cab ride is.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.160]   I promise you, it's cheaper to feed the meter
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.720]   than to pay the penalty.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.320]   And it comes the same way with taxes.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.200]   It's cheaper for you to pay the taxes
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.840]   than it is for you to pay the penalty,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.960]   especially when that penalty can include prison,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.980]   a place that you and I do not want to go.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.200]   So they put people in prison for not paying their taxes.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.160]   They put people in prison for not reporting their income.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.280]   So I strongly recommend to you
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.520]   that you simply pay your taxes and report your income.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.480]   As far as I'm concerned,
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.760]   it's a completely unacceptable risk to go to prison.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.640]   That's argument number one.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.240]   We'll come back to this in just a moment.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.440]   But argument number two, I think,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.840]   is perhaps even more powerful and more persuasive.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.720]   Argument two is this.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   If you are committed to cheating on your taxes,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.220]   you will be doomed to a lifetime
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.180]   of low-income, off-the-table work,
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.100]   instead of being able to flourish
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.320]   and develop to your maximum potential.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.140]   As I see it, you're never going to win in the long run
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.980]   by being a tax cheat.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.500]   Again, I'm not making a moral argument.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.140]   I'm not saying it's morally wrong
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.140]   for you to not pay taxes.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.300]   We'll talk about that in a future show.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.080]   I'm simply saying, practically,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.240]   you're not going to succeed at a very high level
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.960]   if you're always looking over your shoulder,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.560]   wondering if the taxman is there
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.520]   to put you in handcuffs and lead you away to prison.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   And here's why this is so important.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   You and I both know that thousands, nay, tens of thousands,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.640]   nay, hundreds of thousands, nay, millions of people
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.880]   in the United States of America cheat on their taxes.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.440]   According to some industry statistics,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.220]   Wikipedia, in the article on tax evasion,
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.040]   says that the United States has one of the highest levels
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.080]   of voluntary compliance of tax paying in the world.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.640]   It says, "Nearly all Americans believe
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.120]   "that cheating on taxes is morally
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.480]   "and ethically unacceptable."
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.840]   We'll talk about that another day.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.540]   "The voluntary compliance rate,"
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.680]   which is a technical measurement of taxes being paid
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.720]   both on time and voluntarily,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.240]   "in the United States is generally around 81 to 84%.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.240]   "This is one of the highest rates in the world.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.880]   "By contrast, Germany's voluntary compliance rate is 68%,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.840]   "and Italy's is 62%.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.020]   "So in the United States of America,
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.140]   "we have a very high voluntary compliance rate.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.920]   "And yet you and I both know that millions of people
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.080]   "all across the country cheat on their taxes."
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.320]   Well, why then are not millions of people in prison
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.080]   for cheating on their taxes?
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.940]   Because while the United States of America
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.600]   has one of the most aggressive police forces in the world,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.940]   by, in my opinion, the United States of America,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.240]   if not a police state, in some ways comes very close
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   to the very definition of a police state.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.820]   The United States of American population
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.160]   is 5% of the global population,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.660]   and yet accounts for 25% of the world's prisoners.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.240]   5% of the world's population,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.920]   and yet has 25% of the world's prisoners,
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.280]   people sitting in prison.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.880]   And the United States of America,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.640]   roughly one in 100, at least as of about 2012,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.960]   which is the last time I remember the story,
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   I don't know if it's been updated,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   but about one in 100 U.S. Americans
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.760]   is currently incarcerated.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.040]   It's actually one in 99.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.640]   More than one in 100 is currently incarcerated.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.400]   Those one in 36 Hispanic Americans is incarcerated,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.080]   and one in 15 black adults, sorry, these are for adults,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.440]   one in 100 American adults are in prison.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.240]   Those are astonishing numbers.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.640]   What's more fascinating is if you look
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.140]   at the imprisonment rates on the population,
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.160]   the United States of America has the highest
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.120]   imprisonment rate across the population in the world.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.000]   In the United States, roughly 716 people
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.860]   per 100,000 people are imprisoned.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.640]   The next closest is Rwanda at 492 people per 100,000,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.800]   followed by Russia at 475.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.000]   United States, 716 out of 100,000.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.280]   Rwanda, 492.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   Russia, 475 out of 100.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.160]   Brazil, 274.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.320]   Spain, 147.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.680]   Australia, 130.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.800]   Pretty shocking when you actually look at it.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.520]   China has 121 people out of 100,000 in prison.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.420]   Roughly, I'm gonna guess this is what,
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.840]   six times, seven times?
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.360]   The United States has six to seven times
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.960]   the prison population of China.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.980]   You're not playing around with people who play around
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.120]   when it comes to putting people in prison.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.560]   One of the most amazing things, over the last 40 years,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.240]   the US prison population has risen roughly 700%.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.880]   So you're dealing with a country
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.080]   that puts more of its population in prison
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.120]   for more reasons than any other country
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   on the face of the earth.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.740]   And that's only skyrocketing.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.920]   You're dealing with a country that has
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.120]   one of the largest police and military forces in the world.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.520]   You're dealing with a country that uses
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.280]   some of the maximum levels of force
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.120]   to control its population.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.880]   You're dealing with a country that operates
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.120]   the world's largest spy network,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.820]   that literally snoops on the emails and phone calls
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.700]   and movements of almost everyone on earth
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.100]   in some way, shape, or form.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.960]   You're dealing with a country that has showed
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.760]   no reservation about using its military force
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.900]   all around the world.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.760]   This is the culture of the country,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.280]   and you're gonna mess around with this?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.080]   You're gonna mess around with that kind of police presence?
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.400]   You say, "Joshua, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.200]   "Hold on a second, hold on a second, okay.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.160]   "I get that, and I get that the United States
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.260]   "has an incarceration problem,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.020]   "but that's just because we lock people up who smoke weed,
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.380]   "right, and if we just change the laws
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.000]   "and legalize marijuana, then that would fix all the problem.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.880]   "After all, nobody goes to prison for tax evasion."
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.580]   And you're right, sort of, okay?
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.040]   The United States of America tax collection system
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.160]   is a system that runs on intimidation.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.400]   We don't actually put that many tax offenders
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.880]   into prison on an annual basis,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.000]   something like 500 people per year,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.800]   which when compared to the number of people
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   that file a tax return in the United States
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.940]   is a relatively small number of people.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.080]   But who does the country put into prison?
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.440]   That's the bigger question.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.200]   Well, they put people in prison
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.280]   who owe a lot of money on tax and who are high profile.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.120]   Why?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.960]   Because the system runs on intimidation.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.880]   And so the tax enforcement agencies
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.080]   are always looking for people who are high profile
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.720]   and who owe a lot of tax.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.020]   And you're dealing with a system
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.320]   that pays tax informants, snitches,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.920]   a percentage of the revenue received by the IRS
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.780]   in order for them to inform on you.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:49.640]   So if there's anybody that knows about your tax cheating,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.200]   could be an employee, a disgruntled employee,
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.820]   could be a disgruntled brother-in-law,
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.120]   could be a disgruntled ex-wife.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.280]   If there's anybody who knows about your tax cheating
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.600]   other than you, they can simply call the IRS,
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.520]   say, "Hey, IRS, so-and-so doesn't pay their taxes."
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.700]   The IRS will start the case,
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.640]   they'll start working it through the process.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.800]   And if you're a big enough fish,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.040]   they will take you through and they will hang you.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.580]   Not literally, but in every other way they possibly can.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.640]   They will take all your money
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.200]   and they'll lock you in prison.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.240]   That is a system that is stacked against you
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.400]   if you make a lot of money.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.620]   So what do you do to protect yourself?
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.840]   Well, again, I said that millions of people
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.360]   cheat on their taxes across the United States
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.280]   every single year.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.660]   Millions of people take some garden produce
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.400]   and sell it across the back fence
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.000]   and make a few extra bucks.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.700]   Millions of people make tips at work
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.800]   and don't report 100% of their tips.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.680]   Millions of people do it, but they're all little fish.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.400]   And you could do this and be completely safe
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.740]   for, I think, probably your entire life.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.280]   You could have a wood cutting business
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.760]   and you could sell wood off the back of your pickup truck
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.640]   and do that probably your entire life
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.840]   and nobody would come after you.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.760]   You could probably have a professional job,
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.300]   make some money, work in your own company
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.560]   and just not pay your taxes
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.160]   and you could probably be okay for the rest of your life.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.440]   Not get locked up.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.960]   Years ago, in the very early stages
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.940]   of radical personal finance,
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.840]   I interviewed the guy who wrote "99 Tax Strike Techniques,"
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   the book "99 Tactics for Tax Strike Resisters"
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.960]   and their people.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.880]   He's not paid taxes for years
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.960]   and done it very openly, blogged about it,
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.320]   just not paid taxes.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.240]   But here's what's true about every single one of those cases.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.400]   They don't make a lot of money
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.360]   and they don't maximize their potential.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.560]   What they often do is choose not to pay taxes
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.120]   and live in fear.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.740]   And this is one of those fears that, in my opinion,
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.360]   is probably debilitating for many people.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.160]   This is one of those fears that can completely mess you up.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.240]   If you're sitting around at night thinking,
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.360]   man, I'd really like to go and do this other thing
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.020]   but then someone might know about my taxes.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.060]   Someone might report on me.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.360]   I can't hire too many employees.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.200]   I can't bring them in.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.040]   I can't grow too much 'cause they'll say,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.080]   what about your taxes?
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.200]   And they'll report on me.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.120]   I can't tell my wife.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.960]   I can't tell my lover.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.840]   I can't tell so-and-so about the money that I make
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.760]   or they'll say, they'll report on me
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.200]   and they'll go and collect their percentage of it.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.920]   And so you live in fear.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.840]   And friend, that's no way to live.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.680]   That's no way to live,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.640]   especially when you have potential for so much more.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.960]   So I wanna give you a couple of solutions here.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.320]   I want to play a metaphorical game with you.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.760]   Now, I've gotten in trouble
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.160]   in radical personal finance in the past
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.400]   because I've compared state governments
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.260]   with people like local cartel governments.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.120]   I've compared state governments with the mafia.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.720]   I'm not entirely convinced those are unfair comparisons
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.600]   but today I'm not gonna do that.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.640]   I think there's some lessons there
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.080]   but today I'm not gonna do that.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.940]   I'm just gonna say, let's play a game, right?
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.360]   Let's put this into another context
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.080]   and see if we can stimulate some of your creative thinking
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.320]   so that you can understand
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.080]   how you can think about your problems
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.680]   and how to solve them.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.080]   Let's pretend that you live in a local neighborhood, right?
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.220]   We've all seen, you know, "Godfather" movies
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.360]   where you think about the mafia living in New York.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.240]   So let's pretend you live in a certain neighborhood
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.400]   in New York where the mafia is acting
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.440]   or could be a local cartel or something like that.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.640]   Some local organization that takes upon themselves
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   the need to provide protection for their residents.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.400]   Okay, we know how this works from the movies.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.240]   They, you don't need to have any real experience.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.080]   We know how this works, right?
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.760]   They come and they knock on the door and they say,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.060]   "Hey, dear Joe, Mr. Business Owner, Joe, listen,
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:38.000]   me and the boys, you know, we're gonna make you a deal,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.680]   right, we're gonna make you a deal
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.880]   and we're going to offer you protection
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.760]   because we know that things are hard, right?
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.000]   There are people that could come that can mess up your store.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.760]   There are people that could probably close your business
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.720]   if you didn't have someone looking out for your interest.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.360]   So me and the boys, you know,
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.120]   we're gonna look out for your interest
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.520]   and here's what we're gonna do, okay?
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.440]   We're not gonna take too much money.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.480]   We're just gonna take X number of dollars per week.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.120]   Every Friday, our man will come in.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.800]   You just hand him an envelope.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.520]   He'll walk right out the back door
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.400]   and we'll keep our guys posted out front
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.300]   to make sure that you're taken care of.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.720]   Now, they come to you and they make you this offer.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.800]   Question is this, do you have a choice to refuse that offer?
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.960]   Even if the guy doesn't say,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.840]   "Now, listen, I'm gonna make you an offer you cannot refuse,"
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.040]   right, he doesn't come to you and say that.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.440]   He just says, "This is the offer."
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   Do you have the choice to refuse that?
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:39.640]   Answer is, "Well, if you wanna pay the consequences," right?
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.120]   If you wanna pay the consequences,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.960]   then you have the right to refuse it.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.440]   Think about a guy like me, right?
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.180]   I was born in the United States.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.160]   I didn't, nobody really ever came, made me that offer,
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.120]   but I just know this is how things work, right?
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.640]   If I don't pay the boys a certain amount of money,
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.160]   I don't send them my checks, give them their money,
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.900]   I might face some problems.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.000]   Now, if I give them my money,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.760]   they give me some protection, right?
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.880]   They post the police officers out front.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.440]   They send the fire department, right?
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.840]   If my fire, if there's a fire in my place.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.200]   They pave the roads, you know,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.300]   they take care of the poor people.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.640]   So we know the deal, right?
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.960]   I just pay the money, and if I don't wanna pay the money,
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.640]   I'm gonna have a problem.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.400]   So the question comes down to this.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.800]   If you don't pay them their protection money,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.480]   they're going to break your legs
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   if they're the mafia, right?
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.480]   Now, of course, the IRS agents are a little bit nicer,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.560]   right, they send the police, they take all your stuff,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.080]   they sell it all at an auction, they seize your property,
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.000]   they put a sticker over your front door,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.240]   say that this property and this business
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.080]   has been closed for tax collection purposes.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.520]   If you don't go through the court process
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.040]   and you don't cough up some money for them,
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.280]   then they toss you in jail, right?
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   And they give you something to think about
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.840]   for a little while, right?
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   But if you just pay them, they leave you alone.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.640]   Now, here's how the mafia works.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.760]   The mafia guys know that they need to charge you
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.640]   as much money as they can to maximize their revenues,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.280]   but not so much money that you're upset with them,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.280]   where it's worth your getting together with your neighbors
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.880]   and saying, "That's it, we're gonna kick these guys out."
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.840]   Right, 'cause if they did that,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.440]   they would have a bit of a rebellion on their hands.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.160]   Hmm, that sounds suspiciously like something called
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.040]   the Laffer Curve, doesn't it?
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.600]   That sounds suspiciously like,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.720]   yeah, I think it is the Laffer Curve, right?
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.160]   This basic idea that a government needs to charge
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.440]   an amount of tax money that maximizes the tax revenues
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.560]   to that government, but not so much tax money
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.800]   that individuals change their behavior to earn less money,
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.520]   or they go somewhere else where they're treated
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.560]   a little bit better.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.400]   Hmm, interesting how there's some parallels there.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.960]   A lot of parallels.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.280]   But think about this for a moment.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.200]   All right, they come to you, they make you an offer
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.080]   you can't refuse, right?
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.920]   You didn't choose that.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.000]   You didn't choose that the mafia
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.840]   took over your neighborhood.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.680]   You didn't choose that the United States of America
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.800]   owns the land on which you live.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.960]   That's okay.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.840]   So you have, as I see it, three choices.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   What are your three choices?
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.640]   Choice number one is you can pay them their money.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.200]   If you pay them their money, they leave you alone.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.520]   They're not gonna come in and mess with you.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.640]   They're not gonna break your legs.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.920]   They're not gonna harass you.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.160]   You just pay them their money.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.920]   Things are simple.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.760]   And if you pay them their money,
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.280]   it's probably not gonna be an overwhelming amount of money.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.920]   They might change it from time to time, right?
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.360]   They might look around and realize,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.200]   you know, listen, Joe, business looks pretty good.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.000]   I think you could pay us a little bit more money.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.960]   They might adjust things.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.760]   They might say, you're making quite a bit of money,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.000]   so we're gonna increase your taxes.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.240]   But as long as you pay us our money, you're gonna be okay.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.560]   I think choice number one that you have
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.920]   is pay them their money.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   As I see it, I think that's the choice
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.000]   that the vast majority of people should do, should make.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.160]   Just pay them the money.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.040]   It's not that much.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.640]   It's only 47% of your income.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.040]   It's only 35% of this.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.200]   It's only 10% of your wealth.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.400]   It's not that much.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.560]   Just pay them your money.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.080]   Then you can live where you live.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.320]   You can operate your business.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.360]   Maybe you can all get rich.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.040]   Joe, listen, you're making enough money
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.320]   that you can give us our cut
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.840]   in exchange for your protection,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.560]   and you can still get rich.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.320]   So choice number one you have is to pay them their money.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.400]   And I think that's a fair and reasonable choice
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.840]   for any of us to make.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.720]   Choice number two is you can say, you know what?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.200]   I ain't paying you a dime.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.000]   And you can do it in whatever way, right?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.320]   You can hide the money out back.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.400]   You can keep a couple sets of books.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.320]   You can do whatever you need to do,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.920]   but you can say, I ain't paying you a dime.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.080]   If you take that path,
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.200]   you wind up with potentially very severe consequences.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   You might lose some people that you love
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.920]   because you're locked in prison, of course,
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.520]   and you can't see them.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.640]   And they forget about you and go on with their life.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.920]   You might be deprived of your health
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.440]   because, of course, you're in prison.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.880]   I'm saying, you know, obviously,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.320]   that people get sick in prison, right?
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.120]   So there come consequences with choice number two.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.800]   Now, I think there are times
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.640]   in which honorable people might make that choice.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.320]   Throughout history, change has often happened
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.520]   when people said, I'm gonna stand up for what I believe in.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.000]   Consequences be damned.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.800]   No matter what, I'm gonna do this.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.560]   I think that's a reasonable choice.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.880]   But those aren't your only two choices.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.320]   Choice number three is also available to you.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.640]   Choice number three, what is it?
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   Well, they come knocking on your door,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.520]   and they say, Joe, we're gonna make you a deal.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.400]   You pay us X amount of dollars,
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.800]   or you're gonna have some problems.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.640]   Well, what could Joe choose to do?
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.880]   Joe could choose to say, this sucks.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.600]   I ain't paying these mafia goons this money.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.920]   And Joe closes up his shop, grabs his family,
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.560]   loads them up, loads up a moving truck,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.520]   and goes to the next town over,
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.560]   where those mafia guys aren't in control,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.400]   or goes to the next state over,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.320]   where there's a slightly more friendly organization
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.120]   that doesn't quite put such onerous demands onto him,
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.160]   and he opens his business there.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.480]   Now, that's clearly a disruptive solution.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.760]   Joe's family has to move.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.960]   Joe's wife has to leave her friends.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.680]   Joe's kids get pulled out of school.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.440]   Joe has to close his business,
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.720]   and maybe his business was only suitable in the local area.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.000]   But it is a choice.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.520]   It is a choice that Joe has,
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.280]   and it's a choice that gets Joe away
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.840]   from the goons with guns, peacefully.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.400]   Choice is yours.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.880]   As I see it, there are only two of those choices
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.120]   that are acceptable.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.320]   Either choice number one, to pay the money,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.840]   or choice number three, to leave.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   As far as I'm concerned, choice number two
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.240]   is completely unacceptable for reasonable, rational men
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.160]   who care about their freedom.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.280]   I wish we lived in a world in which principle mattered,
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.920]   and where you could get all your neighbors together
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.560]   and say, "Listen, we're not gonna do it,
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.800]   "but here's the problem.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.080]   "Your neighbors like the mafia.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.920]   "They like it.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.160]   "Hey, in some places, they even vote for the mafia.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.640]   "And if 75% of your neighbors have voted for the mafia,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.960]   "you only have two reasonable choices.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.360]   "Choice number one is live with it.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.480]   "Choice number two, or in this case, three, leave.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.800]   "You're not gonna change 75% of your neighbors' minds.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.680]   "You're not even gonna change 25% of them.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.000]   "It's not possible.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.920]   "So stop thinking it is,
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.560]   "and either learn to live with it or leave."
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:37.080]   For free-thinking men who are rational, pragmatic,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.320]   and who care about themselves,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.160]   their families, and their freedom,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.920]   I personally see no other choice.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.320]   I don't think you should doom yourself
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.160]   to a lifetime of poverty by taking on some manual job,
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.560]   some low-level job that just gives you just enough
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.160]   to get by on because you don't pay tax.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   I'm happy it exists.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.840]   It exists all over the world,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.520]   but I don't think that's a sandbox
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.800]   that you and I should bother playing in.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.880]   So remember, you have choice one or you have choice three,
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.160]   but choice two, as I see it, is simply not an option.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   We'll talk more about some ideas
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.040]   'cause here's the good thing about the mafia.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.440]   The mafia knows that you gotta run your business.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.560]   The mafia knows that if you don't succeed,
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.800]   they don't succeed.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.400]   The mafia wants you to succeed
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.440]   so that you can pay them their protection money.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.000]   And altogether, it might not be a bad deal.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.480]   Hey, if I could pay the mafia 100 bucks a week
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.520]   and they could make sure
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.120]   that my house didn't get broken into, okay, fine.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.880]   That's a reasonable deal,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.080]   which is why all over the world,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.560]   you see in local areas,
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.200]   you see people support the local cartel organization,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.480]   the local mafia organization.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.320]   Why?
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.200]   Because they get things done.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.400]   They deliver things that people want
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.760]   and they don't mind supporting them.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   That's what politics is.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.160]   Politics is ultimately force,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.320]   and if politicians don't provide
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.000]   for those that they want to represent,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.960]   then they lose their support and somebody else comes in.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   Happens all over the world all the time.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:06.160]   We'll talk more about other solutions you have,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.240]   but the reality is all of the old tax planning ideas
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   do work, right?
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.400]   The mafia gives you a chance to deduct certain things.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.520]   They make certain reasonable exceptions for you.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.240]   And as long as you play within their rules
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.960]   and report all your income,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.480]   give them all your books,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.560]   they'll let you go with whatever they say you owe.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.440]   So play that game or leave.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   Don't play game number two
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.840]   'cause I don't want you to go to prison.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.560]   I have no intention of going to prison.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.080]   I work very hard to stay squeaky clean
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.520]   so I can stay out of prison.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.920]   A major life goal of mine is not go to prison.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.480]   So because of that, I'm gonna follow the rules
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.880]   and I'm gonna encourage you to as well.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.240]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
