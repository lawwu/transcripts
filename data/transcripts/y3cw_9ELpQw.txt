[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   A black hole is a mirror.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.320]   And the way it's a mirror is if light, a photon,
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.660]   bounces off your face towards the black hole,
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.540]   it goes straight to the black hole,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.740]   just falls in, you never see it again.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.980]   But if it just misses the black hole,
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.180]   it'll swing around the back and come back to you.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.700]   And you see yourself from the photon
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.320]   that went around the back of the black hole.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.700]   But not only can that happen,
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.680]   the black hole, the photon can swing around twice
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.000]   and come back.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   So you actually see an infinite number of copies of yourself.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.720]   - The following is a conversation with Andrew Strominger,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.600]   theoretical physicist at Harvard,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   whose research seeks to shed light
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.760]   on the unification of fundamental laws of nature,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.640]   the origin of the universe, and the quantum structure
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.720]   of black holes and event horizons.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.680]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.760]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.040]   in the description.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880]   And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Strominger.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740]   You are part of the Harvard Black Hole Initiative,
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.800]   which has theoretical physicists, experimentalists,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360]   and even philosophers.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   So let me ask the big question.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.560]   What is a black hole from a theoretical,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.360]   from an experimental,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.880]   maybe even from a philosophical perspective?
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.880]   - So a black hole is defined, theoretically,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.180]   as a region of space-time
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440]   from which light can never escape,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.960]   therefore it's black.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.880]   Now, that's just the starting point.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.760]   Many weird things follow from that basic definition,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.440]   but that is the basic definition.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.160]   - What is light that can't escape from a black hole?
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.920]   - Well, light is the stuff that comes out of the sun,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.280]   that stuff that goes into your eyes.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.760]   Light is one of the stuff that disappears
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.400]   when the lights go off.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.240]   This is stuff that appears when the lights come on.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   Of course, I could give you a mathematical definition,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.920]   or a physical mathematical definition,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   but I think it's something that we all understand
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.720]   very intuitively what is light.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   Black holes, on the other hand,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.280]   we don't understand intuitively.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.040]   They're very weird.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840]   And one of the questions is, about black holes,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.660]   which I think you were alluding to,
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.980]   is why doesn't light get out,
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.280]   or how is it that there can be a region of space-time
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.760]   from which light can't escape?
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.040]   It definitely happens.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.980]   We've seen those regions.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.040]   We have spectacular pictures,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.280]   especially in the last several years of those regions.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.080]   They're there.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.260]   In fact, they're up in the sky,
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.340]   thousands or millions of them.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.820]   We don't yet know how many.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.600]   But the proper explanation
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   of why light doesn't escape from a black hole
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.840]   is still a matter of some debate.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.760]   And one explanation,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.060]   which perhaps Einstein might have given,
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.120]   is that light carries energy.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   You know it carries energy because we have photocells
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.640]   and we can take the light from the sun and collect it,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.180]   turn it into electricity.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.040]   So there's energy in light.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.480]   And anything that carries energy
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.620]   is subject to a gravitational pull.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.280]   Gravity will pull at anything with energy.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.400]   Now, it turns out that the gravitational pull
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   exerted by an object is proportional to its mass.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.000]   And so if you get enough mass in a small enough region,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.180]   you can prevent light from escaping.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.720]   And let me flesh that out a little more.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.760]   If you're on the Earth
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   and you're on a rocket ship leaving the surface of the Earth
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.080]   and if we ignore the friction from the air,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.880]   if your rocket accelerates up to 11 kilometers per second,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.040]   that's escape velocity.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.240]   And if there were no friction,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   it could just continue forever to the next galaxy.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.560]   On the moon, which has less mass,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.440]   it's only seven kilometers per second.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.400]   So, but going in the other direction,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.860]   if you have enough mass in one place,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.860]   the escape velocity can become the speed of light.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.560]   If you shine light straight up away from the Earth,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.000]   it doesn't have too much trouble.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.320]   It's going way above the escape velocity.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.420]   But if you have enough mass there,
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.480]   even light can't escape the escape velocity.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   And according to Einstein's theory of relativity,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.200]   there is an absolute speed limit in the universe,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.880]   the speed of light, and nothing makes any sense.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   Nothing could be self-consistent
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.680]   if there were objects that could exceed light speed.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   And so, in these very, very massive regions of space-time,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.300]   even light cannot escape.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.100]   - And the interesting thing is Einstein himself
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.740]   didn't think that these objects,
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.020]   we call the black holes, could exist.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.180]   But let me actually linger on this.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.820]   - Yeah, that's incredibly interesting.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.060]   - There's a lot of interesting things here.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.460]   First, the speed limit.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.260]   How wild is it to you, if you put yourself in the mind
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.900]   in the time of Einstein before him,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.020]   to come up with a speed limit, that there is a speed limit,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.160]   and that speed limit is the speed of light?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.280]   How difficult of an idea is that?
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.960]   You said from a mathematical physics perspective,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.520]   everything just kind of falls into place,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   but he wasn't, perhaps, maybe initially had the luxury
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.680]   to think mathematically.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.280]   He had to come up with it intuitively, yes?
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.960]   So how counterintuitive is this notion to you?
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.980]   Is it still crazy?
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.900]   - No, no.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.100]   So it's a very funny thing in physics.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   The best discoveries seem completely obvious in retrospect.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.820]   Even my own discoveries, which of course
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.420]   are far lesser than Einstein's,
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.620]   but many of my papers, many of my collaborators
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.500]   get all confused.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.780]   We'll try to understand something.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.420]   We say, we've got to solve this problem.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.020]   We'll get all confused.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.020]   Finally, we'll solve it.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.020]   We'll get it all together, and then we'll,
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.980]   all of a sudden, everything will fall into place.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.540]   We'll explain it, and then we'll look back
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.180]   at our discussions for the proceedings of months,
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.180]   and literally be unable to reconstruct how confused we were,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.020]   and how we could ever have thought of it any other way.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.860]   - That's so fascinating.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.900]   - And so not only can I not fathom
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.780]   how confused Einstein was before he,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.100]   when he started thinking about the issues,
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.940]   I can't even reconstruct my own confusion
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.740]   from two weeks ago.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.780]   So the really beautiful ideas in physics
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.500]   have this very hard to get yourself back into the mindset.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   Of course, Einstein was confused about many, many things.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.140]   It doesn't matter if you're a physicist.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.220]   It's not how many things you got wrong.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.980]   It's not the ratio of how many you got wrong
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.620]   to how many you got right.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.380]   It's the number that you got right.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.640]   So Einstein didn't believe black holes existed,
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.660]   even though he predicted them.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.660]   And I went and I read that paper, which he wrote.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.660]   Einstein wrote down his field equations in 1915,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.380]   and Schwarzschild solved them
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.460]   and discovered the black hole solution
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.980]   three or four months later, in very early 1916.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:17.020]   And 25 years later, Einstein wrote a paper.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.760]   So with 25 years to think about what this solution means,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   wrote a paper in which he said that black holes didn't exist.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.540]   And I'm like, well, if one of my students
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.160]   in my general relativity course wrote this,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.780]   I wouldn't pass them.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.900]   - You get a C minus, oh, you wouldn't pass them, okay.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.820]   - I get a C minus, okay.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.260]   Same thing with gravity waves.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.100]   He didn't believe--
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.620]   - Oh, he didn't believe in gravitational waves either?
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.620]   - He went back and forth, but he wrote a paper in, I think,
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.620]   '34, saying that gravity waves didn't exist
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.300]   because people were very confused
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.540]   about what a coordinate transformation is.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.260]   And in fact, this confusion
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.260]   about what a coordinate transformation is has persisted,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.060]   and we actually think we're on the edge of solving it
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.880]   100 years later.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.660]   - Well, what--
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.620]   - 100 years later.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.060]   - Well, what is coordinate transformation,
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.900]   as it was 100 years ago to today?
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.260]   Let's imagine I want to draw a map
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.700]   with pictures of all the states and the mountains,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.860]   and then I wanna draw the weather forecast,
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.780]   what the temperatures are gonna be all over the country.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:44.860]   And I do that using one set of weather stations,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.060]   and I number the weather stations,
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.500]   and you have some other set of weather stations,
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.420]   and you do the same thing.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.780]   So the coordinates are the locations of the weather stations.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.820]   They're how we describe where the things are.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.820]   At the end of the day, we should draw the same map.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.200]   That is coordinate invariance.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.300]   And if we're telling somebody,
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.220]   we're gonna tell somebody at a real physical operation,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.940]   we want you to stay as dry as possible
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.060]   on your drive from here to California,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.500]   we should give them exactly the same route.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.780]   No matter which weather stations we use or how we,
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.180]   it's a very trivial,
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.740]   the labeling of points is an artifact
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.020]   and not in the real physics.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.240]   So it turns out that that's almost true,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.740]   but not quite.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.440]   There's some subtleties to it.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.820]   - The statement that you should always have the same,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.500]   give at least the same kind of trajectory,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.100]   the same kind of instructions,
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.580]   no matter the weather stations.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.020]   - Yeah, there's some very delicate subtleties to that,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.780]   which began to be noticed in the '50s.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:13.780]   It's mostly true, but when you have a space-time with edges,
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:19.140]   it gets very tricky how you label the edges.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.300]   - And space-time in terms of space or in terms of time,
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.620]   in terms of everything, just space-time?
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.260]   - Either one, space or time.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.500]   That gets very tricky.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   And Einstein didn't have it right.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.380]   In fact, he had an earlier version of general relativity
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:42.160]   in 1914, which he was very excited about,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.360]   which was wrong,
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.580]   gave, it wasn't fully coordinate invariant,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.260]   it was only partially coordinate invariant, it was wrong.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.260]   It gave the wrong answer for bending light to the sun
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.300]   by a factor of two.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.980]   There was an expedition sent out to measure it
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.820]   during World War I.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.620]   They were captured before they could measure it.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.100]   (both laughing)
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.100]   And that gave Einstein four more years to clean his act up,
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.820]   by which time he'd gotten it right.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.820]   So it's a very tricky business,
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.820]   but once it's all laid out, it's clear.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.820]   - Then why do you think Einstein
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.420]   didn't believe his own equations
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.220]   and didn't think that black holes are real?
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.860]   Why was that such a difficult idea for him?
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.860]   - Well, something very interesting happens
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.960]   in Schwarzschild's solution of the Einstein equation.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.720]   (mouse clicking)
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   I think his reasoning was ultimately wrong,
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   but let me explain to you what it was.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:06.780]   At the center of the black hole, behind the horizon,
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:13.000]   in a region that nobody can see and live to tell about it,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.540]   as the center of the black hole, there's a singularity,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.280]   and if you pass the horizon, you go into the singularity,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.420]   you get crushed, and that's the end of everything.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:29.980]   Now, the word singularity means that,
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:37.620]   it just means that Einstein's equations break down.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.660]   They become infinite.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.240]   You write them down, you put 'em on the computer.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.380]   When the computer hits that singularity, it crashes.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.580]   Everything becomes infinite, there's two.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.760]   So the equations are just no good there.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:59.440]   Now, that's actually not a bad thing.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.880]   It's a really good thing, and let me explain why.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:11.360]   So, it's an odd thing that Maxwell's equation
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   and Newton's theory never exhibit this phenomena.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.560]   You write them down, you can solve them exactly.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.340]   They're really, Newton's theory of gravity,
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.160]   they're really very simple theories.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.120]   You can solve them, well, you can't solve
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.800]   the three-body problem, but you can certainly
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.640]   solve a lot of things about them.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   Nevertheless, there was never any reason,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.320]   even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps fell for this trap,
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.960]   there were never any reason to think
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.560]   that these equations were exact.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:06.600]   And every, there's no equation, well,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.960]   there's some equations that we've written down
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.340]   that we still think are exact.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.480]   Some people still think are exact.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.840]   My view is that there's no exact equation.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.280]   - Everything is an approximation.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.720]   - Everything is an approximation.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.160]   - And you're trying to get as close as possible.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.200]   - So you're saying objective truth
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.600]   doesn't exist in this world?
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.760]   The internet's gonna be very mad at you.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.440]   - We could discuss that, but that's a different thing.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.980]   We wouldn't say Newton's theory was wrong.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.800]   It had very, very small corrections,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.380]   incredibly small corrections.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.440]   It's actually a puzzle why they're so small.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.400]   So if you watch the precession of Mercury's perihelion,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   this was the first indication of something going wrong.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.080]   According to Newton's theory,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.960]   Mercury has an elliptical orbit.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.440]   The long part of it moves around
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.760]   as other planets come by and perturb it and so on.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.140]   And so this was measured by Le Verrier in 1859
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   and he compared theory and experiment
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.140]   and he found out that the perihelion precess
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.140]   moves around the sun once every 233 centuries
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:30.020]   instead of every 231 centuries.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.260]   Now this is the wonderful thing about science.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.760]   Why was this guy?
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.800]   I mean, you don't get any idea how much work this is.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.640]   But of course he made one of the greatest discoveries
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.680]   in the history of science without even knowing
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.580]   what good it was gonna be.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.920]   So that's how small, that was the first sign
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.020]   that there was something wrong with Newton.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.680]   Now, so the corrections to Newton's law
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.320]   are very, very small, but they're definitely there.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.720]   The corrections to electromagnetism,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.800]   they're mostly, the ones that we see
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.700]   are mostly coming from quantum effects.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.480]   And-- - So the corrections
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.480]   for Maxwell's equations is when you get super tiny
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.760]   and then the corrections for Newton's laws of gravity
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.760]   is when you get super big.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.760]   That's when you require corrections.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.840]   - That's true, but I would phrase it as saying
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.920]   when it's super accurate.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.140]   If you look at the Bohr atom, Maxwell electromagnetism
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.400]   is not a very good approximation to the force
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.680]   between the proton and the electron.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.760]   The quantum mechanics, if you didn't have
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.240]   quantum mechanics, the electron would spiral
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.600]   into the proton and the atom would collapse.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.040]   So that's a huge correction there.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.160]   - Sure.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.280]   - So every theory gets corrected as we learn more.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.640]   Just be no reason to suppose that it should be otherwise.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.400]   - How is this related to the singularity?
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.940]   Why the singularity-- - So when you hit
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.940]   the singularity, you know that you need some improvement
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:29.000]   to Einstein's theory of gravity.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.520]   And that improvement, we understand what kind of things
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.400]   that improvement should involve.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.320]   It should involve quantum mechanics,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.240]   quantum effects become important there.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.160]   It's a small thing.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   And we don't understand exactly what the theory is,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.680]   but we know there's no reason to think,
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.420]   Einstein's theory was invented to describe
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.920]   weakly curved things, the solar system and so on.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.920]   It's incredibly robust that we now see that it works
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   very well near the horizons around black holes and so on.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.640]   So it's a good thing that the theory drives itself
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.500]   that it predicts its own demise.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.420]   Newton's gravity had its demise.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.760]   There were regimes in which it wasn't valid.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.920]   Maxwell's electromagnetism had its demise.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.120]   There was regimes in which quantum effects
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.740]   greatly modified the equations.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.920]   But general relativity all on its own
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.840]   found a system which originally was fine
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   would perversely wander off into a configuration
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.680]   in which Einstein's equations no longer applied.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.240]   - So to you, the edges of the theory are wonderful.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.080]   The failures of the theory--
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   - Edges are wonderful because that keeps us in business.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.800]   - So one of the things you said, I think,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   in your TED Talk that the fact that quantum mechanics
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.600]   and relativity don't describe everything
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.240]   and then they clash is wonderful.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.360]   I forget the adjective you used,
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.920]   but it was something like this.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.260]   So why is that?
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.360]   Why is that interesting?
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.460]   Do you in that same way that there's contradictions
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.720]   that create discovery?
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.200]   - There's no question in my mind,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.560]   of course many people would disagree with me,
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.560]   that now is the most wonderful time to be a physicist.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.160]   So people look back at,
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:55.580]   it's a classical thing to say among physicists,
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.100]   I wish it were 1920.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.660]   Quantum mechanics had been just understood.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.920]   There was the periodic table.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.000]   But in fact, that was such a rich thing
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   that, well, so a lot of exciting stuff happened around 1920.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:25.240]   It took a whole century to sort out
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.880]   the new insights that we got.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.680]   - Especially adding some experimental stuff
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.480]   into the bunch, actually making observations
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.320]   and integrating all the data.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.160]   - Adding the experimental thing.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.240]   - All the computers also help with visualizations
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.080]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.900]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.160]   It was a whole sort of wonderful century.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.200]   I mean, the seed of general relativity
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   was the incompatibility of Maxwell's theory
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.400]   of the electromagnetic field
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.560]   with Newton's laws of gravity.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.720]   They were incompatible because
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.940]   if you look at Maxwell's theory,
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:08.240]   there's a contradiction if anything goes faster
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.440]   than the speed of light.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.080]   But Newton's theory of gravity,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   the gravitational field, the gravitational force,
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   is instantaneously transmitted across the entire universe.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.360]   So you could, if you had a friend in another galaxy
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:36.200]   with a very sensitive measuring device
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.520]   that could measure the gravitational field,
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.640]   they could just take this cup of coffee
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.220]   and move it up and down in Morse code
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.600]   and they could get the message instantaneously
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.260]   over another galaxy.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.360]   That leads to all kinds of contradictions.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.440]   It's not self-consistent.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.480]   It was exactly in resolving those contradictions
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.160]   that Einstein came up with the general theory
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.080]   of relativity and it's fascinating
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.420]   how this contradiction, which seems like
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.340]   maybe it's kind of a technical thing,
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:14.840]   led to a whole new vision of the universe.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.880]   Now, let's not get fooled because
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.520]   lots of contradictions are technical things.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.840]   We haven't set up the,
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.480]   we run into other kinds of contradictions
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.360]   that are technical and they don't seem to,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.620]   we understood something wrong, we made a mistake,
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.500]   we set up our equations in the wrong way,
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.680]   we didn't translate the formalisms.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.360]   - As opposed to revealing some deep mystery
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.440]   that's yet to be uncovered.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.280]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.920]   And so we're never very sure
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.320]   which are the really important ones.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.360]   - But to you, the difference between quantum mechanics
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.440]   and general relativity, the tension,
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.640]   the contradiction there seems to hint
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.880]   at some deeper, deeper thing that's going
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.240]   to be discovered in the century.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.600]   - Yes, because that one has been understood
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.320]   since the '50s.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:08.340]   Pauli was the first person to notice it
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.820]   and Hawking in the early '70s gave it
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.780]   a really much more visceral form.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:21.100]   And people have been hurling themselves at it,
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.300]   trying to reduce it to some technicality,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.820]   but nobody has succeeded.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.500]   And the efforts to understand it have led to
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.640]   all kinds of interesting relations
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.440]   between quantum systems and applications
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.520]   to other fields and so on.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.280]   - Well, let's actually jump around.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.120]   - Okay.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.940]   - So we'll return to black holes,
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.800]   I have a million questions there,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.400]   but let's go into this unification,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.200]   the battle against the contradictions
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.560]   and the tensions between the theories of physics.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.060]   What is quantum gravity?
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.760]   Maybe what is the standard model of physics?
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.960]   What is quantum mechanics?
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.480]   What is general relativity?
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.740]   What's quantum gravity?
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.080]   What are all the different unification efforts?
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.440]   - Okay, so--
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.660]   - Again, five questions.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.040]   - Yeah.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.920]   It's a theory that describes everything
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.400]   with astonishing accuracy.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.360]   It's the most accurate theory
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.720]   in the history of human thought.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   Theory and experiment have been successfully compared
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.120]   to 16 decimal place.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   We have that stenciled on the door where I work.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.480]   It's an amazing feat of the human mind.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:53.240]   It describes the electromagnetic interaction,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.580]   unifies the electromagnetic interaction
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.040]   with the so-called weak interaction,
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.640]   which you need some good tools
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.960]   to even view the weak interaction.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.060]   And then there's the strong interaction,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:11.840]   which binds the quarks into protons.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.120]   And the forces between them are mediated
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.480]   by something called Yang-Mills theory,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   which is a beautiful mathematical generalization
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   of electromagnetism in which the analogs
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.840]   of the photons themselves carry charge.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.040]   And so this, the final piece of this,
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.960]   of the standard model, everything in the standard model
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.920]   has been observed, its properties have been measured.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.740]   The final particle to be observed was the Higgs particle.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.400]   It was observed over a decade ago.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.160]   - The Higgs was observed a decade ago.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.800]   - I think it is, yeah.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.120]   - Wow, time flies.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.160]   - But you better check me on that, yeah.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.480]   - That's true, but so much fun has been happening.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.560]   - So much fun has been happening.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   And so that's all pretty well understood.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:20.200]   There's some things that might or might not,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.280]   around the edges of that, you know,
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   dark matter, neutrino masses, some sort of fine points
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.520]   or things we haven't quite measured perfectly and so on.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   But it's largely a very complete theory.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:43.760]   And we don't expect anything very new conceptually
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.680]   in the completion of that.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.160]   - Anything contradictory by new.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.200]   - Anything contradictory, yeah.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.000]   - I'll have some wild questions for you on that front.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.120]   But yeah, anything that, yeah, 'cause there's no gaps.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.160]   It's so accurate, so precise in its predictions,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.200]   it's hard to imagine something completely new.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.560]   - And it was all based on something called,
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.880]   let me not explain what it is,
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.120]   let me just throw out the buzzword,
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.720]   renormalizable quantum field theory.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.080]   They all fall in the category
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.960]   of renormalizable quantum field theory.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.400]   - I'm gonna throw that at a bar later to impress the girls.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.520]   - Good luck.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.360]   - Thank you.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.080]   - They all fall under that rubric.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   Gravity will not put that suit on.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.560]   So the force of gravity cannot be tamed
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.920]   by the same renormalizable quantum field theory
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   to which all the other forces so eagerly submitted.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.080]   - What is the effort of quantum gravity?
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.640]   What are the different efforts
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.480]   to have these two dance together effectively,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   to try to unify the standard model and general relativity,
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.960]   any kind of model of gravity?
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   - Sort of the one fully consistent model that we have
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:25.360]   that reconciles, that sort of tames gravity
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.560]   and reconciles it with quantum mechanics
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:36.060]   is string theory and its cousins.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:41.000]   And we don't know what, or if in any sense,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.040]   string theory describes the world, the physical world,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   but we do know that it is a consistent reconciliation
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.960]   of quantum mechanics and general relativity,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   and moreover, one which is able to incorporate particles
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:08.360]   and forces like the ones we see around us.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   So it hasn't been ruled out as an actual
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.160]   sort of unified theory of nature,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.520]   but there also isn't a, in my view,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.360]   some people would disagree with me,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:30.200]   but there isn't a reasonable possibility
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.840]   that we would be able to do an experiment
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.720]   in the foreseeable future,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   which would be sort of a yes or no to string theory.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.400]   - Okay, so you've been there
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.760]   from the early days of string theory,
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.120]   you've seen its developments.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   What are some interesting developments?
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.800]   What do you see as also the future of string theory?
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.120]   And what is string theory?
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:58.360]   - Well, the basic idea which emerged in the early '70s
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   was that if you take the notion of a particle
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   and you literally replace it by a little loop of string,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:22.120]   the strings are sort of softer than particles.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.800]   - What do you mean by softer?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.460]   - Well, you know, if you hit a particle,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.040]   if there were a particle on this table, a big one,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.120]   and you hit it, you might bruise yourself.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.560]   But if there was a string on the table,
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.320]   you would probably just push it around.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   And the source of the infinities in quantum field theory
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.060]   is that when particles hit each other,
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:50.060]   it's a little bit of a jarring effect.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:55.400]   And I've never described it this way before,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.680]   but it's actually scientifically accurate.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.360]   But if you throw strings at each other,
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.000]   it's a little more friendly.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   One thing I can't explain is how wonderfully precise
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.760]   all the mathematics is
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.600]   that goes into describing string theory.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.560]   We don't just wave our hands and throw strings around.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:18.560]   And there's some very compelling mathematical equations
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.000]   that describe it.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.120]   Now, what was realized in the early '70s
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.680]   is that if you replace particles by strings,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.120]   these infinities go away,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   and you get a consistent theory of gravity
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.300]   without the infinities.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:45.680]   And that may sound a little trivial,
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.800]   but at that point, it had already been 15 years
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.000]   that people had been searching around
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.760]   for any kind of theory that could do this.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.760]   And it was actually found kind of by accident.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.240]   And there are a lot of accidental discoveries
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.280]   in this subject.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.520]   Now, at the same time, it was believed then
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.040]   that string theory was an interesting sort of toy model
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.480]   for putting quantum mechanics
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.700]   and general relativity together on paper.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.440]   But that it couldn't describe
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.320]   some of the very idiosyncratic phenomena
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   that pertain to our own universe,
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.660]   in particular, the form of so-called parity violation.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.360]   Our world is-- - Ooh, another term
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.880]   for the bar later tonight.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.360]   - Parity violation.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.840]   - So if you go to the bar and--
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.520]   - I already got the renormalizable quantum field theory.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.440]   - And you look in the mirror across the bar,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.480]   the universe that you see in the mirror is not identical.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.840]   You would be able to tell if you show
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.960]   the lady in the bar a photograph
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.080]   that shows both the mirror and you.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.920]   - There's a difference.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.160]   - If she's smart enough, she'll be able to tell
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.480]   which one is the real world and which one is you.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.400]   Now, she would have to do some very precise measurements.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.960]   - Yes. (both laughing)
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.680]   - And if the photograph was too grainy,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.920]   it might not be possible.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.320]   But a principle is possible.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.920]   - Why is this interesting?
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.720]   Does this mean that there is some not perfect determinism?
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.800]   Or what does that mean, there's some uncertainty?
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.520]   - No, it's a very interesting feature of the real world
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.120]   that it isn't parity invariant.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.920]   In string theory, it was thought could not tolerate that.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:49.160]   And then it was learned in the mid '80s
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.740]   that not only could it tolerate that,
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.580]   but if you did things in the right way,
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:59.580]   you could construct a world involving strings
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.440]   that reconciled quantum mechanics and general relativity,
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.440]   which looked more or less like the world that we live in.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.220]   And now, that isn't to say
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.440]   that string theory predicted our world.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.520]   It just meant that it was consistent,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   that the hypothesis that string theory describes our world
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:30.640]   can't be ruled out from the get-go.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.640]   And it is also the only proposal for a complete theory
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:41.200]   that would describe our world.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.640]   Still, nobody will believe it
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   until there's some kind of direct experiment.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.080]   And I don't even believe it myself.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.360]   - Sure, which is a good place to be mentally
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.720]   as a physicist, right?
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.640]   I mean, Einstein didn't believe his own equations, right,
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   with the black hole.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.480]   Okay.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.880]   - Well, then when he was wrong about that.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.440]   (both laughing)
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.800]   He was wrong about that.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.000]   - But you might be wrong too, right?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.920]   So do you think string theory is dead
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.080]   if you were to bet all your money
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.000]   on the future of string theory?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.840]   - I think it's a logical error
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   to think that string theory is either right or wrong
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.200]   or dead or alive.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.840]   What it is is a stepping stone.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:36.440]   And an analogy I like to draw is Yang-Mills theory,
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.760]   which I mentioned a few minutes ago
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   in the context of standard model.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.120]   Yang-Mills theory was discovered
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   by Yang and Mills in the '50s.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:55.000]   And they thought that the symmetry of Yang and Mills theory
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.640]   described the relationship between the proton
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.720]   and the neutron.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.160]   That's why they invented it.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.480]   That turned out to be completely wrong.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.360]   It does, however, describe everything else
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.440]   in the standard model.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.560]   (both laughing)
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.920]   And it had a kind of inevitability.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.280]   They had some of the right pieces, but not the other ones.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.360]   They didn't have it quite in the right context.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.920]   And it had an inevitability to it,
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.280]   and it eventually sort of found its place.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.920]   And it's also true of Einstein's
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.680]   theory of general relativity.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.360]   He had the wrong version of it in 1914,
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.520]   and he was missing some pieces.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.600]   And you wouldn't say that his early version
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.640]   was right or wrong.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.400]   He'd understood the equivalence principle.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.840]   He'd understood spacetime curvature.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.240]   He just didn't have everything.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.200]   I mean, technically, you would have to say it was wrong.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.480]   And technically, you would have to say
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   Yang and Mills were wrong.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.260]   And I guess in that sense,
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.880]   I would believe just odds are.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.400]   We always keep finding new wrinkles.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.020]   Odds are we're gonna find new wrinkles in string theory,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.700]   and technically what we call string theory now
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.920]   isn't quite right, but--
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.400]   - We're always going to be wrong,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.080]   but hopefully a little bit less wrong every time.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.320]   - Exactly.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.880]   And I would bet the farm, as they say.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.920]   - Do you have a farm?
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.720]   - I say that much more seriously,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.280]   because not only do I have a farm,
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.620]   but we just renovated it.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.880]   (laughing)
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.640]   - That's a very serious statement.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.960]   - So before I renovated, betting at the farm,
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.200]   my wife and I spent five years renovating it.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.520]   - You were much looser with that statement,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.480]   but now it really means something.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.080]   - Now it really means something.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   And I would bet the farm on the guess
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:57.580]   that 100 years from now, string theory will be viewed
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.480]   as a stepping stone towards a greater understanding
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.980]   of nature.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.960]   And it would, I mean, another thing that I didn't mention
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.520]   about string theory is, of course,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   we knew that it solved the infinities problem,
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.560]   and then we later learned that it also solved
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   Hawking's puzzle about what's inside of a black hole.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.400]   And you put in one assumption, you get five things out,
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.200]   somehow you're doing something right.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.700]   Probably not everything, but there's some good signposts.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.920]   And there've been a lot of good signposts like that.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.080]   - It is also a mathematical toolkit, and you've used it.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.800]   You've used it with Kamran Vafa.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.520]   Maybe we can sneak our way back from string theory
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.600]   into black holes.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.320]   What was the idea that you and Kamran Vafa developed
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.160]   with the holographic principle and string theory?
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.400]   What were you able to discover through string theory
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.320]   about black holes?
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.000]   Or that connects us back to the reality of black holes?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.980]   - Yeah, so that is a very interesting story.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   I was interested in black holes
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.540]   before I was interested in string theory.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:19.540]   I was sort of a reluctance string theorist in the beginning.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.060]   I thought I had to learn it
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.760]   'cause people were talking about it.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.120]   But once I studied it, I grew to love it.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.420]   First, I did it in a sort of dutiful way.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.500]   These people say they've claimed quantum gravity.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.180]   I ought to read their papers at least.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.160]   And then the more I read them,
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.860]   the more interested I got, and I began to see.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.760]   They phrased it in a very clumsy way.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.220]   The description of string theory was very clumsy.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.860]   - Mathematically clumsy or just the interpretation?
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.260]   - Mathematically clumsy, yeah.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.040]   It was all correct, but mathematically clumsy.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   But it often happens that in all kinds of branches
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.360]   of physics that people start working on it really hard
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.000]   and they sort of dream about it and live it and breathe it.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.580]   And they begin to see inner relationships.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:17.320]   And they see a beauty that is really there.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.820]   They're not deceived.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.760]   They're really seeing something that exists.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.160]   But if you just kind of look at it,
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.240]   you can't grasp it all in the beginning.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.540]   So our understanding of string theory in 1985
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:42.380]   was almost all about
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:49.980]   weakly coupled waves of strings colliding and so on.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.380]   We didn't know how to describe a big thing
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.500]   like a black hole in string theory.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.020]   Of course, we could show that strings in theory
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.300]   at some limit reproduced Einstein's theory
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.240]   of general relativity and corrected it.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.360]   But we couldn't do any better with black holes
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   than before my work with Kuhnman,
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.740]   we couldn't do any better than Einstein
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.100]   and Schwarzschild had done.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.660]   Now, one of the puzzles,
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:29.340]   if you look at the Hawking's headstone
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:34.020]   and also Boltzmann's headstone and you put them together,
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.580]   you get a formula for,
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.420]   and they are really central equations
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.860]   in 20th century physics.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.520]   I don't think there are many equations
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.020]   that made it to headstones.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.100]   (both laughing)
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.380]   And they're really central equations.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.300]   And you put them together and you get a formula
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.320]   for the number of gigabytes in a black hole.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.480]   Now, in Schwarzschild's description,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.900]   the black hole is literally a hole in space
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.640]   and there's no place to store the gigabytes.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.140]   And it's not too hard to,
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.340]   and this really was Wheeler and Bekenstein,
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.340]   and Wheeler, Bekenstein, and Hawking
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:26.020]   to come to the conclusion that
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:32.020]   if there isn't a sense in which a black hole can store
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.580]   some large number of gigabytes,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:40.160]   that quantum mechanics and gravity can't be consistent.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.540]   - We gotta go there a little bit.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.220]   So how is it possible,
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.100]   when we say gigabytes, so there's some information,
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.580]   so black holes can store information.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.700]   How is this thing that sucks up all light
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.860]   and it's supposed to basically be super homogeneous
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.740]   and boring, how is that actually able to store information?
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.260]   Where does it store information?
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.140]   On the inside, on the surface?
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.240]   Where, where is, and what's information?
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.160]   I'm liking this ask five questions
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.220]   to see which one you actually answer.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.060]   - Oh, okay.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:11.900]   - I'm gonna ask you a question.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.420]   - So if you say that, I should try to memorize them
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.100]   and answer each one in order just to answer them.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.740]   - I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:21.180]   I'm desperately trying to figure it out as we go along here.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.180]   So Einstein's black holes,
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.060]   Schwarzschild's black hole, they can't store information.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.280]   The stuff goes in there and it just keeps flying
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.580]   and it goes to the singularity and it's gone.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.980]   However, Einstein's theory is not exact.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.160]   It has corrections.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:44.400]   And string theory tells you what those corrections are.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:50.860]   And so you should be able to find some way
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.860]   of some alternate way of describing the black hole
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:01.100]   that enables you to understand
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:05.060]   where the gigabytes are stored.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.020]   So what Hawking and Bekenstein really did
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.820]   was they showed that physics is inconsistent
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.820]   unless a black hole can store a number of gigabytes
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:24.820]   proportional to its area divided by four times
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.900]   Newton's constant times Planck's constant.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.300]   - And that's another wild idea.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.380]   You said area, not volume.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.900]   - Exactly.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.540]   And that's the holographic principle.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.220]   - The universe is so weird.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.620]   - That's the holographic principle.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.180]   - That's called the holographic principle,
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.740]   that it's the area.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.180]   We're just jumping around.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.380]   What is the holographic principle?
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.420]   What does that mean?
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.540]   Is there some kind of weird projection going on?
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.260]   What the heck?
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.300]   - Well, I was just before I came here
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.860]   writing an introduction to a paper
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.300]   and the first sentence was,
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:01.180]   the as yet imprecisely defined holographic principle.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.580]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.740]   So nobody knows exactly what it is,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:13.420]   but roughly speaking, it says just what we were alluding to
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:18.420]   that really all the information that is stored
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.740]   in some volume of space time can be stored
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.020]   on the boundary of that region.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.980]   - So this is not just about black holes,
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.740]   it's about any area of space time.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.660]   - Any area of space time.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.980]   However, we've made sense of the holographic principle
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.220]   for black holes.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.660]   We've made sense of the holographic principle
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.020]   for something which could be called anti-de Sitter space,
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:47.020]   which could be thought of as a giant,
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.860]   as a black hole turned into a whole universe.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:57.380]   And we don't really understand how to talk
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.500]   about the holographic principle for either flat space,
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.760]   which we appear to live in,
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.020]   or asymptotically de Sitter space,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.100]   which astronomers tell us we actually live in
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.860]   as the universe continues to expand.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.860]   So it's one of the huge problems in physics
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:26.340]   is to apply or even formulate the holographic principle
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:32.900]   for more realistic, well, black holes are realistic,
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.900]   we see them, but yeah, in more general context.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.500]   So a more general statement of the holographic principle.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.100]   - What's the difference between flat space
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.020]   and asymptotic de Sitter space?
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.980]   So flat space is just an approximation
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.500]   of the world we live in.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.780]   So de Sitter space, asymptotic,
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.940]   I wonder what that even means,
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.860]   meaning asymptotic over what?
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.460]   - Okay, so for thousands of years,
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.100]   until the last half of the 20th,
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.940]   well, sorry, until the 20th century,
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:10.420]   we thought space time was flat.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.060]   - Can you elaborate on flat?
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.660]   What do we mean by flat?
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:20.820]   - Well, like the surface of this table is flat.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.720]   Let me just give an intuitive explanation.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.740]   Surface of the table is flat,
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.420]   but the surface of a basketball is curved.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   So the universe itself could be flat
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.320]   like the surface of a table,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.640]   or it could be curved like a basketball,
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.460]   which actually has a positive curvature.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.260]   And then there's another kind of curvature
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.580]   called the negative curvature.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.820]   And curvature can be even weirder
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.380]   because that kind of curvature I've just described
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.640]   is the curvature of space,
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.740]   but Einstein taught us that we really live
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.180]   in a space-time continuum,
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.140]   so we can have curvature in a way
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.200]   that mixes up space and time.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.860]   And that's kind of hard to visualize.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.600]   - 'Cause you have to step, what, a couple of dimensions up,
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.960]   so it's hard to--
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.880]   - You have to step a couple,
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   but even if you have flat space
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.600]   and it's expanding in time,
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.880]   we could imagine we're sitting here,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.100]   this room, good approximation, it's flat,
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.680]   but imagine we suddenly start getting
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.180]   further and further apart.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.560]   Then space is flat,
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.520]   but it's expanding,
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.400]   which means that space-time is curved.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.680]   - Ultimately it's about space-time.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.600]   Okay, so what's the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter space?
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:49.800]   - The three simplest space-times are flat space-time,
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.360]   which we call Minkowski space-time,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.280]   and negatively curved space-time, anti-de Sitter space,
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.020]   and positively curved space-time, de Sitter space.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   Astronomers think that on large scales,
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.240]   even though for thousands of years we hadn't noticed it,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   beginning with Hubble,
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.940]   we started to notice that space-time was curved.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.840]   Space is expanding in time,
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.960]   means that space-time is curved.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.320]   And the nature of this curvature
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.960]   is affected by the matter in it,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:36.960]   because matter itself causes the curvature of space-time.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:42.520]   But as it expands, the matter gets more and more diluted.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.320]   And one might ask, when it's all diluted away,
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.880]   is space-time still curved?
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.100]   And astronomers believe they've done
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.560]   precise enough measurements to determine this,
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.480]   and they believe that the answer is yes,
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.580]   the universe is now expanding.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:07.580]   Eventually all the matter in it will be expanded away,
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:14.360]   but it will continue to expand because,
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.320]   well, they would call it the dark energy,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.200]   Einstein would call it a cosmological constant.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.120]   In any case, in the far future,
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.720]   matter will be expanded away,
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.200]   and we'll be left with empty de Sitter space.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.760]   - Okay, so there's this cosmological,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.920]   Einstein's cosmological constant
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.240]   that now hides this thing that we don't understand
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.120]   called dark energy.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.400]   What's dark energy?
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.040]   What's your best guess at what this thing is?
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.900]   Why do we think it's there?
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.200]   It's because it comes from the astronomers.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   - Dark energy is synonymous
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.680]   with positive cosmological constant.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:54.600]   And we think it's there
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:59.280]   because the astronomers have told us it's there,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.760]   and they know what they're doing.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.600]   - And we don't know what the heck it is.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.480]   - It's a really, really hard measurement,
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.000]   but they really know what they're doing,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.420]   and we have no friggin' idea why it's there.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.880]   Another big mystery.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.320]   Another reason it's fun to be a physicist.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.700]   And if it is there, why should it be so small?
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.900]   Why should there be so little?
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.920]   Why should it have hid itself from us?
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.960]   Why shouldn't there be enough of it
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:34.620]   to substantially curve the space between us and the moon?
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.560]   Why did there have to be such a small amount
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.640]   that only the crazy best astronomers
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   in the world could find it?
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.280]   - Well, can't the same thing be said
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.880]   about all the constants?
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.120]   All of the, can't that be said about gravity?
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.480]   Can't that be said about the speed of light?
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.060]   Like, why is the speed of light so slow?
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.100]   - So fast.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:57.940]   - So slow.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.900]   Relative to the size of the universe, can't it be faster?
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.000]   (laughing)
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.900]   Or no?
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.060]   - Well, the speed of light is a funny one
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.980]   because you could always choose units
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.060]   in which the speed of light is one.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.580]   You know, we measure it in kilometers per second,
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.420]   and it's 186,000, or miles per second,
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.580]   it's 186,000 miles per second.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.380]   But if we had used different units,
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.020]   then we could make it one.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.720]   But you can make dimensionless ratios.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.340]   So, you know, you could say,
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:38.720]   why is the time scale set by the expansion of the universe
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.900]   so large compared to the time scale of a human life,
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.140]   or so large compared to the time scale
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.220]   for a neutron to decay, you know?
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.020]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, ultimately,
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.160]   the temporal reference frame here is a human life.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   - Maybe.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.840]   - Isn't that the important thing for us,
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.280]   descendants of apes?
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.400]   Isn't that a really important aspect of physics?
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.800]   Like, because we kind of experience the world,
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.160]   we intuit the world through the eyes
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.240]   of these biological organisms.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.020]   - I guess mathematics helps you escape that for a time,
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.240]   but ultimately, isn't that how you wonder about the world?
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.280]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.760]   - That like a human life time is only 100 years?
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.460]   'Cause if you think of everything,
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.400]   if you're able to think in, I don't know,
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.860]   in billions of years,
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:32.260]   then maybe everything looks way different.
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.040]   Maybe universes are born and die,
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.200]   and maybe all of these physical phenomena
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.480]   become much more intuitive than we see
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.500]   at the grand scale of general relativity.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.720]   - Well, that is one of the,
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.800]   a little off the track here,
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.600]   but that certainly is one of the nice things
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.840]   about being a physicist is you spend a lot of time
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.760]   thinking about insides of black holes
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.440]   and billions of years in the future,
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.080]   and it sort of gets you away from the day-to-day
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.620]   into another fantastic realm.
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:12.160]   But I was answering your question
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.920]   about how there could be information in a black hole.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.080]   - Yes.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   So Einstein only gave us an approximate description,
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.400]   and we now have a theory that corrects it, string theory.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.760]   And now sort of was the moment of truth.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.800]   Well, when we first discovered string theory,
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.320]   we knew from the get-go that string theory
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.700]   would correct what Einstein said,
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.140]   just like Einstein corrected what Newton said.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:45.840]   But we didn't understand it well enough
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.360]   to actually compute the correction,
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.940]   to compute how many gigabytes there were.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:57.340]   And sometime in the early '90s,
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:02.240]   we began to understand the mathematics
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.880]   of string theory better and better,
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.520]   and it came to the point where it was clear
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.080]   that this was something we might be able to compute.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   And it was a kind of moment of truth for string theory
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.880]   because if it hadn't given the answer
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:27.120]   that Bekenstein and Hawking said it had to give
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.600]   for consistency, string theory itself
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.000]   would have been inconsistent
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.280]   and we wouldn't be doing this interview.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.920]   - Wow. (laughs)
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.320]   That's a very dramatic statement, but yes.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:43.520]   - That's not the most dramatic thing.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.920]   - I mean, okay, that's very life and death.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.240]   You mean like, because string theory
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.320]   was central to your work at that time.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.560]   Is that what you mean?
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.000]   - Well, string theory would have been inconsistent.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.400]   - Yeah, okay, so that'd be--
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.000]   - String theory would have been inconsistent.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.720]   - But those inconsistencies can give birth
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.200]   to other theories, like you said.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.000]   - The inconsistency, right, something else could have happened.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.560]   It would have been a major change
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.880]   in the way we think about string theory,
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.280]   and it was a good thing that one supposition
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.240]   that the world is made of strings solves two problems,
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.240]   not one, it solves the infinity problem
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.200]   and it solved the Hawking's problem.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   And also the way that it did it was very beautiful.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:39.160]   It gave an alternate description.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   So alternate description of things are very common.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:50.120]   I mean, we could, to take a simple example,
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.920]   this bottle of water here is 90% full.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.400]   I could say it's 90% full.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.560]   I could also say it's 10% empty.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.640]   Those are obviously the same statement.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.880]   And it's trivial to see that they're the same,
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.840]   but there are many statements that can be made
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.000]   in mathematics and mathematical physics
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.640]   that are equivalent, but might take years
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.040]   to understand that they're equivalent,
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.560]   and might take the invention or discovery
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.440]   of whole new fields of mathematics
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.600]   to prove they're equivalent.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.840]   And this was one of those.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.160]   We found an alternate description
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:34.680]   of certain black holes in string theory,
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.280]   which we could prove was equivalent,
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.960]   and it was a description of the black hole
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.920]   as a hologram that can be thought of, a holographic plate,
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.440]   that could be thought of as sitting on the surface
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:55.040]   of the black hole, and the interior of the black hole itself
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.480]   sort of arises as a projection,
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.480]   or the near horizon region of the black hole
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.160]   arises as a projection of that holographic plate.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.640]   So the two descriptions were the hologram,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.680]   the three-dimensional image, and the holographic plate.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.880]   And the hologram is what Einstein discovered,
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.200]   and the holographic plate is what we discovered.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:26.300]   And this idea that you could describe things
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.120]   very, very concretely in string theory
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.840]   in these two different languages, of course, took off
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   and was applied to many different contexts
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.960]   within string theory.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.080]   - So you mentioned the infinity problem
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.600]   and the Hawking problem.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.880]   Which Hawking problem?
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.760]   That the black hole destroys information,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.800]   or which Hawking problem are we talking about?
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.080]   - Well, there's really two Hawking problems.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.640]   They're very closely related.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.100]   One is, how does the black hole store the information?
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:08.060]   And that is the one that we solved in some cases.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:17.620]   So it's sort of like your smartphone,
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.200]   how does it store its 64 gigabytes?
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.540]   Well, you rip the cover off and you count the chips,
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.540]   and there's 64 of them, each with a gigabyte,
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.380]   and you know there's 64 gigabytes.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.900]   But that does not solve the problem
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.980]   of how you get information in and out of your smartphone.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:39.900]   You have to understand a lot more about the Wi-Fi
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.940]   and the internet and the cellular.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.900]   - That's where Hawking radiation, this prediction,
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.740]   it starts to--
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.060]   - That's where Hawking radiation comes in.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.160]   And that problem of how the information gets in and out,
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.500]   you couldn't have explained how information
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.380]   gets in and out of an iPhone without first explaining
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.980]   how it's stored in the first place.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.940]   - So just to clarify, the storage is on the plate?
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:09.940]   - Is on the plate.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.980]   - On the holographic plate,
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.140]   and then it projects somehow inside the--
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:18.100]   - The bulk, the space-time is the hologram.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.580]   - The hologram, but man, I mean,
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.540]   do you have an intuitive, when you sit late at night
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.580]   and you stare at the stars,
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.860]   do you have an intuitive understanding
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.820]   of what a holographic plate is?
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.580]   Like that there's two dimension,
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.720]   no projections that store information?
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.060]   - How a black hole could store information
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:47.820]   on a holographic plate, I think we do understand
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.340]   in great mathematical detail and also intuitively,
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.100]   and it's very much like an ordinary hologram
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.660]   where you have a holographic plate
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.380]   and it contains all the information,
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.940]   you shine a light through it,
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.900]   you get an image which looks three-dimensional.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.460]   - Yeah, but why should there be a holographic plate?
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.300]   - Why should there be?
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.500]   - Yeah, why?
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.020]   - That is the great thing about being
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:22.020]   a theoretical physicist is anybody can very quickly
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.460]   stump you with a going to the next level of whys.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.180]   - Yeah, the whys is kind of, ooh, I can just keep asking.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.540]   - Yeah, you could just keep asking
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.660]   and it won't take you very long to,
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.820]   so the trick in being a theoretical physicist
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.740]   is finding the questions that you can answer.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.060]   - Sure.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.620]   - So the questions that we think we might be able
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:49.100]   to answer now and we've partially answered
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:54.100]   is that there is a holographic explanation
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:59.420]   for certain kinds of things in string theory.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.300]   - Sure.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.860]   - We've answered that.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.100]   Now we'd like to take what we've learned
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.140]   and that's what I've mostly been doing
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.220]   for the last 15, 20 years.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.340]   I haven't really been working so much
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.780]   on string theory proper.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.500]   I've been sort of taking the lessons
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.260]   that we learned in string theory
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:22.260]   and trying to apply them to the real world
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:28.740]   assuming only what we know for sure about the real world.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.500]   - So on this topic, you co-authored a paper
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.300]   with Stephen Hawking called "Soft Hair on Black Holes"
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.860]   that makes the argument against Hawking's
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.760]   original prediction that black holes destroy information.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.820]   Can you explain this paper?
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.660]   - Yes.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.500]   - And the title?
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.600]   - Yeah, okay, so first of all,
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:54.180]   the hair on black holes is a word that was coined
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:59.500]   by the greatest phrase master in the history
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.780]   of physics, John Wheeler, invented the word black hole.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:08.580]   And he also said that, he made the statement
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.040]   that black holes have no hair.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.360]   That is, every black hole in the universe
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:21.040]   is described just by its mass and spin.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.000]   They can also rotate as was later shown by Kerr.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:34.560]   And this is very much unlike a star, right?
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   Every star of the same mass is different
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.940]   in a multitude of different ways.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.240]   Different chemical compositions,
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.400]   different motions of the individual molecules.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:55.040]   Every star in the universe, even of the same mass,
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.400]   is different in many, many different ways.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   Black holes are all the same.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.160]   And that means when you throw some,
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.020]   in Einstein's description of them,
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.800]   which we think must be corrected.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.560]   And if you throw something into a black hole,
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.680]   it gets sucked in.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   And if you throw in a red book or a blue book,
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.240]   the black hole gets a little bigger,
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.820]   but there's no way within Einstein's theory
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.720]   of telling how they're different.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.680]   And that was one of the assumptions
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   that Hawking made in his 1974, '75 papers,
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:48.780]   in which he concluded that black holes destroy information.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.600]   You can throw encyclopedias, thesis defenses,
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.480]   the Library of Congress.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.780]   - Doesn't matter, it's going to behave
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.560]   exactly the same uniform way.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.120]   - Yeah, so what Hawking and I showed,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.080]   and also Malcolm Perry,
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:10.780]   is that one has to be very careful
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:17.400]   about what happens at the boundary of the black hole.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.640]   And this gets back to something I mentioned earlier
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.680]   about when two things which are related
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.680]   by a coordinate transformation are and are not equivalent.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:36.060]   And what we showed is that there are very subtle imprints
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:41.260]   when you throw something into a black hole,
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.620]   there are very subtle imprints left
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.900]   on the horizon of the black hole,
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.740]   which you can read off at least partially what went in.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.640]   And so this invalidates Stephen's original argument
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:02.280]   that the information is destroyed.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.960]   - And that's the soft hair, those imprints.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.840]   - That's the soft hair, right.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.400]   So, and soft is a word that is used in physics
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.000]   for things which have very low energy.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.160]   And these things actually carry no energy.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.600]   There are things in the universe which carry no energy.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.280]   - You said, I think to Sean Carroll,
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.320]   by the way, everyone should go check out
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.560]   Sean Carroll's Mindscape podcast, it's incredible.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.320]   And Sean Carroll's an incredible person.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.200]   I think you said there, maybe in a paper, I have a quote.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.760]   You said that a soft particle is a particle
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:40.200]   that has zero energy, just like you said now.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.840]   And when the energy goes to zero,
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.600]   because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.200]   it's also spread over an infinitely large distance.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.320]   If you like, it's spread over the whole universe.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.760]   It somehow runs off to the boundary.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.720]   What we learned from that is that
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.120]   if you add a zero energy particle to the vacuum,
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.480]   you get a new state.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.320]   And so, there are infinitely many vacua,
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.320]   plural for vacuum, which can be thought of
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.080]   as being different from one another
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.840]   by the addition of soft photons or soft gravitons.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.500]   Can you elaborate on this wild idea?
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:21.920]   If you like, it spreads over the whole universe.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.120]   When the energy goes to zero,
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.440]   because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.600]   it also spreads over an infinitely large distance.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.280]   If you like, it's spread over the whole universe.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.080]   It's spread over the whole universe.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.360]   Can you explain these soft gravitons and photons?
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.520]   - Yeah, so the soft gravitons and photons
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:46.840]   have been known about since the '60s,
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.280]   but exactly what we're supposed to do with them
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.680]   or how we're supposed to think about them,
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:00.080]   I think, has been well understood only recently.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.960]   And in quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.020]   is proportional to Planck's constant times its wavelength.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.240]   So, when the energy goes to zero,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.960]   the wavelength goes to infinity.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   Now, if something has zero energy
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.240]   and it's spread all over the universe,
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.600]   in what sense is it actually there?
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.840]   That's been the confusing thing,
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.000]   to make a precise statement
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.880]   about when something is and isn't there.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.040]   Now, the simplest way of seeing,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.240]   so people might have taken the point of view
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.440]   that if it has zero energy
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.760]   and it's spread all over the universe,
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.620]   it's not there, we can ignore it.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:03.240]   But if you do this, you'll get into trouble.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.680]   And one of the ways that you'll get into trouble
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.600]   is that even though it has zero energy,
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.880]   it doesn't have zero angular momentum.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.400]   If it's a photon, it always has angular momentum one.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.480]   If it's a graviton, it's angular momentum two.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:26.600]   So, you can't say that the state of the system
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.840]   with the zero energy photon
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.280]   should be identified with the one
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.160]   without the zero energy photon,
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.360]   that we can just ignore them,
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.520]   because then you will conclude
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.840]   that angular momentum is not conserved.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.680]   And if angular momentum is not conserved,
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.080]   things won't be consistent.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:51.960]   And of course, you can have a lot of these things,
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.800]   and typically you do get a lot of them.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.820]   And when you, you can actually do a calculation
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:02.460]   that shows that every time you scatter two particles,
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.680]   you create an infinite number of them.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   - Infinite number of the soft photons and gravitons?
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.040]   - Of the zero energy ones, yeah.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.920]   - And so these are, and they're somehow everywhere.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.760]   - They're everywhere.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.360]   - But they also contain information,
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.200]   or they're able to store information?
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.840]   - And they're able to store information.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.120]   They're able to store an arbitrary
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.320]   large amount of information.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.840]   So, what we pointed out is,
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.400]   so what these things really do,
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.440]   one way of thinking of them is they rush off
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.560]   to the edges of the universe,
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.360]   spreading out all over the space.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.760]   It's like saying they rush off
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.520]   to the energy edge of the universe.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.880]   And that includes, if the interior of the black hole
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.800]   is not considered part of the universe,
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.900]   that includes the edge of the black hole.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:50.920]   So we need to set up our description of physics
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.600]   so that all the things that are conserved
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.560]   are still conserved in the way that we're describing them.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.920]   And that will not be true if we ignore these things.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.240]   We have to keep careful track of these things.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:07.880]   And people had been sloppy about that,
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.080]   and we learned how to be very precise and careful about it.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.120]   - And once you're being precise,
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.040]   you can actually answer this kind of very problematic thing
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.120]   that Hawking suggested, that black holes destroy information.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.760]   - Well, what we showed is that there's an error
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.040]   in the argument that all black holes are the same
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.600]   because they hadn't kept track of these,
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:35.120]   these very subtle things.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.160]   And whether or not this is the key error
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.440]   in the argument remains to be seen,
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.560]   or whether this is a technical point.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.440]   - Yes, but it is an error.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.480]   - It is an error.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.880]   - And Hawking obviously agreed with it.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.440]   - Hawking agreed with it, and he was sure that this was the,
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.400]   he was sure that this was--
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   - This was a critical error.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.760]   - That this was the critical error,
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.440]   and that understanding this would,
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.520]   would get us the whole story, and that could well be.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.400]   - What was it like working with Stephen Hawking
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.480]   on this particular problem?
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.080]   Because it's kind of a whole journey, right?
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.120]   - Well, you know, I love the guy.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.120]   He's so passionate about physics.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.880]   He just, yeah, his,
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.680]   his oneness with the problem,
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.440]   and I mean, it's--
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.760]   - So his mind is all occupied by the world that's--
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.400]   - Yeah, and let me tell you,
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.040]   there's a lot of other things,
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.280]   with his illness and with his celebrity,
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.000]   and a lot of other things.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.480]   - A lot of distractions pulling at his,
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.120]   at his mind, he's still there.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.320]   He's still right there. - That's right, that's right.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.080]   I remember him turning down tea with Lady Gaga
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.880]   so we could spend another hour on our paper.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.560]   (both laughing)
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.880]   - That, my friends, is dedication.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.520]   What did you learn about physics?
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.240]   What did you learn about life
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.320]   from having worked with Stephen Hawking?
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.840]   - Well, he was one of my great teachers.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.440]   Of course, he's older than me,
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   and I was reading his textbooks in graduate school,
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.080]   and I learned a lot about relativity from him.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.680]   I learned about passion for a problem.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.680]   I learned about not caring what other people think.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:49.480]   Physics is an interesting culture.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.800]   Even if you make a great discovery like Hawking did,
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.760]   people don't believe everything you say.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.480]   In fact, people love to disagree.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:08.440]   It's a culture that cherishes disagreement,
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.560]   and so he kept ahead with what he believed in,
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.800]   and sometimes he was right, and sometimes he was wrong.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.280]   - Do you feel pressure from the community?
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.720]   So, for example, with string theory,
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.440]   it was very popular for a time.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.520]   There's a bit of criticism, or it's less popular now.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.600]   Do you feel the forces of the community
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.920]   as it moves in and out of different fields,
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.240]   or do you try to stay, like how difficult is it
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.920]   to stay intellectually and mathematically independent
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.880]   from the community?
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.760]   - Personally, I'm lucky I'm well-equipped for that.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:54.520]   When I started out in graduate school,
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.000]   the problem of quantum gravity
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   was not considered interesting.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.480]   - You still did it anyway.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.440]   - I still did it anyway.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.960]   I'm a little bit of a contrarian, I guess,
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.920]   and I think that has served me well.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:18.160]   People are always sort of disagreeing with me,
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.520]   and they're usually right, but I'm right enough.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520]   - And like you said, the contradiction
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.560]   ultimately paves the path of discovery.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.360]   Let me ask you, just on this tension,
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.440]   we've been dancing between physics and mathematics.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.220]   What to you is an interesting line
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.960]   you can draw between the two?
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.400]   You have done some very complicated mathematics
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.800]   in your life to explore the laws of nature.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.800]   What's the difference between physics and mathematics to you?
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.640]   - Well, I love math.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.240]   I think my first love is physics,
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.460]   and the math that I've done, I've done to,
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.700]   because it was needed.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.960]   - In service of physics.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.480]   - In service of physics, but then, of course,
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   in the heat of it, it has its own appeal.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.160]   - In the heat of it, I like it, sure.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.760]   - It has its own appeal, and I certainly enjoyed it.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.060]   And ultimately, I would like to think,
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:24.060]   I wouldn't say I believe, but I would like to think
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.760]   that there's no difference between physics and mathematics,
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.760]   that all mathematics is realized in the physical world,
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:38.360]   and all physics has a firm mathematical basis,
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.720]   that they're really the same thing.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.320]   I mean, why would there be math
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:47.320]   that had no physical manifestation?
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.340]   It seems a little odd, right?
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.180]   You have two kinds of math,
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:54.260]   some that are relevant to the real world.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.580]   - Well, they don't have to be contradictory,
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.740]   but you can have, can't you not have mathematical objects
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.480]   that are not at all connected to the physical world?
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.780]   So, I mean, this is to the question
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.660]   of is math discovered or invented?
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:08.580]   So, to you, math is discovered,
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.780]   and there's a deep linkage between the two.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.100]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.020]   - Do you find at all compelling these ideas,
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.080]   like something like Max Tegmark,
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.880]   where our universe is actually
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.440]   a fundamentally mathematical object,
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.760]   that math is, our universe is mathematical,
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.760]   fundamentally mathematical in nature?
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.160]   - My expertise is a physicist
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.820]   doesn't add anything to that.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:40.840]   It's not really, you know, physics is,
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   you know, I was once very interested in philosophy,
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.280]   and, you know, physics,
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.680]   physics, I like questions that can be answered,
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.920]   that it's not obvious what the answer is,
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.320]   and that you can find an answer to the question,
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.080]   and everybody will agree what the answer is,
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.040]   and that there's an algorithm for getting there.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.880]   Not that these other questions aren't interesting,
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.160]   and they don't somehow have a way
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.160]   of presenting themselves,
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.860]   but to me, the interesting thing is to,
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:27.480]   is motion in what we know, is learning more,
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.160]   and understanding things
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.400]   that we didn't understand before,
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.080]   things that seemed totally confusing
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.440]   having them seem obvious, that's wonderful.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.320]   So, I think that those questions are there.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.440]   I mean, I would even go further, you know,
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.240]   the whole multiverse, I don't think there's too much
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.520]   concrete we're ever gonna be able to say about it.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.720]   - This is fascinating, because you spend so much time
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.720]   in string theory, which is devoid from a connection
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.200]   to the physical world for a long time,
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.680]   like, not devoid, but it travels in a mathematical world
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.880]   that seems to be beautiful and consistent,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.000]   and seems to indicate that it could be
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.960]   a good model of the laws of nature,
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.120]   but it's still traveling independently,
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.520]   'cause it's very difficult to experimentally verify,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.520]   but there's a promise laden in it,
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.280]   in the same way multiverse, or you can have a lot of kind of
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.600]   very far out there questions,
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.000]   where your gut and instinct and intuition says
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.080]   that maybe in 50, 100, 200 years,
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.960]   you'll be able to actually have
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:38.000]   strong experimental validation, right?
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.200]   - I think that with string theory,
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   I don't think it's likely that we could measure it,
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.400]   but we could get lucky.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.120]   In other words, just to take an example,
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.880]   about 10 or 20 years ago, it was thought that
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.920]   they had seen a string in the sky,
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:04.920]   and that it was seen by, you know,
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.000]   doubled stars that were gravitationally lensed
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.320]   around the gravitational field
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.920]   produced by some long string.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.520]   There was a line of double lensed,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.920]   now the signal went away, okay?
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.640]   But people were hoping that they'd seen a string,
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.280]   and it could be a fundamental string
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.120]   that somehow gotten stretched,
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.580]   and that would be some evidence for string theory.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.680]   There was also BICEP2, which,
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.880]   it was, the experiment was wrong,
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   but it could have happened.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.800]   It could have happened that we got lucky,
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.400]   and this experiment was able to make direct measurements.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.040]   Certainly would have been measurements of quantum gravity,
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.040]   if not string theory.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:51.800]   So it's a logical, it's a very logical possibility
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.960]   that we could get experimental evidence from string.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.600]   That is a very different thing than saying,
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.080]   do this experiment, here's a billion dollars,
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:02.940]   and after you do it,
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.480]   we'll know whether or not strings are real.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.600]   But I think it's a crucial difference.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.280]   It's measurable in principle,
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.280]   and we don't see how to get from here to there.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:21.840]   If we see how to get from here to there,
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.000]   in my eyes, it's boring, right?
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.540]   So when I was a graduate student,
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.600]   they knew how to measure the Higgs boson.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.000]   Took 40 years, but they didn't,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.480]   not to say that stuff is boring.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.400]   I don't want to say that stuff is boring.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.600]   But I, you know, when Magellan set out,
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.440]   he didn't know he could get around the world.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.600]   There was no map, you know?
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.680]   So I don't know how we're gonna
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.840]   connect in a concrete way
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.300]   all these ideas of string theory to the real world.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:04.360]   And, you know, when I started out in graduate school,
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:09.200]   I said, what is the most interesting problem
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.360]   that there might be, the deepest, most interesting problem
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:16.080]   that there might be progress on in 60 years?
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:22.560]   And I think it could be, you know,
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.320]   that, you know, in another 30 years,
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.160]   that maybe we'll learn that we have understood
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.980]   how black holes store information, you know?
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:35.500]   That doesn't seem wild,
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.260]   that we're able to abstract what we learned
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.460]   from string theory and show that it's operative.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.740]   And, you know, I mean, the Bose-Einstein condensate,
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.580]   they did, you know, when Bose and Einstein predicted it,
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:56.440]   when was that, the '30s maybe, early '30s?
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.020]   It took, there were 20 orders of magnitude
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.500]   that were needed in order to,
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:05.320]   an improvement in order to measure it,
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.540]   and they did, 50 years later.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.900]   So, and you couldn't have guessed how that had happened,
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.700]   how they could have gotten that.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.620]   And it could happen that we,
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:19.220]   I don't think we're gonna like see
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.980]   the heterotic string spectrum at an accelerator,
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:26.980]   but it could be that things come around
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:32.380]   and in an interesting way, and somehow it comes together.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:35.620]   And the fact that we can't see to the end
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:39.740]   isn't a reason not to do it, you know?
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.780]   We're just, you know, what did they do
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:44.780]   when they were trying to find the Pacific, right?
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.500]   They just, they took every route.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.420]   They just tried everything, and that's what we're doing.
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:52.340]   And we're taking, and I'm taking the one
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:56.060]   that my nose tells me is the best, you know?
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.780]   And other people are taking other ones, and that's good,
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:03.300]   because we need every person taking every route.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.900]   And, you know, if somebody on another route
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.980]   finds something that looks really promising,
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.420]   you know, I'm gonna make a portage over the mountain
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.660]   and get on their stream, you know?
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:19.660]   So, the fact that you don't see the experiment now
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:24.660]   isn't, to me, a reason to give up on what I view
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:29.660]   as the most fundamental paradox in 20th century,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.340]   20th, in present physics, 20, 21st century physics.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.580]   - Absolutely, you can see that it's possible.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.100]   You just don't know the way.
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.140]   But that's what I mean,
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.940]   why some of the philosophical questions could be formulated
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.540]   in a way that's explorable scientifically.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.500]   So, some of the stuff we've talked about,
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.100]   but, you know, for example,
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.460]   this topic that's become more okay to talk about,
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:54.340]   which is the topic of consciousness.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.460]   You know, to me, as an artificial intelligence person,
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.740]   that's a very practically interesting topic.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.500]   But there's also philosophers.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.740]   Sean Carroll loves to argue against them.
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.780]   But there's some philosophers that are panpsychists.
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:10.260]   - I'm not against philosophers, it's just not as fun.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.820]   I don't-- - It's not as fun, right.
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.260]   (both laughing)
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:18.260]   But they start a little flame of a fire going
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.380]   that some of those flames, I think,
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:23.500]   eventually become physics.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.620]   So, eventually become something that we can really,
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.300]   like, having them around is really important
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.420]   because you'll discover something by modeling
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.820]   and exploring black holes that's really weird.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.660]   And having these ideas around,
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.740]   like the ideas of panpsychists,
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.020]   that consciousness could be a fundamental force of nature.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.780]   Just even having that crazy idea,
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.660]   swimming around in the background,
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:49.540]   could really spark something where
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.700]   that you were missing something completely.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:56.300]   And it's just, that's where the philosophy done right,
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.620]   I think, is very useful.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.020]   That's where even the, you know, these thought experiments,
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:04.420]   which is very fun in sort of the tech sci-fi world
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.980]   that we live in a simulation,
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:11.180]   that, you know, taking a perspective of the universe
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.620]   as a computer, as a computational system
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.100]   that processes information,
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.040]   which is a pretty intuitive notion,
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.260]   but you can just even reframing it that way for yourself,
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:25.140]   could really open up some different way of thinking.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.140]   - Could be.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.260]   - And then you have, I don't know if you're familiar
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.780]   with Stephen Wolfram's work
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:32.860]   of like cellular automata and complexity.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.980]   - Yeah, I did a podcast with Stephen.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.260]   - With Stephen, that's awesome.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.320]   I mean, to me, forget physics, forget all that.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.500]   Cellular automata make no sense.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.340]   They're so beautiful.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.540]   They're so, that from simple rules,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.480]   you can create complexity.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.000]   I just don't think, you know,
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.040]   he wrote a book, "A New Kind of Science,"
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.680]   basically hinting at, which a lot of people have hinted at,
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.280]   is like, we don't have a good way
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.000]   to talk about these objects.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   We can't figure out what is happening here.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.920]   These simple, these trivial rules
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.960]   can create incredible complexity.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.920]   - He's totally right about that, yeah.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.460]   - And physicists, I guess, don't have,
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.360]   don't know what to do with that.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.440]   Don't know what to do with cellular automata,
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.620]   'cause you can describe the simple rules
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:20.440]   that govern the system,
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.840]   but how complexity can emerge, like incredible complexity.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.680]   - Yeah.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.140]   Of course, Wolfram's version of that
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:31.220]   is that physicists will never be able to describe it.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.900]   - Right, yeah, exactly.
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.300]   He tries to prove that it's impossible.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.380]   What do you make of that?
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:40.500]   What do you make about the tension of being a physicist
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.400]   and potentially not being able to,
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.460]   it's like Freud or somebody
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.900]   that maybe, Sigmund Freud,
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.720]   maybe you'll never be able to actually describe
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.740]   the human psyche.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:54.100]   Is that a possibility for you?
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.260]   That you will never be able to get to the core,
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.760]   fundamental description of the laws of nature?
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:05.040]   - Yeah, so I had this conversation with Weinberg.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.400]   (laughing)
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.840]   - Yeah, how'd it go?
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:14.940]   - So Weinberg has this book called "Dreams of a Final Theory."
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.260]   - Yeah.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.140]   - And I had this conversation with him.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.540]   I said, "Why do you think
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.700]   "there's ever gonna be a final theory?
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.420]   "Why should there ever be a final theory?
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.540]   "I mean, what does that mean?
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:28.260]   "Do physics departments shut down?
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.800]   "We've solved everything?"
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.960]   And, you know,
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.980]   doesn't it seem that every time
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.660]   we answer some old questions,
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:40.100]   we'll just find new ones
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.220]   and that it will just keep going on forever and ever?
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.580]   He said, "Well, that's what they used to say
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   "about the Nile.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.780]   "They were never gonna find the end."
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.140]   (laughing)
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.100]   Then one day they found it.
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:53.940]   - Yeah.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:55.320]   - So I don't know.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:58.540]   String theory doesn't,
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.940]   string theory doesn't look like a candidate to me
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.260]   for a final theory.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:08.180]   - As it stands now.
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.740]   It doesn't get to the bottom of the well
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.340]   and to the sides and to the whole thing.
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:14.620]   - Yeah, it seems to me that even if we kind of solved it
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.180]   and we did experiments,
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.780]   there still would be more questions,
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:21.540]   like why are there four dimensions instead of six?
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.700]   It doesn't seem to have anything in it
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.780]   that would explain that.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.980]   You can always hope, you know,
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.300]   that there's something that we don't know
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.940]   about string theory that will explain it,
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:35.100]   but it still doesn't look like
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:37.720]   it's gonna answer every question.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:42.080]   And why is there one time, not two?
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.800]   You know, why is there,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   you know, it doesn't seem like it's,
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.360]   I don't even know what it would mean
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.720]   to answer every question.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.480]   - Well, to answer every question, obviously,
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:55.520]   so when you refer to the theory of everything,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.760]   you'll be able to have a,
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.000]   if it exists, it would be a theory
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.640]   that allows you to predict precisely
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.680]   the behavior of objects in the universe
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.040]   and their movement, right?
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.760]   What about them, their movement?
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.600]   - Yeah.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.200]   - Like precisely, no matter the object.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.200]   - Right, that's true.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:19.040]   So that would be a really interesting state of affairs
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.080]   if we could predict everything
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:26.260]   but not necessarily understand everything.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:31.020]   So for example, let's just forget about gravity.
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.040]   I mean, we're not too far from that situation.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.080]   If we forget about gravity,
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.640]   the standard model, in principle,
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.480]   given a big enough computer,
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.280]   predicts almost everything.
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.240]   But if you look at the standard model,
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.760]   it's kind of a laundry list
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:53.360]   with neutrino masses and all that stuff.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.280]   There are hundreds of free parameters.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.700]   Where do they come from?
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.440]   Is there an organizing principle?
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.560]   Is there some further unification?
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.400]   - Sure.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.840]   - So being able to predict everything
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.520]   is not the only goal that physicists have.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.400]   - So on the way to trying to predict,
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.360]   you're trying to understand.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.320]   That's actually probably the goal is to understand.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.760]   - Yeah.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.800]   But right, we're more interested in understanding
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.080]   than actually doing the predictions
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.260]   but the predictions are more,
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:29.920]   focusing on how to make predictions
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:33.560]   is a good way to improve your understanding
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.120]   because you know you've understood it
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.520]   if you can do the predictions.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.000]   - Yeah, one of the interesting things
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.220]   that might come to a head with is artificial intelligence.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:47.800]   There's an increasing use of AI in physics.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.320]   We might live in a world where AI
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.520]   would be able to predict perfectly what's happening.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.800]   And so, as physicists, you'll have to come
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.640]   to the fact that you're actually
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.400]   not that interested in prediction.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.640]   I mean, it's very useful but you're interested
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.800]   in really understanding the deep laws of nature
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.000]   versus a perfect predictor.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:08.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:09.680]   - Like you wanna play chess.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.560]   - But even within AI, AI people are trying
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.880]   to understand what it is that the AI bots have learned
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   in order to produce whatever they produce.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.120]   - For sure but you still don't understand deeply
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.820]   especially because they're getting,
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:30.160]   especially language models if you're paying attention,
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.000]   the systems that are able to generate text,
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.200]   they're able to have conversations,
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.080]   Chad GPT is the recent manifestation of that.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.740]   They just seem to know everything.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.320]   They're trained on the internet.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.080]   They seem to be very, very good
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.520]   at something that looks like reasoning.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.120]   They're able to generate, you can ask them questions,
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.080]   they can answer questions.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.320]   It just feels like this thing is intelligent.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.520]   And I could just see that being possible with physics.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.240]   You ask any kind of physical question
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.240]   and it'll be able to, very precise
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   about a particular star system or a particular black hole.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.200]   It'll say, well, these are the numbers you see.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.240]   It'll perfectly predict and then sure,
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.440]   you can understand how the neural network is,
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.840]   the architecture is structured.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.240]   Actually, for most of them now, they're very simple.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.120]   You can understand what data is trained on,
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.200]   huge amount of data.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.680]   You're getting a huge amount of data
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.200]   from a very nice telescope or something.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.640]   And then, but it seems to predict everything perfectly.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.400]   How a banana falls when you throw it.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.400]   Everything is perfectly predicted.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.980]   You still don't have a deep understanding
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.580]   of what governs the whole thing.
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.720]   And maybe you can ask it a question.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.220]   It'll be some kind of Hitchhiker's Guide
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.700]   to the Galaxy type answer.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:46.440]   It's a funny world we live in.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.340]   Of course, it's also possible that there's no such deep,
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.100]   simple governing laws of nature.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.540]   Behind the whole thing.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:57.060]   I mean, there's something in us humans--
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:57.900]   - It's possible.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.980]   - That wants it there to be.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:00.820]   - Yeah.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:01.660]   - But doesn't have to be, right?
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:02.500]   - Right.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:06.340]   - I do, again, you're betting, you already bet the farm.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:08.620]   But if you were to have a second farm,
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.260]   do you think there is a theory of everything
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.100]   that we might get at?
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.840]   So, simple laws that govern the whole thing.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:20.540]   - I don't, I don't, honestly, I don't know.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:25.380]   But I'm pretty confident that if there is,
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.560]   we won't get to it in my lifetime.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.200]   I don't think we're near it.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:31.380]   - But doesn't it feel like there,
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:33.940]   like the fact that we have the laws we do,
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.300]   they're relatively simple already.
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.580]   That's kind of incredible.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.420]   It's just, there seems to be,
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:42.760]   there seems to be simple laws that govern things, right?
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:46.220]   - By a theory of everything, you mean a theory of,
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.420]   of everything, an algorithm to predict everything.
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:54.500]   - But a simple algorithm.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:58.060]   - A relatively simple algorithm to predict everything.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.220]   So, for me, it would be a sad day
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:04.580]   if we arrived at that without answering
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.040]   some deeper questions.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.820]   - Sure, of course, it definitely is.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.900]   But the question, yes.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:14.580]   But one of the questions before we arrive there,
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.820]   we can ask, does such a destination even exist?
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:23.060]   Because asking the question and the possible answers
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.340]   in the process of trying to answer that question
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.320]   is in itself super interesting.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.020]   Is it even possible to get there,
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.620]   where there's an equals mc squared type of,
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:36.820]   there's a function, okay, you can have many parameters,
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:39.900]   but a finite number of parameter function
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:42.300]   that can predict a lot of things about our universe.
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:47.140]   - Well, okay, but just to sort of throw one thing in,
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:50.180]   in order to answer every question,
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.340]   we would need a theory of the origin of the universe.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:59.980]   And that is a huge task, right?
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:05.060]   And the fact that the universe seems to have a beginning
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:09.040]   defies everything we know and love, right?
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:14.040]   Because one of the basic principles of physics
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.640]   is determinism, that the past follows from,
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.280]   the present follows from the past,
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:25.420]   the future follows from the present, and so on.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:29.120]   But if you have the origin of the universe,
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.000]   if you have a Big Bang, that means before that,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.560]   there was nothing.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.160]   You can't have a theory in which
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.860]   something follows from nothing.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:38.520]   So somehow--
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.620]   - Sounds like you don't like singularities.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.220]   - Well--
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.600]   - I thought for somebody that works with black holes,
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:45.800]   you would get used to them by now.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.440]   - No, no, I like this because it's so hard to understand.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.120]   I like it 'cause it's hard to understand,
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.600]   but it's really challenging us.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.400]   It's not a, I don't think we're close
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.480]   to solving that problem.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.320]   - So even--
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.440]   - And string theory has basically had nothing,
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:06.400]   there's been almost nothing interesting said about that
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.080]   in the last many decades.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.880]   - So string theory hasn't really looked at the Big Bang,
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.160]   it hasn't really tried to get to the origin.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.760]   - Not successfully, not, there aren't compelling papers
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.460]   that lots of people have read that,
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.840]   people have taken it up and tried to go at it,
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.360]   but there aren't compelling.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.800]   String theory doesn't seem to have a trick
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.180]   that helps us with that puzzle.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.440]   - Do you think we'll be able to sneak up
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.320]   to the origin of the universe, like reverse engineer it,
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   from experimental, from theoretical perspective?
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:47.680]   Okay, if we can, what would be the trajectory?
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.200]   - You've already gotten yourself in trouble,
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:53.160]   'cause you used the word reverse engineer.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.640]   So if you're gonna reverse engineer,
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   that means you, forward engineering means
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:03.200]   that you take the present and determine the future,
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.100]   reverse engineering means that you take the present
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:07.340]   and determine the past.
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:10.860]   - Yeah, estimate the past, but yes, sure.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:13.660]   - But if the past was nothing,
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:16.620]   how are you ever gonna reverse engineer to nothing?
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:18.780]   That's hard to do.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:20.460]   - Run up against the nothing, right?
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:23.740]   Until, have mathematical models that break down nicely
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:26.140]   to where you can actually start to infer things.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:32.220]   - Let's work on it.
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.400]   - No, but do you think that--
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.240]   - Maybe, but people have tried to do things like that.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.200]   - Yeah, and have not succeeded.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.120]   - It's not something that we're getting A pluses in.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.320]   - Sure, let's pretend we live in a world
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.480]   where in 100 years we have an answer to that.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:54.360]   What would that answer look like?
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.180]   What department is that from?
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:00.200]   What fields led us there?
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.380]   Not what fields, what set of ideas in theoretical physics?
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:07.680]   Is it experimental, is it theoretical?
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.120]   Like what can you imagine possibly
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.440]   could have possibly led us there?
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.700]   Is it through gravitational waves
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.400]   and some kind of observations there?
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.520]   Is it investigation of black holes?
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.840]   Is it simulation of universes?
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.880]   Is it maybe we start creating black holes somehow?
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.720]   I don't know.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.980]   Maybe some kind of high energy physics type of experiments?
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:33.980]   - Well, I have some late night ideas about that
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:36.140]   that aren't really ready for prime time.
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.640]   - Okay, sure.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.860]   But you have some ideas.
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:42.800]   - Yeah, yeah, and many people do.
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.540]   It could be that some of the advances
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:49.140]   in quantum information theory are important
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:54.140]   in that they kind of go beyond taking quantum systems
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.820]   and just replicating themselves
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:59.380]   but combining them with others.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.980]   - Do you think, since you highlighted the issue
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:06.060]   with time and the origin of the universe,
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.940]   do you think time is fundamental or emergent?
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:12.660]   - I think ultimately it has to be emergent.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:16.320]   - Yeah, what does it mean for time to be emergent?
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:22.940]   - Well, let's review what it means for space to be emergent.
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:27.100]   What it means for space to be emergent
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:32.100]   is that you have a holographic plate
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:37.980]   and you shine some light that's moving in space
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:41.900]   and it produces an image
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:45.100]   which contains an extra spatial dimension
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:47.380]   and time just goes along for the ride.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:53.560]   So what we'd like to do,
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:57.180]   and indeed there is some rather concrete work
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.200]   in this direction, though again, I would say
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.040]   even within our stringing community,
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:04.940]   we're not getting A pluses on these efforts.
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:09.660]   But what we'd like to do is to see
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:17.720]   examples in which the extra space-time dimension is time.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:23.440]   In other words, usually what we understand very well
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.800]   mathematically is how to take systems
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:34.120]   in some number of space-time dimensions
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:39.120]   and rewrite them as a plate in fewer space dimensions.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.640]   What we'd like to do is to take systems
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.920]   with one time and some number of space dimensions
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.220]   and to rewrite them as a system
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.640]   that had only space dimensions in it,
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.160]   had no time evolution.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.040]   And there's some fairly concrete ideas
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:00.700]   about how to do that, but they're not universally accepted
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:04.140]   even within the stringy community.
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:07.840]   - But isn't it wild to you?
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:08.680]   - Yes.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.000]   - For it to be emergent?
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.900]   - Yes. - How do we intuit
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.760]   these kinds of ideas as human beings
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.000]   for whom space and time seems as fundamental
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:17.840]   as apples and oranges?
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.680]   - Well, they're both illusions.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:20.640]   - Okay.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.880]   - They're both illusions.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.120]   Even time.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.760]   - You co-authored a paper titled
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.520]   Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.460]   First of all, whoever writes your paper titles,
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:38.660]   you like the soft hair and the term black hole
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.360]   and the big bang, you're very good
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.920]   at coming up with titles yourself.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.800]   Anyway, you co-authored a paper titled
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:46.160]   Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.640]   In it you write, quote, "Recent work has identified
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.000]   "a number of emergent symmetries
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.520]   "related to the intricate self-similar structure
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.720]   "of the photon ring."
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.360]   So what are photon rings?
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.320]   What are some interesting characteristics of a photon ring?
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:02.240]   - So that was a paper with Dan Kopitz
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.160]   and Alex Lipsaska that just came out.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:10.920]   And this paper is kind of a wonderful example
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:17.040]   of what happens when you start to talk to people
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:21.920]   who are way out of your comfort zone
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.920]   of no different stuff and look at the world a different way.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.400]   And some two or three years ago,
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:35.440]   I'm part of this, the Black Hole Initiative,
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.320]   I'm also part of this Event Horizon Telescope collaboration
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:43.320]   that took the famous, though I had nothing to do
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:48.120]   with the experiment, but that took the famous picture
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.120]   of the donut of M87, and through conversations with them,
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:46:00.920]   which started out in an effort to understand
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:04.600]   the image that they'd seen.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.760]   So it's a great thing for somebody like me,
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.680]   a theoretical physicist, lost, seemingly lost
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.680]   in string land to be presented with an actual picture
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.320]   of a black hole. - And asked what?
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.320]   - To be asked, what can we learn from this?
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:30.320]   So with some help from Michael Johnson, Alex Lipsaska,
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:38.320]   and a bunch of other people, Event Horizon collaboration,
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.560]   we came up with a fantastic, beautiful answer
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:48.560]   using Einstein's theory that is both shaping the future of,
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:57.680]   now it is shaping the future of improved
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.040]   black hole photographs, what do you wanna concentrate on
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.160]   in the photograph?
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.680]   You know, you just point it at the sky and click?
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:06.560]   No, you don't do that.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.240]   You optimize for various features.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.240]   And it's both shaping that, and in the process
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:22.320]   of talking to them and thinking about how light behaves
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:27.320]   around a black hole, black holes just have so many
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.200]   magic tricks and they do so many weird things.
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:35.120]   And the photon ring is among the weirdest of them.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.920]   We understood this photon ring, and in the process of this,
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:44.920]   we said, hey, this photon ring has gotta be telling us
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:51.920]   something about the puzzle of where the holographic plate is
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:59.880]   outside of a ordinary astrophysical black hole.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.180]   And we nailed it for the stringy black holes,
[01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:06.960]   but they have a somewhat different character.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.640]   - What's a stringy black hole?
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.480]   The black holes that describe a string theory?
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:13.280]   - The black holes that are contained in string theory
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.640]   and they have different structure in them.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.760]   - Well, but actually, can we step back?
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.080]   So what was the light in the image taken in 2019?
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.760]   No, not taken in 2019, presented in 2019.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:26.000]   - So here's the puzzle.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.320]   What they really saw, so the black holes tend to gather
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:36.540]   stuff that swirls around it.
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:41.780]   And they don't know what that stuff is made of,
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:44.220]   they don't know what its temperature is,
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:45.980]   they don't know what kind of magnetic fields
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:48.360]   there are around there.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.360]   So the form of the image has a lot of unknowns in it
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.580]   that it's dependent on many other things
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:59.180]   other than the geometry of the black hole.
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:05.180]   So most of what you're learning is about the stuff.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.600]   Now the stuff, the swirling stuff,
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.100]   the hot swirling stuff is interesting as hell,
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:18.020]   but it's not as interesting as the black hole,
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:21.080]   which are the most, in my view,
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.640]   the most interesting things in the universe.
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.000]   So you don't wanna just learn about the stuff,
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.840]   you wanna learn about the black hole
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.120]   that it's swirling around.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:34.800]   - So one of the, at the very first step,
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.720]   at the very primitive level,
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:39.240]   this is just a big leap for human civilization
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.300]   to be able to see a black hole,
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.480]   and the way you can see it
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.680]   is because there's stuff around it.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.440]   But you don't get to learn much about the black hole,
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.960]   but you get to learn more about the stuff
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.000]   just from the image.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.920]   - Yeah, but you're not gonna learn about the details
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.320]   before you've even seen it.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.560]   - 'Cause there's too many parameters,
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.480]   there's too many variables that govern the stuff.
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:06.480]   - Yeah, so then we found a very wonderful way
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.120]   to learn about the black hole,
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.580]   and here's how it works.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:13.700]   A black hole is a mirror,
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:18.040]   and the way it's a mirror is if light,
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.040]   a photon, bounces off your face
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.720]   towards the black hole,
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.600]   and it goes straight to the black hole,
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.800]   just falls in, you never see it again.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.040]   But if it just misses the black hole,
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:36.240]   it'll swing around the back and come back to you,
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.760]   and you see yourself from the photon
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.400]   that went around the back of the black hole.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.780]   But not only can that happen,
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:49.760]   the black hole, the photon can swing around twice
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.000]   and come back, so you actually see
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.780]   an infinite number of copies of yourself.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:58.960]   - Like with a little bit of a delay.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:01.000]   - With a little bit of a delay, right.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.560]   - This is awesome.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:06.920]   - Yeah, and in fact--
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.360]   - I mean, we're not used to an object
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.040]   that bends light like that, right?
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:10.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:13.000]   - So you're gonna get some trippy effects.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.560]   - And in fact, one of my students
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:18.960]   has made a really awesome computer animation of this,
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:22.040]   which I'm gonna show at a public lecture
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.640]   in a couple weeks where the audience
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.920]   will see infinitely many copies of themselves.
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.020]   That's all swirling around the black hole.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:36.320]   So a black hole is like a hall of mirrors,
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.880]   like an apartment store where you go
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.780]   and there's the three mirrors
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:42.180]   and you see infinitely many copies of yourself.
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.280]   Think of the black hole as the mirror.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.980]   And you go in there with your clothes.
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:51.100]   If you wanna know about your clothes,
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.540]   you just look at the direct image.
[01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:53.700]   You're not learning anything
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:56.140]   about the configuration of mirrors.
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:02.020]   But the relation of the image you see in front of you
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:07.660]   to the one you see at the side
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:11.740]   and the next one and so on depends only on the mirrors.
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.800]   It doesn't matter what clothes you're wearing.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:18.900]   So you can go there 1,000 times wearing different clothes,
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:21.940]   but each time there will be the same relation
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:23.780]   between the subsequent images.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:29.740]   And that is how we're gonna learn about the black holes.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:34.660]   We're gonna take the stuff that is swirling around
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:39.180]   and we're gonna tease out the subsequent images
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.380]   and look at their relation.
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.180]   And there's some very beautiful,
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.820]   really beautiful mathematics,
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:48.340]   which we were surprised to realize
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:52.380]   with the volumes and volumes of papers
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:55.220]   on black holes and their properties,
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:58.820]   this particular, 'cause it was a physical question
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.580]   that had never been asked in exactly this way.
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.380]   - So basically you're looking at the--
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:06.580]   - The relation between the subsequent images.
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:08.380]   - But those are ultimately formed by photons
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:09.860]   that are swirling around.
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:11.140]   - Photons that are orbiting.
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:15.140]   So the photon ring are the photons that orbit around.
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:17.620]   - And beyond, so like orbit and lose orbit.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:22.300]   Like are they, like so, wow.
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:23.380]   And that starts to give you,
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.540]   what can you possibly figure out mathematically
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.380]   about the black hole?
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:27.860]   Can you, the geometry of it?
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:30.740]   Does the spin of it? - The geometry, the spin.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:35.740]   And you can verify things behaving.
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:40.980]   We have never seen a region of space-time
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.660]   with such high curvature.
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:46.920]   I mean, the region around a black hole is crazy.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.820]   It's not like in this room.
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:51.020]   The curvature is everything.
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:52.700]   - You spend probably enough time with the math
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.300]   and the photons.
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:57.460]   Can you put yourself in that space?
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.420]   So we're like having a conversation
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:02.060]   in pretty peaceful, comfortable, flat space.
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.420]   Are you able to put yourself in a place
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.780]   around a black hole?
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.780]   - Yeah, I'm able to imagine that kind of thing, yeah.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:11.920]   So for example, and actually there's a wonderful movie,
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:14.140]   Interstellar.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:20.180]   And in that movie, you know, Kip Thorne,
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:24.000]   of course is a great theoretical physicist,
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.000]   experimental, who later won the Nobel Prize for LIGO.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.560]   And that movie is very accurate scientifically.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.520]   And there's some funny statements in there
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:43.840]   that of the, you know, 100 million people
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:47.500]   who saw that movie, there can't be more than 10 or 20
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:51.140]   understood about why Matthew McConaughey
[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:55.300]   is ejecting the trash in a certain direction in order to.
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:59.900]   But you know, for example, if I were a spinning black hole
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:02.520]   right here, if I was spinning fast enough,
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:05.200]   you wouldn't be able to stay still there.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.820]   You'd have to be orbiting around like that, you know?
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:11.380]   You'd have to have your microphone on a rotating--
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:13.500]   - Yeah, but I wonder what the experience is
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.480]   with the actual experience,
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.500]   'cause I mean, space itself is curved.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:19.100]   - Well, if space gets very curved, you get crushed.
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:23.420]   You know, body gets ripped apart,
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:25.460]   'cause the forces are different on different parts of the--
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:27.460]   - Sure, okay, so that would be--
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:29.020]   - But if it can be less curved,
[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:31.380]   so that the curvature is very noticeable,
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:32.860]   but you're not ripped apart.
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:39.420]   - The fact that this was just nonchalantly stated
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:41.620]   is just beautiful.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.940]   Like two biological systems discussing
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:46.780]   which level of curvature is required
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:49.940]   to rip apart said biological system.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:50.780]   Very well.
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:53.820]   So you propose in the paper that a photon ring
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.940]   of a warped black hole is indeed part
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:57.480]   of the black hole hologram.
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:01.860]   A photon ring of a warped black hole
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.800]   is indeed part of the black hole hologram.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.580]   So what can you intuit about the hologram?
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:16.580]   And the holographic plate from looking at the photon rings?
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:24.740]   - Well, this paper is exploring a new idea.
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:30.060]   It's not making a new discovery, so to speak.
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:39.860]   It's exploring an idea and the ins and outs of it,
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:44.540]   and what might work and what might not.
[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:48.580]   And this photon ring, somehow everybody always thought
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.540]   that the holographic plate sat at the horizon
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:52.640]   of the black hole.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:57.540]   And that the quantum system that describes the black hole
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:59.060]   is inside the horizon.
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:05.380]   And in fact, we think it's plausible,
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:13.500]   and we give some evidence in some soluble examples,
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:16.740]   in this case, in an example in one lower dimension
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:19.280]   where we can handle the equations better,
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:23.660]   that the quantum system that describes the black hole
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:28.300]   should correspond to a region of space-time
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:30.860]   which includes the photon ring.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:32.700]   So it's bigger.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:36.980]   - So that would be the holographic plate.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.380]   - That would be the holographic plate.
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:39.740]   - All of that.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:41.720]   - I mean, we didn't prove this.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:47.500]   We put it out there.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:50.700]   It hadn't really been considered previously.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:55.460]   We put it out there, and it does seem more plausible
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:58.860]   than the idea that it sits literally at the horizon.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.100]   And it is a big outstanding problem
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:07.260]   of how you have a holographic reconstruction
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.280]   of black holes like M87.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:15.660]   - Do you think there could be further experimental data
[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:17.740]   that helps explore some of these ideas
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:21.660]   that you have for photon rings and holographic plates
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:24.660]   through imaging and through high and high resolution images
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.820]   and also just more and more data?
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:28.180]   - I wish so, but I don't think so.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:32.420]   But what I think already has happened
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:36.100]   and will continue to happen is that the,
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:42.420]   there are many different ways that theorists
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:45.720]   and observers can interact.
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:51.900]   The gold standard is the theorist makes a prediction,
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:55.500]   the observer measures it and confirms it,
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:00.340]   or the observer makes a discovery
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:01.940]   and the theorist explains it.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.860]   But there's a lot less than that,
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:10.300]   which is really kind of the bread and butter of,
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:13.040]   those are dramatic moments when that happens, right?
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.300]   Those are once in a lifetime moments when that happens.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:18.780]   But the bread and butter is more when,
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:21.520]   and it has already happened,
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:22.900]   they came to us and said,
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:25.380]   "What is the interesting theoretical things
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:30.380]   "we can understand in this swirl around the black hole?"
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:35.740]   And we give an answer and then that in turn jogged us
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:42.060]   to think about the holographic principle
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:46.300]   in the context of M87 a little bit differently.
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.900]   And so it's a useful, and in the same vein,
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.520]   it's useful to talk to the philosophers
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:55.280]   and it's useful to talk to the mathematicians
[01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:00.060]   and a lot of, you gotta,
[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:02.460]   we just gotta, we don't know where we're going,
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.860]   we just gotta do everything.
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.020]   - Let me ask you another sort of
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:10.720]   philosophical type question, but not really actually.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.260]   It seems that thought experiments are used,
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:16.160]   so it's not just mathematics that makes progress
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.340]   in theoretical physics, but thought experiments do.
[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:20.640]   They did for Einstein as well.
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.300]   They did for a lot of great physicists throughout history.
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:26.300]   Over the years, how's your ability
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:27.540]   to generate thought experiments?
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:30.780]   Or just your intuition about some of these weird things
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:35.780]   like quantum mechanics or strength theory
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:40.040]   or quantum gravity or yeah, even general relativity,
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.060]   how's your intuition improved over the years?
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.980]   Have you been able to make progress?
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:48.980]   - The hard part in physics is most problems are
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.860]   either doable, most problems that a theoretical calculation
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:01.820]   that a theoretical physicist would do,
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:06.720]   there's no end of problems whose answer is uninteresting.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.500]   Can be solved, but the answer is uninteresting.
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:17.700]   There's also no end of problems that are very interesting,
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:21.660]   some of which you've asked me,
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.820]   but we don't have a clue how to solve them.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:29.460]   And when first presented with a problem,
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:31.560]   almost every problem is one or the other.
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:35.360]   It's the jackpot when you find one
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:36.760]   that isn't one or the other.
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.860]   And--
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:41.460]   - It seems like there's a gray area between the two, right?
[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:44.000]   That's where you should be looking.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.900]   - Well, I wouldn't describe it as a gray area.
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:47.760]   I would describe it as a knife edge.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.180]   - So it's a very small area.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:55.140]   - There isn't like a huge area with a sign.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.420]   Here lie problems that are doable
[02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:59.060]   and people wanna know the answer.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.740]   - And that's in some deep sense,
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.680]   that's where timing is everything with physics,
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.180]   with science, with discovery.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.100]   - With timing.
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:07.420]   I mean, I think earlier in my career,
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:12.420]   I erred more on the side of problems that were not solvable.
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:17.900]   - The ambition of youth.
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:19.980]   - Yeah.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:24.060]   - What made you fall in love with physics at first?
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:27.220]   If we can go back to the early days.
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:30.500]   You said black holes were there in the beginning.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.020]   But what made you, do you remember
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:33.940]   what really made you fall in love?
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:36.500]   - You know, I wanted to reach nirvana
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.580]   and I sort of realized that wasn't gonna happen.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:41.780]   And then after that, I wanted to know the meaning of life
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:45.720]   and I realized I probably wasn't gonna figure that out.
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.720]   And then I wanted to understand justice
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:57.100]   and socialism and world things
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:02:59.980]   and couldn't figure those out either.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.220]   (laughing)
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:05.020]   - Smaller and smaller problems
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:06.580]   until you arrived at black holes.
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.580]   - And then, I mean, most of this stuff
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.060]   I'm talking about adolescence,
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:14.580]   but it was the biggest problem
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:18.940]   that I thought that there was a prospect of,
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.980]   but not 100%, you know?
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:25.340]   And I was definitely ready to spend my life
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:31.300]   in the wilderness knocking my head against the wall,
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:34.460]   but I haven't had to.
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:36.380]   I haven't solved them,
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:39.300]   but I've said enough interesting things
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:42.660]   that you're interviewing me.
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:44.220]   So I'm not in the wilderness,
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.140]   but yeah, so.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:48.020]   - Do you remember the early days?
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:51.020]   Do you feel nostalgic when you think back
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:54.100]   to the ideas, the circumstances that led down,
[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:58.180]   that led you down the path towards black holes,
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:00.740]   towards theoretical physics, towards the tools of physics,
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:02.420]   towards this really fascinating world
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:03.580]   of theoretical physics?
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:09.300]   - Well, I wouldn't add nostalgia to it
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.260]   because
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:15.260]   (silence)
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:17.580]   it's not like a,
[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:23.380]   you know, a summer in Italy or something.
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:28.380]   It's like there's results that are there,
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:35.400]   that people are, and that's what's so gratifying.
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:41.500]   I mean, of course one's name disappears from these things,
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:46.540]   unless you're Einstein or Newton or something.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:51.740]   People are not gonna remember my name in 50 years.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:54.380]   - Well, most, basically every name will be forgotten
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:56.060]   in hundreds of years, yeah.
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:56.900]   - Yeah.
[02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.580]   - Are you able to, by the way,
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:03.140]   love the idea, the exploration of ideas themselves
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:05.100]   without the names, the recognition, the fame?
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:05.940]   - Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:10.260]   I have not, I hope someday, but I have not,
[02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:15.180]   there are some experiments now to verify
[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:20.180]   some of my predictions about properties of gravity
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.260]   and so on, but I have not.
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:28.900]   Most of what I've done is in the,
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:31.380]   it could happen still.
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:33.720]   It's still a logical possibility that everything
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.180]   having to do with string theory and,
[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:40.580]   I mean, as we mentioned, I'm betting the farm
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:44.700]   that it's not, but it is indeed a logical possibility
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:48.860]   that people will say, "Can you believe
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:53.060]   "Lex Fridman interviewed Elon Musk in Kenya West,
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:55.700]   "and then he interviewed Strominger,
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:05:59.200]   "who was working on this theory
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.080]   "that just completely went into the,
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.020]   "completely went into the toilet?"
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:06.420]   - I'm gonna make, I'm gonna get,
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:07.740]   with a wife I don't have, I'm gonna make
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:09.420]   a public statement, she'll be on stage,
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.020]   I'll say, "I'm really sorry I made this giant mistake
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:17.440]   "of platforming this wild-eyed physicist
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.520]   "that believed for decades in the power
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:20.440]   "of theoretical physics."
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:22.700]   Yes, no, like you said.
[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:25.580]   - So that could happen, it could happen, it could happen.
[02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:28.660]   And of course, if that couldn't happen,
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:30.780]   it wouldn't be real exploration, right?
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:32.100]   - Absolutely.
[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:37.100]   - And so, but I, you know, I do take a lot of satisfaction
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:41.260]   that some of the things I discovered
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:45.020]   are at the minimum mathematical truths,
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:49.080]   and they're still, so you don't have that sort of
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:54.080]   nostalgic feeling of it being something that was gone,
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:58.980]   and I'm still making discoveries now
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:01.460]   that I'm as excited about.
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:05.020]   We'll see if they hold the test of time,
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:09.700]   that stand the test of time that these other ones did,
[02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:13.900]   but that I'm as excited about as I was about those
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:16.140]   when I made them.
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:18.860]   I am easily excitable, as my friends will tell you.
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:20.620]   - Well, one interesting thing about you is--
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:22.180]   - And I have been very excited about things
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:24.180]   which turned out to be completely wrong, you know?
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:26.540]   - Well, that's, the excitement is a precondition
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:30.860]   for breakthroughs, but you're also somebody,
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:33.700]   like you said, you don't have a cynical view
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:36.060]   of the modern state of physics.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:36.940]   - No.
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:38.500]   - So there's a lot of people that glorify
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:39.820]   the early days of string theory,
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.180]   and all the discoveries that were made in the '20s.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:43.580]   - Yeah, people are always, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:48.580]   - But you're saying this to you might be one of,
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:51.780]   if not the most exciting times to be a theoretical physicist.
[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:55.740]   Like when the alien civilizations, 500 years from now,
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:57.820]   that visit Earth will look back,
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.780]   they'll think the 21st century,
[02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:01.180]   some of the biggest discoveries ever
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:02.020]   were made in the 21st century.
[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:04.140]   - Yeah, I mean, when they have a measurement
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.880]   of string theory, the fun's over.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:10.380]   Then we have to go on to something new, you know?
[02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:12.820]   - No, there's deep, there's going to be deep,
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:14.260]   the fun is over.
[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:15.860]   Oh, man.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:17.420]   But there is an end to the Nile, right?
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:18.380]   I mean, there's--
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:19.220]   - Is there?
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:21.340]   Who told you?
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:24.320]   - Some Weinberg guy.
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.960]   (laughing)
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:29.080]   - Let me ask you another trippy out there question now.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.960]   So again, perhaps unanswerable from a physics perspective,
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:38.760]   but do you wonder about alien civilizations?
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:42.440]   Do you wonder about other intelligent beings out there
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.040]   making up their own math and physics,
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:45.560]   trying to figure out the world?
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.120]   Do you think they're out there?
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:53.160]   - It is hard to understand
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.360]   why there would, given that there's so many planets,
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.960]   and of course there's Drake's formula,
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.720]   and we don't exactly know what the,
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:04.880]   but I mean, I think Fermi's paradox,
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.560]   that, you know, is a real paradox,
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.560]   and I think there probably are,
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:16.640]   and I think it's very exciting that,
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:23.040]   you know, we might, you know, find some,
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:26.600]   it's a logical possibility that we could learn about it.
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:28.480]   - I mean, to me, it's super interesting to think about
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.840]   aliens from a perspective of physics,
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:33.280]   because, so any intelligent civilization
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.360]   is going to be contending with the ideas,
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:39.280]   or just trying to understand the world around it.
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:43.600]   So I think that the universe is filled
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.180]   with alien civilizations.
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:47.500]   So they all have their physicists, right?
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:48.680]   They all have their,
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.760]   they're all trying to understand the world around them.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:52.160]   And it's just interesting to me
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.240]   to imagine all these different perspectives,
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:55.760]   all these different Einsteins.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:56.600]   - Yeah.
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:57.440]   - Like trying to make sense of like--
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.600]   - Though they might be more different than we think.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.440]   - What, why--
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:02.260]   - They might be different in a way
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.800]   that we haven't even thought of.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.960]   - Like smarter or different?
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:09.240]   - Just different, something that we don't even,
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:11.720]   we're not even able to describe now.
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:13.720]   We just haven't thought of it, you know?
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:16.440]   - Yeah, yeah, this is a really frustrating thing
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:19.280]   when we think, from me as an AI person,
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.820]   you start to think about what is intelligence,
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:25.000]   what is consciousness, and you start to sometimes,
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.740]   again, like evening thoughts is
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:31.320]   how little we understand,
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.700]   how narrow our thinking is about these concepts.
[02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:35.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:38.840]   - That it could be intelligence,
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:42.200]   could be, something could be intelligent
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:46.240]   and be very different, intelligent in a very different way.
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:47.800]   It won't be able to detect
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:50.960]   because we're not keeping an open mind,
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:54.040]   open enough mind, and that's kind of sad
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:56.840]   because to me there's also just a strong possibility
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.840]   that aliens or something like alien intelligence
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.840]   or some fascinating, beautiful physical phenomena
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:10.320]   are all around us, and we're too dumb to see it for now,
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.860]   or too closed-minded to see it.
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:16.620]   There's something we're just deeply missing,
[02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:18.680]   whether it's fundamental limitations
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:20.240]   of our cognitive abilities
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:23.520]   or just because our tools are too primitive right now.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:26.440]   Or like the way we, it's like you said,
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.840]   the idea seemed trivial once you figured it all out,
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.080]   looking back.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:32.960]   - Yeah.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.640]   - But that kind of makes me sad
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.320]   because there could be so much beauty in the world
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:41.960]   we're not seeing 'cause we're too dumb.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.400]   - There surely is.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.540]   And that's, I guess, the process of science and physics
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:48.480]   is to keep exploring, to keep exploring,
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.040]   to find the thing that will in a century seem obvious.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.980]   - Well, it's something we know for sure.
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:59.720]   I mean, the brain we don't really understand,
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:04.720]   and that's gotta be some fabulously beautiful story.
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.180]   - I'm hoping some of that story will be written
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:10.920]   through the process of trying to build a brain,
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:14.060]   so the process of engineering intelligence,
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:15.680]   not just the neuroscience perspective
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:18.640]   of just looking at the brain, but trying to create it.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:25.060]   But yeah, that story hasn't been written almost at all,
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:27.240]   or just the early days of figuring that one out.
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:29.220]   But see, like you said that math is discovered,
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:34.220]   so aliens should at least have the same math as us, right?
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:36.880]   - I think so.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.200]   - Maybe different symbols?
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:41.240]   - They might have discovered different,
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.600]   they might have discovered it differently,
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:47.600]   and they might have had a different idea
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.280]   of what a proof is.
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.040]   - Sure, yeah.
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.000]   We're very like black and white with the proof thing.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.080]   Maybe they're looser?
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:04.460]   - Right, well, so you can know something is true.
[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:08.120]   First of all, you never know something is true
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.800]   with 100% uncertainty.
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:14.200]   I mean, you might have had a blackout,
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.440]   just to be, it's never 100%, right?
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.240]   You might have had a momentary lapse of consciousness
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:21.760]   as the key step in the proof,
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:24.400]   and nobody read it, and whatever.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:26.040]   Okay, so you never know for sure.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:32.280]   But you can be, you have a preponderance of evidence,
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:37.200]   which makes it, and preponderance of evidence
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:42.240]   is not accepted very much in mathematics.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:47.240]   And that was sort of how the famous Ramanujan work.
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.920]   He had formulas which he guessed at,
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:54.960]   and then he gathered a preponderance of evidence
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:58.000]   that he was sure they were true.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.480]   So there might be, or something completely different.
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:03.300]   They might function in a very different way.
[02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:07.840]   - Let me ask you kind of a heavy question for a physicist,
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:10.920]   but one on nuclear weapons.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.400]   Just in general, what do you think about nuclear weapons
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:16.080]   where, like philosophical level,
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:20.100]   where brilliant physicists and brilliant engineering
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:23.080]   leads to things that can destroy human civilization?
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:27.120]   Sort of like some of the ideas that you're working on
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:34.240]   have power when engineered into machines, into systems.
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:36.440]   Is there some aspect of you that worries about that?
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.520]   - I don't know what the brilliant had to do with it,
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.920]   because of course, Oppenheimer and all that,
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:43.320]   okay, they did it really fast,
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:45.860]   but if you didn't have Oppenheimer,
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:49.020]   I mean, it would all have happened anyway.
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:53.440]   It had a reality of its own.
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.640]   The possibility of making a nuclear,
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:57.800]   it didn't depend on the fact that the physicists
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:58.960]   who built it were brilliant.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.160]   Maybe that sped it up by a year or two years,
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:05.480]   but by now we'd have nuclear weapons.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:06.800]   It's something that--
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:11.040]   - So the ideas have momentum, that they're unstoppable.
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.120]   - Right, the possibility of making nuclear weapons
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:17.340]   was discovered, right?
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:19.240]   It was there before.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.820]   It's not like somebody made it, right?
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:31.020]   Without Picasso, there would never have been a Guernica,
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:33.920]   but without Oppenheimer, there would surely
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.920]   have still been an atom bomb.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:38.400]   - But timing matters, right?
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:39.560]   Timing's very important.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:41.040]   There's a guy with a mustache--
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.740]   - Of course, of course, of course.
[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:45.940]   The timing mattered there.
[02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:53.000]   But I, yeah, okay, I mean,
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000]   you could try to make a case for stopping--
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.100]   - No, no, no, no, it's the case of carrying the burden
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:04.180]   of the responsibility of the power of ideas
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:06.880]   when manifested into systems.
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:09.220]   So it's not a game.
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:11.660]   It's not just a game of fun mathematics.
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:13.160]   Just same with artificial intelligence.
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:15.720]   You have this, a lot of people in AI,
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:20.300]   in a lot of people in the AI community,
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:22.360]   it's a fascinating, fun puzzle,
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.140]   how to make systems more and more intelligent,
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:26.240]   how to, you have a bunch of benchmarks,
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:27.980]   you try to make them perform better and better and better,
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:30.200]   and all of a sudden, you have a system
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:33.180]   that's able to outsmart people.
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:35.920]   It's now able to be used in geopolitics.
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:38.740]   It's able to create super intelligent bots
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:40.780]   that are able to, at scale,
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:43.180]   control the belief of a population of people.
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:44.860]   And now you can have world wars.
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:47.780]   You can have a lot of really risky instabilities--
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:49.540]   - They're incredible, they really are incredible.
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:53.100]   - And so, there's some responsibility.
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:58.100]   This is not sort of, it's a beauty and a terror to these ideas
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:00.980]   and a terror to these ideas, you know?
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:03.240]   - Yeah.
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:08.240]   At that moment, it was certainly a question for Oppenheimer
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:10.560]   and everybody who participated in that.
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.560]   What is the responsible way to serve society
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:20.800]   when you're sort of accidentally in this position
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:25.640]   of being at the forefront of a development
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:27.640]   that has a huge impact on society?
[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:33.500]   I don't see my work a likelihood of having a huge impact
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:36.780]   on the development of society itself,
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:38.400]   but if I were you--
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:40.620]   - Oh, I love this.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:45.420]   - Working on AI, I think that there is a possibility there,
[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:49.100]   and that it is, as a responsible scientist,
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:52.540]   that it's really not a good thing to say,
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.020]   I'm just the scientist here
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:56.660]   and I'm figuring out what's possible,
[02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:01.660]   because you're in a role where you have more of a podium
[02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:09.340]   to influence things than other people,
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:14.340]   and it's your responsibility as a citizen of the planet,
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:22.460]   or let me phrase it a little less shooty,
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:25.560]   it's, you have an opportunity,
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:26.680]   - Yeah.
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:30.240]   - as a citizen of the planet to make the world
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:34.400]   a better place, which it would be sad to bypass.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.160]   - Yeah, it's a nice world we got going.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:40.500]   It'd be nice to keep it going for a little bit longer.
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:43.480]   Andrew, I'm really honored that you sat down with me.
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:45.560]   This is, thank you for your work, thank you for your time.
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:48.120]   - Well, it was a really great conversation.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:49.240]   I really enjoyed it.
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:52.000]   You really covered a lot.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.480]   I can't believe you're able to discuss at this level
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:00.520]   on so many different topics, so it's a pleasure.
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.180]   - It was super fun, thank you.
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:04.560]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:06.000]   with Andrew Strominger.

[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:12.120]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.120]   from Werner Heisenberg.
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:18.580]   Not only is the universe stranger than we think,
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:21.580]   it is stranger than we can think.
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:25.400]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:27.980]   (upbeat music)
[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.560]   (upbeat music)
