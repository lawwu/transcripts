[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   The following is a conversation with Jocko Willink,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.800]   a retired US Navy SEAL, co-author of "Extreme Ownership,"
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.840]   "Dichotomy of Leadership," "Discipline Equals Freedom,"
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.760]   and many other excellent books.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.040]   And he's the host of Jocko podcast.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.440]   Jocko spent 20 years in the SEAL teams.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.520]   He was the commander of SEAL Team 3's task unit, Bruiser,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.400]   that became the most highly decorated
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640]   special operations unit of the Iraq War.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.440]   This conversation was intense and to the point.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.400]   We agreed to talk again, probably many times.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.120]   And what I find very interesting,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   aside from the talk of leadership,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.720]   is the conversation about military tactics
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.240]   of specific battles in history.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.120]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.360]   Linode, Indeed, SimpliSafe, and Ground News.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.440]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.280]   Since it's the 4th of July, a holiday in the United States,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.800]   let me say a few words about what this country, my country,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.720]   the United States of America means to me.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.440]   First, by way of background,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.760]   I was born and raised in the Soviet Union,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.520]   just long enough to get a bit of the Russian soul,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.280]   an appreciation of Soviet history, music, culture,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880]   of wrestling and mathematics, of engineering and philosophy,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.040]   stoicism and humor, tragedies and triumphs
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.640]   of war and revolutions,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640]   all in ways that are uniquely Russian.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.480]   I do happen to at times mention that I'm Russian.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.360]   This is what I mean, that I got a bit of that Russian soul.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   But of course, who I really am is an American.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.480]   This country gave me the opportunity,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.360]   the freedom to become and to be who I am,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   to stand as an individual.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.840]   This seemingly simple freedom to be a sovereign human being
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.920]   in the face of all the beauty and cruelty of life
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.960]   is why I love this country.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.320]   Much of life can be unfair, unjust, even tragic,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280]   but this is the country where if I'm clever enough,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.000]   work hard enough, and just get lucky enough,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.840]   I have a chance to dream big and make my dream a reality.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.640]   The United States welcomed me, my family,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.120]   and millions of immigrants throughout its history
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.760]   so that we can make something meaningful of ourselves,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.640]   to love, to dream, to create, to find joy and meaning.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.800]   It lets me be the weird kid I am,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   who wears a suit, talks about love,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.560]   and has a fascination with robots.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.400]   I know some people these days have an aversion to pride
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120]   and love for their country.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.200]   I don't.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.760]   I love America.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.480]   I also love humanity.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.720]   I believe these two, patriotism and humanism,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.640]   are not in conflict, much like loving your family
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.200]   and loving your country are not in conflict.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800]   They are all manifestations of the human spirit,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.760]   longing to strive for a better world.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.040]   I was born a Russian, but I believe I will die an American,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.640]   a proud American.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.920]   Hopefully not too soon, but life is short.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.880]   I already had one hell of a fun journey,
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.560]   so I'm ready to go when it's time.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.280]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.700]   and here is my conversation with Jocko Willink.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.440]   Is it tragic or beautiful to you
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.560]   that some of the closest bonds that are formed
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.400]   between people are through war often?
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.160]   - I think it's both.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.760]   Both tragic and beautiful, and for the obvious reasons.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   - What are the obvious reasons?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.420]   Why is it so obvious?
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.380]   - Well, it's tragic because a lot of people die,
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.160]   and it's beautiful because you form bonds with people
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.920]   that are very difficult to break
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.400]   once you've been through them.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.120]   - What is it about the trauma of war
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.880]   that makes bonds difficult to break?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.920]   - Because what you realize when you're in a war
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.760]   is that the people that are next to you,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.940]   you rely on them, and they're relying on you to survive.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.280]   And without them, you will not survive.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.520]   And when you realize that you need to work together
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   as a team to live, that forms a very strong bond.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.360]   - And there's nothing like that team
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.560]   outside of the realm of war?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.520]   - I don't know because there's a lot of things
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520]   that I haven't experienced in my life,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   but I think the pressure and the consequences of war,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.840]   there could be similar situations in survival scenarios,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   in various atrocities where people need to work together
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.320]   in order to survive, and I think you could probably
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.640]   get something that was similar.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.040]   - There's a very particular nature to the kind of war
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.240]   that World War II was, especially for the Soviet Union,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.200]   where it didn't just influence the lives of people,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.240]   it created culture, the music, the poetry, the literature.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.960]   It's in the way people think,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.600]   it's in the way people see the world,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.840]   it's in the way they talk even still to this day.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   And of course, I was talking about
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.140]   the directly relationship between two soldiers,
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.500]   but there's something about the depth of human connection
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   that results from this, almost like reverberations of war.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.120]   Like generations later, you're still close to other humans.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.300]   There's a coldness towards other humans in Russia,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.720]   but once you open up, it's depth,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.920]   you seek depth of connection
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.440]   versus like breadth of career kind of thinking,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.960]   how can I make friends with this
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.320]   so I can move into this direction?
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.200]   What can this person benefit me?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.120]   Instead, you seek a depth of human connection
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.520]   and appreciation that brings a lot.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.040]   And maybe I'm romanticizing war here,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.660]   but it feels like that's inextricably connected
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.960]   to World War II for Russians.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.800]   Does that resonate at all?
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.760]   - So if you look at military training,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.420]   what they do is they take people in the military
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.600]   from the civilian world, they bring them into the military
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.960]   and they put them through bootcamp,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.720]   which is the stereotypical thing that you see on TV.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.640]   You're gonna get yelled at, you're gonna get screamed at,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.080]   you're gonna get put in the mud
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.840]   and you're gonna be made to do hard things together.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.080]   And what does that do with those civilians?
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   Well, it gives them a common background.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.500]   It gives them a common suffering
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.480]   that they've been through together.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.800]   And they form some sort of connection, some sort of bond.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.200]   Now, to make that bond a little bit stronger,
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.500]   after you get done with bootcamp,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.020]   they send you to advanced infantry school
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.160]   and you suffer some more together.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.360]   And when you suffer more together,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.640]   now you're in a smaller group too,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440]   'cause now it's infantry, it's not supply people anymore,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.920]   or logisticians, it's strictly people
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.900]   that are going to fight, they're infantrymen.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.120]   So they go through school together
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.680]   and now they get a little bit tighter.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.760]   Get done with that and maybe you go to an airborne division,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.260]   so you go to airborne school
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.020]   and now you all overcome this fear
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.520]   of jumping out of an airplane together
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.680]   and you celebrate surviving that.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.000]   Then maybe you get done with that
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   and now you go at an airborne division,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.800]   now you're an even tighter group
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.240]   'cause you've suffered together.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.360]   What comes next is special forces training
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.320]   or ranger training.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.400]   And what they do is they put you in these situations
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.080]   where you're going to suffer together
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.440]   and you're going to build these bonds
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.520]   because as I said earlier,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.320]   you have to rely on each other to survive.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.560]   And by the way, not everyone does,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.840]   not everyone makes it through this training.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.040]   So you sort of have these memories
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   of people that didn't make it.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.320]   You share that connection as well.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.120]   And you can keep going down this road
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.160]   until you go into combat with a military unit.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.080]   And military units that go through combat
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.560]   have an even tighter bond.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.360]   And the harder the combat that they go through,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.680]   the tighter the bond is going to be.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.000]   So I think when you talk about
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.240]   what the Soviet Union went through in World War II,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.600]   there was a shared suffering to survive.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.720]   And so the entire nation has that common thread.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.640]   And that's probably the thing that you sense or feel
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.760]   when you refer back to the bond
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.280]   that resonates all the way back to World War II.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.560]   - So in your podcast and your writing,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.800]   you talk about some of the most fascinating things
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.600]   I listen to talk about in terms of military conflict
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.480]   is tactics and sort of the details of combat.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.360]   But allow me to stick on World War II for a second.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.280]   There's a particular aspect to that war,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.040]   I don't know if you can speak to it,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.160]   where twice the number of civilians
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.000]   died than military personnel.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.600]   So the Soviet Union especially.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.540]   My grandfather was a machine gunner in Ukraine
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.520]   as the Germans were marching towards Moscow.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.680]   There's this important push in 1941
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   where they were trying to get before the winter to Moscow.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.640]   And what Stalin was doing is he was basically
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.640]   throwing bodies to slow the attack.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.960]   And what that meant is everybody understood
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.800]   that your job was, you have this heavy machine guns,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.960]   it's almost unreasonable to be able to be mobile
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.280]   in any kind of way with them.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.580]   So you're thrown at the front
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.600]   and you're just nonstop shooting.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   And 95 plus percent of people are just dead,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.640]   of the soldiers are just dead.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.560]   And then you just go back and back.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.080]   And you're trying to protect as many civilians
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.920]   as you can throughout this whole process, but you don't.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   And so you have millions of civilians
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.880]   that die along the way into this march.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   Is there something you could say about this complete,
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.280]   perhaps it's naive of me to say,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   but a war that lacks tactics, that lacks strategy,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:42.840]   and is purely about just no consideration of human life
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   and just throwing bodies and bullets
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.000]   into a mix together where millions die.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.840]   And that in particular felt much less like conflict
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.260]   and much more like torture or suffering.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.400]   It didn't come off as torture,
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.120]   only that interestingly enough, as you probably know,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.720]   my grandfather, including everybody else, volunteered.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   They were proud to do this.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.320]   They were proud to march to their death for country,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.520]   for love of country.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.720]   But the question on the civilian side,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.640]   when more civilians die than military personnel,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.880]   what do you make of that?
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.760]   - It's awful.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.000]   It's awful when a soldier dies.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.180]   It's awful when a civilian dies.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.600]   It's awful when 10 civilians or 10 soldiers,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.080]   and it's even more awful when millions and millions
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.860]   of soldiers and civilians die.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.200]   I think it's safe to say that the Soviet Union
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.160]   was facing an existential threat to their existence
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   against the Nazis.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   So to not fight would be to die as well,
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.040]   maybe die a death a few years later,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.400]   maybe die a different way,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   but the choice was die now, trying,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.360]   or die later on your knees.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.220]   And I think the choice was pretty clear
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.460]   as far as the tactics go.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.220]   I mean, this is attrition warfare.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.180]   That's what that is.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.640]   We are going to keep, you said throwing bodies
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.300]   at the problem, that's attrition warfare.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.420]   And the Soviet Union had a lot of bodies,
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.300]   more than the Germans.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   And when you fight with attrition warfare,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.120]   whoever has more men and material will eventually win.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.120]   It's an awful way, but that's what the strategy was.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.740]   - You often talk about leadership.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.700]   Let's put the evils of Hitler aside.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.660]   The boldness of Hitler in making some
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.900]   of the strategic decisions he did was considered
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.980]   by many military historians quite brilliant
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.980]   early in the war, or insane and brilliant.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.500]   Stalin, on the other hand, I think universally is seen
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.380]   as somebody who is terrible military strategist,
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.140]   especially early in the war.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.660]   He did not see all the possible trajectories
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.060]   that the war could take.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.940]   Is there something you could say
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.980]   about failure of leadership?
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.660]   Stalin, also the United Kingdom before Churchill,
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.220]   and also FDR on the United States side,
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.220]   who basically was trying to turn a blind eye
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.820]   to everything that was happening over there
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.060]   with a perspective of we just want to make,
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   we wanted to keep America's interest as the primary interest
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.220]   and everything else let other countries
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.820]   work out their problems.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.340]   - You know, I think one of the things with Hitler
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.620]   was in the beginning of the war,
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.460]   he listened to his advisors, he listened to his generals,
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.820]   and therefore they did pretty well with that.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.220]   I think as the war went on,
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.380]   he believed that he was smarter than he was
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.520]   and made decisions that were bad,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.360]   that cost him dearly.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.820]   You know, I mean, case in point, as everyone knows,
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.120]   going and attacking the Soviet Union
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.860]   while you're still fighting a war on the other front
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.740]   is not a good move.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.140]   There's an example of, yeah, bad leadership,
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.660]   letting your ego get in the way,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.420]   believing that you can do things
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.480]   that are beyond your capabilities.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.040]   But, you know, as you mentioned in the beginning
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.020]   with Blitzkrieg, those were really dynamic and bold moves,
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.220]   and they worked.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.660]   And what does that do?
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.540]   That fuels your ego and makes you think that you can win.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.280]   - Many people consider that war a just war.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.140]   What do you think makes a just war?
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.920]   - I think you have the Nazis and the Imperial Japanese
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.460]   trying to impose their will
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.860]   on other nations and other peoples.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.700]   And when that happens, I think on a grand scale,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.700]   people look at that and believe it's just to step in
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.220]   and do something about it.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.140]   - Is there some gray area here?
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.520]   - There's nothing but gray area.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.300]   - The United States has been involved
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.180]   in a lot of military conflicts since then.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.620]   How do you draw the line to the gray area?
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.220]   What war should we engage in and not?
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.760]   I know you don't get into politics much,
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.180]   but the decision to go to war.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.300]   - You have to look at the situation that you're going into
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   and you have to make sure that you have
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.900]   the will to go to war.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.980]   And the will to go to war means that
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.380]   you are willing to kill people.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.380]   And when I say people, I don't just mean enemy
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.140]   because in war, civilians are going to die,
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.620]   women and children are going to die.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.100]   A lot of people are going to die.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.860]   And you are going to kill them.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.580]   Doesn't matter what kind of smart munitions you have,
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.960]   doesn't matter how disciplined your soldiers are.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.700]   When you go into a war, civilians are going to die
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.700]   and you have to understand that.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.340]   And the other thing that you have to understand is that
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.120]   your troops are also going to die.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.440]   And it seems like sometimes we're a little bit naive
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.000]   about the calculation of what that's going to look like.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.140]   And maybe we think, well, not that many civilians
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.620]   and maybe not that many of our personnel are going to die.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.760]   And that's where you get into sticky situations.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.320]   And another thing, when you were talking about
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:05.320]   the Soviet Union versus the Nazis, that's total war.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.160]   That's what that is.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.440]   And we don't engage in that very often.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.500]   It's total war.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.300]   It's we will do absolutely anything to win.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.440]   And America doesn't fight like that very often.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.480]   In fact, the last time we fought like that was World War II.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.780]   It was total war.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.560]   We will do whatever it takes to up to and including
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.140]   the atomic bomb to destroy the enemy.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.840]   So those are the kind of things you need to think about
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.240]   before you go to war.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.680]   And I don't think we think about that very often.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.040]   - Even the United States, the atomic bomb, nuclear weapons
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.480]   is an interesting one because there's a lot of,
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:49.000]   there's a lot of hesitation on that.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.700]   There's a lot of critics of that decision
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.700]   as it was happening.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.220]   So even America, you can imagine other countries
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.220]   like Germany would not be so hesitant
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.620]   to use nuclear weapons.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.100]   It's interesting to think about
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:10.180]   in deciding military strategy to inject ethics into it,
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.940]   into morality, it's not just about winning the war,
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.180]   but should we do this?
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.360]   And doing the calculation of human life.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.780]   Usually those decisions are made by leaders,
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.320]   not by the soldier that's going to be implementing
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.660]   that decision.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.600]   Do you put some responsibility, I should even say blame,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.740]   on the leaders in not doing that kind of calculation here?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.960]   You could say that about the Vietnam War,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.040]   you could say that about even the war
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.500]   that you were involved with in Iraq.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.220]   Is there some criticism here that you could apply to leaders
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.500]   for failing not to consider the broader moral questions?
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.060]   - Yes.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:05.700]   - Natural, like all leaders will make these mistakes,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.160]   or should leaders not make these mistakes?
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.660]   - Leaders are going to make mistakes.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.580]   It's impossible to know what's gonna happen in war
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.260]   just like it's impossible to know what's gonna happen
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.140]   in life.
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.500]   You make decisions based on the information
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.940]   that you have at the time.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.080]   And you will make mistakes.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.440]   And if you fail to admit that you made a mistake,
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.620]   that's where I have a more significant problem
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.020]   than someone that makes a mistake and says,
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.780]   "Hey, this is the mistake that I made.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.540]   "This is the intelligence that I thought we were utilizing,
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.080]   "and it actually is not what I thought it was going to be.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.260]   "And here's the new direction that we're going in."
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.260]   We don't have enough of that type of ownership
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.240]   in leadership globally.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.300]   - Just saying I made a mistake
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:05.360]   that resulted in a loss at scale of human life,
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.080]   being able to say that.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.000]   - And when you don't say that,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.640]   you end up with a more loss of human life.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.300]   - Can I ask you about the loss of human life?
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.520]   How does killing a human being change you?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.140]   What does it mean to kill a human being?
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.380]   What does it feel like to kill a human being?
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.780]   - Well, I mean, I guess you'd have to look
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.860]   at what circumstances a person's in
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.140]   when this is taking place.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.100]   If you've got someone that's in a fit of rage
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.740]   that goes and kills somebody,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.560]   they're going to come out of it and think,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.080]   "Wow, I've just really messed up."
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   If you've got someone that is a sociopath,
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.100]   they're not going to feel anything,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.080]   and that person deserved to die, and that's why they died.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.300]   If you've got a soldier who feels like
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.500]   they're trying to protect their friends,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.760]   they'll move through that.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.480]   If you've got a soldier that's doing it
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.840]   because they want some kind of personal glory,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.240]   they'll probably not feel good about it later.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.320]   So I think it depends on the situation.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.880]   I think it depends on the psychology
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.960]   of the individual that's going through it.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.540]   - You said move through that.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:37.800]   Is there some calculation here that a soldier,
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   when they kill another soldier,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.220]   a realization that it's just another human being,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.520]   I mean, is there some heavy burden to that aspect
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.420]   that it's ultimately just human on human?
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.280]   - I think it depends a lot on the scenario.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.620]   I know that when I was in Iraq fighting,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.820]   we talk a lot about the dehumanization of the enemy,
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.900]   and it's something that the governments will do.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.940]   I mean, governments will do that to each other.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.860]   I mean, the Japanese dehumanized the Americans,
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.380]   and the Americans dehumanized the Japanese,
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.620]   and the Americans dehumanized the Nazis,
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.620]   and the Nazis dehumanized the Americans,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.400]   so that to remove as much of that human on human killing
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.120]   aspect that you're talking about,
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.220]   and what I've said is that when we were in Iraq,
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.740]   we didn't have to dehumanize the enemy
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.780]   because the enemy dehumanized themselves
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.860]   through their actions, through their behaviors.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.480]   When we know that they are torturing, and raping,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.780]   and murdering the local populace,
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.540]   they've been dehumanized.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.540]   And so as far as looking at them and thinking,
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.540]   oh, this is a human, another human that's on the level of,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.660]   you know, my uncle or my brother,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.500]   I didn't think of them that way.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   I thought of them as murdering, raping, evil,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:25.700]   subhumans.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.180]   - Yeah, Iraq is different,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.580]   and America's position is different.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.820]   You're right that America's not involved in a war
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.860]   where it's quite like two humans fighting,
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.180]   like teenage boys fighting against each other.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.300]   - And you've got to remember, I mean,
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.600]   we're seeing these Iraqi kids
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   that are living under this sadistic terror.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.900]   The Iraqi women that are being raped and abused
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.440]   by these insurgents.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.460]   And so on the one side, we become,
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.940]   the Iraqi populace is very humanized to us
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.700]   because we're talking to them, we've got interpreters,
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.340]   we understand, we're seeing them day after day,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.540]   the same individuals.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.460]   And so we form a bond with the local populace,
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.820]   and yet we see what the insurgents are doing.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.480]   And so it's, again, not difficult to dehumanize people
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.880]   that behave in that manner.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.420]   - Yeah, I suppose I worry about the dehumanization
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.900]   at a much larger scale when it's not the kind of case
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.220]   that you're talking about.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.220]   Even now, hopefully I'm not fear-mongering,
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.060]   but there's a sense in which there's the drums of war
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.840]   slowly starting to build with China.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.960]   In the best case, it would be a cold war
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.120]   of there's a dehumanization aspect
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.740]   that's happening with China currently,
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.140]   which is they're the other,
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.200]   and they're after stealing all of your data.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.920]   There's a cybersecurity, it starts with cybersecurity,
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.160]   and it worries me because it creates the other
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.240]   out of a very large population
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.600]   that may ultimately lead to conflict,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.080]   in the worst case, hot conflict
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.980]   that would no longer be the situation you are in in Iraq,
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   and more similar to the Soviet Union conflict with Germany,
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:43.360]   that it's kids, and then they're dehumanized
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.840]   to where you're at scale slaughtering them,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.220]   or at least hurting their quality of life
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.460]   in a way that's maybe, suffering has many forms.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.820]   It doesn't have to be through just a hot war.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.660]   It could be through starvation, through camps,
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.920]   all those kinds of things, and I worry about that.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.700]   We kind of tend to think that these wars are behind us,
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.820]   and I'm not always so sure that's the case,
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:16.460]   at least in the way that it ultimately starts with hate,
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.360]   and again, hopefully I'm not being too dramatic,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.020]   but I see that there's a kind of brewing of,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.620]   it starts with dehumanization,
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.180]   then turns to hate of the other.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.180]   You see that with China, you see it a little bit with Russia,
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.260]   and you have an early podcast between,
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.420]   where you break down the tactics
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.300]   of the Chechen War versus Russia, it's fascinating,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.840]   but that's the kind of conflicts I'm referring to,
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.460]   and I don't know.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.200]   There's a, I know you're a bit of a musician.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.940]   I love Diaristraite's song called "Brothers in Arms."
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.100]   I don't know if you know that one,
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.340]   and there's a line in it.
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:06.060]   I think they play it quite often at military funerals,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.440]   which I just recently learned,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.860]   but it's this powerful song that has a line,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.460]   "We're fools to make war on our brothers in arms."
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.600]   Do you think there's some sense in which,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.000]   at the leadership level, but just as human beings,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   we're perhaps foolish in engaging in military conflict
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.680]   as much as we have?
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.880]   Or is fool a very inappropriate word here?
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.540]   - Well, I think that using the term "brothers in arms"
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.120]   means the people that are on my side, right?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.200]   So it doesn't make sense to start wars
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.920]   with people that are on your side.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.280]   So that might just be the way the lyrics are written
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.420]   so that it fit the song or whatever.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.680]   I think broadly what you're asking me is, is war foolish?
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.800]   - And I would say the answer is yes,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.100]   and if you can avoid it, you absolutely should.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:11.340]   But if there is a bear or a wolf
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.520]   that is trying to get into your house,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.800]   is it foolish to shoot that bear or shoot that wolf?
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.240]   I think the answer is pretty obvious.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.800]   So when you're threatened or your family is threatened
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.640]   or your way of life is threatened,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   then you have to do something to try and defend your family,
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.700]   your way of life.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.320]   It should be the last resort.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.480]   Should be the last resort.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.820]   - You had a conversation with Jordan Peterson.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.660]   - Yeah.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.300]   - He asked you a question
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:53.080]   in terms of war being the last resort,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.220]   whether you would like your kids to grow up in peace
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.520]   in a time of no war.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.140]   You said yes, but, and so it happens
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.340]   Jordan didn't let you finish.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.740]   Can you elaborate what follows the but?
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.700]   - Well, you and I have been talking about the fact
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.180]   that struggle brings people together
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.380]   and brings out the best and the worst.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.500]   Brings out the worst in people.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.820]   War brings out the worst in people.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.720]   It also brings out the best in people.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.660]   So would you want your kid to go
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.140]   and enter in a wrestling tournament
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.140]   where you paid all the other kids off and your kid won?
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:42.140]   Or you enter them in a jujitsu tournament
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.980]   where they're a purple belt
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.860]   and you know that everyone that they're gonna fight against
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.700]   is a white belt.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.660]   And so they get the big W, they get the win,
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.420]   but they don't really get tested
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   and they don't really struggle.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.060]   And if you don't struggle, you don't grow.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.740]   So that's the but, right?
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.260]   The absolute best times of my life were in combat
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:16.660]   and the worst times of my life were in combat.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.420]   And so even though I wouldn't want any of my children
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.300]   to suffer through the worst of times,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.460]   at the same time, the but is I would want them
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.180]   to have the opportunity to feel that bond
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.740]   that you're referring to earlier
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.100]   and to see human beings that are willing
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.500]   to sacrifice their lives for their friends.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.620]   - You mentioned the worst.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.540]   What are some of the worst aspects
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.460]   of when you were in Iraq?
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.900]   What are the things that,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:53.500]   the hardest on you?
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.580]   - Having my guys killed.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.340]   - Is there a absurd cruelty to it?
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.340]   Was it due to mistakes or natural consequences of fighting?
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.740]   Is there any difference?
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.340]   Is that at the end is just losing those brothers in arms?
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.260]   - There's a million different ways to get killed in the war
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.820]   and you can go out on an operation
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.100]   and you can do everything wrong and you can survive.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.420]   And you can go out in an operation
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.860]   and do everything perfect and you can get killed.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.140]   - Is there some aspect which makes it worse
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.180]   when there's mistakes made?
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.580]   - Well, yeah, if there's mistakes made,
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.660]   then you're gonna sit there and beat yourself up eternally
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.060]   for mistakes that were made.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:47.660]   - But to you, the things that hurt is just losing,
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.100]   losing people close to you.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.300]   - Yes.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.060]   - Are you yourself afraid of death?
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.980]   - No.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.500]   - Do you think about it?
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.980]   Does it make sense to you that this thing ends?
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.660]   Like do you, the Stoics contemplated death.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.220]   It gives flavor to life.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.140]   It makes you appreciate.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.900]   There's something about finiteness of life
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.900]   that makes it, this Jaco Discipline Go drink,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:23.340]   sour apple that I'm enjoying is delicious.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.380]   It makes it taste better because I'm going to die one day.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.060]   And I think about that a lot.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.180]   Do you think about it?
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:36.460]   - Other than I know that it's gonna end,
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.060]   I mean, but I don't think about it on a daily basis.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.780]   I think about-- - It's just a fact.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.020]   - I think about, I know that I'm lucky to be here.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.940]   I know that many people sacrificed
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.300]   to give me this opportunity to be here.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.220]   So, but I don't dwell on it.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.340]   - What about when you were in combat?
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.180]   Nothing.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:04.060]   There's tactics, there's strategy, there's the mission.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:09.060]   And then your mortality is not part of the calculation.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.860]   - I think you get to a point where you accept the fact
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.480]   that you can die.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.740]   Like I said, you can do everything right.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.260]   You roll out the gate, you hit an IED,
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.340]   a triple stack subsurface IED, and you're done.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.140]   And there's nothing that's gonna stop that.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.260]   It's gonna happen.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.820]   And I think if you're scared of that
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.060]   or you're thinking about that,
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.660]   it's gonna inhibit your ability to do your job properly.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.460]   And I think it's also gonna drive you crazy.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.220]   The thing that I thought about more
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.720]   was that happening to my guys.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.460]   And that's the gut-wrenching terror that you feel
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.260]   when operations happen.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.020]   - Can I ask you about love of country?
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.740]   It continues to...
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.400]   Just how much I've studied Stalin recently
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.220]   in the past few years, it continues to surprise me.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.200]   Not surprise me, it's just tragic in some kind of way.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.520]   I'm not sure exactly if I could put words to it,
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.560]   but how many people, and still do,
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   but at the time were willing, loved Stalin,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.400]   and were willing to die for country,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.220]   for the love of country.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.460]   And I, too, maybe because I was born there
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.800]   and now I am a red-blooded American,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:35.360]   I love, nationalism is a bad word,
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.640]   but I love the love of country.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:42.640]   It somehow gives meaning, like a brotherhood,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.320]   like we're in this together.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.820]   I love, that's why I love the Olympics.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.880]   That's just the unity of it.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.640]   It takes a step out of the selfish pursuits
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.160]   of any one particular ant,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.700]   and looks at us as a big ant colony.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.760]   And it's inspiring, it's exciting,
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.660]   but at the same time, it seems to get us
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.600]   to do horrible things
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.860]   if manipulated by charismatic leaders.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.980]   What do you make of this love of country?
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.700]   Is it a bad thing?
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.460]   Is it a thing that gets in the way?
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.220]   Or is it a good thing?
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.780]   - Well, I think like anything else,
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.700]   if it's balanced correctly, it's great.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.060]   And if it goes to some extreme level,
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.620]   then it becomes a negative.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.460]   And I think it's probably sourced
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.820]   in some sort of animalistic tribalism
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.980]   that we all have to be part of a tribe.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:49.340]   And this is a real big tribe that you get to be a part of.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.260]   And all you have to do is kind of show up.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.500]   And so when someone says,
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.880]   "Hey, we're gonna play hockey against the Russians."
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:01.080]   Well, we're gonna cheer for the American boys.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.720]   - So my area of work is artificial intelligence.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.240]   It'd be interesting to ask your thoughts about something,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.440]   which is autonomous weapon systems.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.360]   US has now officially released a report
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.540]   saying that they're open to, not open,
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.980]   they're engaging in adding more and more autonomy
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.340]   in artificial intelligence into its weapon systems
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.060]   because China is doing it.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.100]   And so these are the first steps
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.860]   in something that AI folks worry about,
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   which is a race, an AI race
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.280]   in the space of autonomous weapons
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.240]   that can run away too quickly.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.360]   Is that something, I don't know if in general,
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.880]   if you have thoughts about weapon systems
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.360]   that make autonomous decisions
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.000]   at the small scale of just targeting where to shoot
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.120]   and at the larger scale of military strategy
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.880]   of just being given a mission
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.020]   of destroy this particular target,
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.880]   this particular, say, terrorist human being,
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.600]   and then figure out what is the right bombing campaign
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.300]   on your own to accomplish this task
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.060]   that minimizes civilian death.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.820]   And then just loading that in
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.420]   and letting the AI system automatically decide that.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.260]   What are your general thoughts about it?
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.380]   Do you worry about it?
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.620]   Because as the positive effects
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.020]   that in the best version of that world,
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.100]   you kill fewer civilians,
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:42.100]   you kill, hurt fewer of your own human beings.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.740]   But at the negative side of that,
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:50.340]   you might lose the thing we kind of talked about,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.680]   which is the basic humanity,
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.100]   even in the individual soldier
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.180]   of what is right and what is wrong,
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.780]   and not making huge mistakes
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.620]   that hurt thousands or millions of people.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.380]   - I guess what you're asking me
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.540]   is if they could make a machine
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   that could do more surgical attacks on enemy individuals,
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.420]   would I be for it?
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.580]   Yes, I would be for it.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:21.560]   - The problem is, if you've ever used machines of any kind,
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.260]   their initial design may not be,
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.620]   there's unintended consequences.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   There's ways in the machine actually behaves
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.580]   that you realize there's bugs in this thing.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.740]   - So do we not put protocols in place
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.340]   to prevent something from going too far outside
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.780]   the boundaries of what we want it to execute?
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.100]   - You do, but the question is,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.780]   this is the first time in human history
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:55.780]   you can create things, machines, toaster, microwave oven,
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.580]   that's smarter than you in this particular task.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.540]   I mean, it's not yet there.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.580]   What you're learning a lot with military strategy
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.860]   is humans are actually really damn smart.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.740]   It's very hard to improve on a human.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.540]   And so most actual drones that are unmanned
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.260]   are still piloted by humans.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.880]   It's very difficult to do every aspect of war,
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.780]   but it's not out of the realm of possibility
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.980]   that machines will start doing those things better,
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.780]   and certain things,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.480]   certain more precise targeting of the enemy.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.740]   The question is, so what happens
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.940]   when you start to rely on the machine
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.940]   to do some of the task is you get lazy.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.300]   You forget what it is like to do that task,
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.020]   or more importantly, you lose the knowledge
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.360]   of the intricacies of that task,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.560]   and you forget the ways it can go wrong.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.560]   So the protocols may not be sufficient
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.280]   to constrain the power of the ways that things go wrong,
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.060]   especially when things are moving really quickly,
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.140]   especially when the ethics of the two sides
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.020]   aren't perfectly aligned,
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.500]   when people are, some certain sides,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.280]   like on the Chinese side, may be more willing to take risks
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.940]   for dangerous consequences than others.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.040]   So what happened on the bioweapon side is internationally,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.320]   maybe you can speak to this more,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.220]   but my sense, what I was told,
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.080]   there is a sense globally
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.380]   that bioweapons are not going to be used.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.980]   They're unethical.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.140]   There's a sense like we're not going to engage in this,
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.700]   and with AI currently, China and US said,
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.660]   green light, I'll go ahead.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.180]   It's totally ethical.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   If it can decrease the loss of human life, why not?
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:05.820]   My worry is that it's much easier
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.180]   to design weapons that are effective
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:16.740]   than design weapons who have the depth of ethics
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.260]   and morals that humans do,
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.500]   which I think we don't, as human beings,
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.260]   don't acknowledge enough
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.640]   that even the cold calculated killing of others,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.740]   precise, effective execution of a mission
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.980]   still has ethics in it at every level.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.700]   You know what's right and what's wrong.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   And I don't know if you take that away,
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.560]   you're not going to make huge mistakes that you regret.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.820]   Is that something you don't worry about?
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.740]   - I don't really worry about it,
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.620]   but as you design something, like I said,
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.360]   you put protocols in place,
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.220]   and from what I am hearing you say
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.520]   or trying to hear you say,
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.420]   there's be a point where our protocols
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.820]   wouldn't be sufficient to stop the machine
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.280]   from doing something that was unethical.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:17.740]   - I'm kind of worried that this is something
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.500]   you don't worry about,
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.540]   because a lot of people I respect don't worry about it.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.860]   And I don't know what to do about that.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.100]   A lot of generals don't worry about it.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.060]   A lot of people who know much more about war,
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.320]   like you, than me, don't worry about it.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.400]   And that worries me.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.340]   - Well, that's because you have a vision
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.740]   into the shortfalls of AI, and I don't.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.300]   I don't have a vision of the shortfalls of AI.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.820]   I don't know enough about it.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.340]   As far as I'm concerned,
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.660]   you put a on/off switch somewhere,
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:54.140]   you put a kill switch on a system,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.580]   and if it starts going awry,
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.740]   you hit the kill switch and that's it.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.060]   So if, you know, when you look at me and say,
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.500]   well, there's no possible way to put a kill switch
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.800]   that would be 100% effective,
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.700]   and here's, you draw out those concerns to me,
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.220]   and we could talk through it and say,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.140]   okay, well, here's where we should draw the line.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.580]   - Yeah.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.780]   I mean, it's like, again,
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.160]   for the Soviet Union, Chernobyl meltdown,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.440]   there was always the ability, I believe,
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.560]   to have a kill switch.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.160]   The problem is the more power you give to the machine,
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.120]   the more opportunity you give
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.800]   to the human supervising that machine to make a mistake
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.440]   and not shut off the switch at the right time.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.560]   So yes, the solution, I mean,
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.760]   you're putting the responsibility still in the human hands,
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.780]   and I think that's the correct place to put it.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.400]   There should be good protocols, good leadership,
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.200]   good execution, competency all around.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.280]   Your protocols should consider the basic failures
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.160]   of human nature, the human factor of how things go wrong,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.440]   so there should be multiple people
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.740]   supervising the system, all those things.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.980]   But I am just very skeptical
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.920]   of greater and greater power in the machine
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   that can create war, that cannot lead to death.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.560]   - Yeah, and that's why, like I said,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.820]   and like you just said, you have protocols in place
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.380]   that are a kill switch.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.160]   And if you think about the amount of nuclear weapons
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.160]   that we've had on planet Earth
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.020]   for the past however many years,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:28.980]   and there's been no rogue element that said,
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.720]   "You know what, I'm going to shoot this thing."
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.020]   There's been no protocol that took place
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.780]   where all of a sudden we said, "Oh no."
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.560]   I mean, there's been escalations,
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.580]   but the protocols worked, have worked so far.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.800]   Now, that's a scary thing to think about,
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.300]   that we rely on these protocols
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.860]   to stop some rogue element out there
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.300]   from launching a missile that could kill millions of people
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.900]   and trigger a global war.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.000]   So yeah, the protocols should be strict.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.380]   - Okay, can I ask a Jocko Wanko ridiculous question?
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.300]   If human civilization goes extinct,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.780]   what would be the reason?
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.100]   You mentioned nuclear war.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.500]   Do you worry about this?
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.620]   The reason I bring that up,
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.880]   a lot of people in the AI community
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.980]   worry about artificial general intelligence,
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.560]   so super intelligent AI systems creating a lot of damage.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.960]   Autonomous weapon systems is one possibility.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.380]   A lot of folks recently, especially with this pandemic,
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.480]   if you want to be terrified,
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.860]   listen, somebody I talked to recently, Sam Harris,
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.860]   did a four-hour podcast on how bioengineering of viruses
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.460]   is likely to destroy human civilization.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.540]   I recommend that highly if you were too optimistic
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.820]   about the future of the human species.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:54.060]   So apparently, in the space of bioengineering,
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.020]   it's becoming easier and easier and easier
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.580]   to engineer viruses, engineer pathogens.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.100]   (sighs)
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.580]   (laughs)
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.820]   This is the world's most depressing question.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.220]   Is there something in particular you worry about,
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.340]   like that we should be thinking as a human species about?
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.280]   - Yeah, I'm sorry to disappoint you again
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.700]   with my lack of worry for all these problems,
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.280]   but I don't worry too much about it.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.340]   (laughs)
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.300]   You know what, we've made it through a bunch of wickets
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.240]   so far as a species, and we'll make it through some more,
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.780]   or we won't.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.620]   And if we don't make it through some of these wickets
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.460]   and someone decides that what they're gonna do
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.860]   over the weekend is create some crazy virus
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.340]   that spreads and kills everybody, yeah.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.180]   - You know what, I'm usually extremely optimistic
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.000]   about this stuff.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.960]   I am now, I'm with you, except that we won't.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.580]   Well, there's always a chance we won't,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.500]   but I have a sense that human, first of all,
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.240]   I believe that most people have much more capacity
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.080]   for good than evil.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.040]   All of us are capable of evil, I believe,
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.840]   but most people are much more capable of doing good
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.920]   and want to do good.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:19.760]   And I also believe in the resiliency of the human species,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.440]   we're an innovative bunch, and we can respond to tragedy.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.600]   Especially we respond more to tragedy
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.720]   as the scale of the tragedy grows,
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.360]   and our response is much better.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.220]   - So that's why I'm not worried about it, bro.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.620]   (laughing)
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.320]   - What makes a great man?
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.760]   Let's start at the individual.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.040]   What makes a great man?
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.320]   What makes a great woman?
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.880]   What makes a great human being?
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.240]   - Somebody that puts others above themselves.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.360]   - What makes a great leader of humans?
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.400]   - Same thing.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.520]   - But that sentence does a lot of work.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.120]   There's, when you're a leader, there's a lot of egos,
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.760]   there's a lot of tension, there's the humans,
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.300]   the human factor.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.300]   There's people who are timid, there's people who are
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.220]   assholes, there's people who are incredibly competent,
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.820]   but self-obsessed, I don't know.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.820]   There's complexities of human nature.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.540]   How do you get all those people
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.880]   to be the best version of themselves
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.900]   and to lift up everyone else around them?
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.220]   - Okay, so now that question is a little bit different now.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.440]   So now it's getting into a more specific question,
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.960]   but at the same time, a more broad question of
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.520]   what elements does it take to make a good leader?
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.240]   So you're right, that different people have
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.680]   different personalities, different tendencies,
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.320]   different levels of ego.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.820]   And the way that I try and explain this is
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.920]   like a video game, and I'm not even a video game player,
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.800]   but I've seen this before, where video game characters
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.520]   have various skills, various strengths and weaknesses.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.620]   So maybe they're strong, but they're dumb,
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.560]   or maybe they're strong and smart, but they're slow.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.200]   They just give them these ratings.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.020]   And so that's what human beings are.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.440]   And that's the way leaders are.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.460]   And you can have different leaders
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.080]   with different characteristics.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:21.000]   And depending on how all those characteristics match up,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.780]   you can have somebody that is very introverted,
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.280]   but they're still a very good leader,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.700]   because when they do communicate,
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.460]   they do it in a clear, simple manner
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:33.480]   that everyone understands.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.940]   So even though they're a little bit introverted,
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.440]   people still respect them and listen to them
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.880]   because they communicate in a clear way.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.600]   You could have somebody that's extremely charismatic,
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.240]   extremely charismatic, and everyone looks to them,
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.360]   but they're slow in making decisions.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.480]   And so now we've got someone that can't really
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.540]   make decisions when decisions need to get made.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.980]   So even though they're charismatic,
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.760]   they're still not a good leader.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.720]   So depending on the human being that we're talking about,
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.000]   and you just mentioned earlier that human beings
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.100]   are more complex than anything and do a better job
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.080]   at just about everything than a robot.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.400]   So that's the same thing with leadership.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.760]   You've got all these different characteristics
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.840]   and you match them or mix them together.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.240]   And depending on where the ratings come out,
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.720]   depending on how that thing does in the end.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.480]   - Can we almost like as a case study,
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.160]   look at a few people in the tech area
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.880]   that I'm familiar with and I know well?
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.280]   - We can, the only caveat being that I may have
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   no familiarization with them whatsoever.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.360]   You may have to brief me on them.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.720]   - Yeah, so I'll do my best to brief,
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.340]   I'll do my best to reduce human beings
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.280]   into simple descriptions.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.680]   And then you can give me insights
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.640]   of why the hell there are such effective leaders
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.720]   based on my description,
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.720]   not based on your actual deep knowledge of the human beings.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.280]   - So that caveat of my inability to speak
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.240]   both the English language and describe humans well.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.160]   Let's talk about first Elon Musk.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.880]   So he's known as being quite harsh
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.240]   in the sense of first of all, a very high bar of excellence
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.680]   and also willing to what he calls
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.600]   the kind of first principles thinking
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   of asking the questions that hurt,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.380]   which is why the hell are we doing it this way?
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.040]   Why can't it be done a lot better,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.880]   not just better, but a lot better?
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.080]   - So let's, I don't wanna hear his whole character.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.780]   I'll go one section at a time.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.180]   So we got a guy that's harsh
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.720]   and asking the really hard questions.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.000]   How can that be good or why is that good?
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.080]   Well, first of all, it can be horrible.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.800]   And there's leaders out there that are harsh
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.240]   and they're hated and no one likes them
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.200]   and no one wants to work for them
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.880]   and they never do anything.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.440]   So what is it that Elon Musk does
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.280]   that makes, gives him the ability to be harsh?
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   So I was hearing a description of me
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.200]   when I would give feedback to young SEALs
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.360]   that had made mistakes during training operations.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.080]   And the description was that same thing,
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.480]   like this harsh blunt force trauma
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   and just totally direct sledgehammer of truth
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.960]   that I would hit guys with.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.120]   But it's interesting because I always talk about,
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.360]   you know, building relationships
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.560]   and making sure you're not offending someone.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.280]   So how do these things match up?
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.260]   Well, I can tell you how they match up.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.320]   When I was being harsh,
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.360]   the guys that I was being harsh with
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.880]   knew without one shred of doubt
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.100]   that I cared about them more than anything else.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.080]   And that the reason I was giving them this feedback
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.600]   is because I wanted them to be able to lead their troops.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.760]   I wanted them to be able to go accomplish their mission.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.400]   And I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.280]   from war.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.440]   So I wasn't being harsh because it elevated my ego.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.160]   I wasn't being harsh 'cause I wanted to denigrate them.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.960]   I was being, actually being harsh
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.360]   because I wanted them to accomplish the mission.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   So if that's where Elon comes from,
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.340]   hey, listen, we got to make this happen.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.920]   This is for the good of the world to do this.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.520]   And people know that, then it works.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.040]   - I'll bring this point back up
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.600]   with another guy, Steve Jowes.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.400]   But let me stay on Elon for a second.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:35.520]   The other thing he does, which is interesting,
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.000]   I see the value of this.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.040]   It'd be great to hear you speak about it.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.160]   It's unlike many of the other CEOs,
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.360]   very rich billionaires, you know,
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.980]   involved in leading a lot of people.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:52.980]   He puts a lot of time into making sure
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.220]   he's on the factory floor.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.380]   He famously sleeps on the,
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.580]   sort of like in the middle of things.
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.820]   And he puts a lot of effort.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.540]   He's also very good at it, is being a low-level engineer.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.140]   So like whatever the task is,
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.020]   he wants to understand the details.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.020]   And he'll talk to the lowest level person
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.000]   in terms of like, you know, somebody who's like,
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:19.220]   working literally on putting parts together.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.820]   He wants to understand what the problem is,
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.100]   what the challenge is.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.860]   If there's an emergency,
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.460]   he wants to understand the actual details of the problem.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.820]   Not like delegating it to a manager,
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.940]   but like, 'cause a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:35.140]   will talk about sort of the power
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.060]   and the importance of delegation.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.340]   Here, he wants to know if there's a big problem,
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.220]   he wants to know the exact detail.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.180]   He wants to know the exact problem.
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.240]   He wants to, at the fundamental level,
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.360]   understand how to solve that problem.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.840]   Whether it has to do with materials,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.200]   whether it has to do with the actual manufacturing,
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.680]   the mechanical engineering aspect.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   Like we're talking about like engineering.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.960]   This is a guy who wears a suit, is a CEO,
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.560]   tweets about Dogecoin, but like actual job,
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.800]   he's low-level engineering.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.860]   And that, to me, was always inspiring
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.800]   to see somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.200]   That's what it, like he gains the respect
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.360]   of engineers at the lowest level.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.160]   I don't know if that's scalable,
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.800]   but that's always been inspiring to me.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.960]   And I wonder how many people it's inspiring to.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.000]   Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.960]   of no matter how high your level of leader is,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.320]   to be able to do the low-level shit.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.320]   - Yeah, and that's a common trait that good leaders have.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.280]   And maybe he doesn't necessarily know how to do everything,
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.560]   a good leader, but they go down there
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.440]   and talk to the frontline troops and say,
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.480]   "Hey, what is the issue that you're dealing with?"
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.920]   Or, "How can I support you?
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.080]   "How can I give you help?"
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.040]   And one key point that you said is he said,
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.960]   "When there's a problem, he gets in there."
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.400]   So there's things happening at his companies
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.960]   that they're working.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.080]   And so he doesn't have to die.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.220]   I'm not saying he never does,
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.680]   but he doesn't have to spend as much time working on
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.800]   or looking at some subsystem that's functioning well.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.780]   He's got a good leader in there that's handling it,
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:14.940]   and he checks in with that leader,
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.520]   and the leader says, "Yeah, it's working perfectly."
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.200]   He says, "Great."
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.320]   That when there's a problem,
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.960]   that's when he might have to get down there
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.480]   and dig into some details so that he fully understands it.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.380]   So that he, when he digs down in the details,
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.500]   and this is important,
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.880]   he's coming from an altitude where he has
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.520]   better, bigger perspective,
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.440]   not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:40.000]   So if you sit there and work on a problem, whatever,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.480]   for eight hours, and you're staring at,
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.000]   if you were planning a mission,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.740]   and you were planning it for eight hours,
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.960]   you're staring at the maps and the charts,
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.120]   and you're figuring out where all the troops
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.640]   are going to be located,
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.240]   and I come in after eight hours,
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.620]   and I look at your plan from a distant perspective,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.340]   there's a good chance I'll be able to see holes in your plan
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.200]   that you couldn't see because your perspective was too close.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.640]   So that's good for me to be able to come in
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.880]   from a higher perspective and have a look at it.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.320]   But also there's times where I need to get down there
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.000]   and actually look.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.440]   You know, if you're looking at a problem and you say,
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.560]   "Look, I can't figure out, boss,
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.040]   I can't figure out how to get to this target.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.760]   And I'm looking at it from a distance and I don't see,
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   I might need to start digging in and looking and saying,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.760]   oh, here's a route that we can take
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.000]   that actually makes sense, let's try that."
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.600]   So I think it's a good example of someone
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.560]   going up and down in altitude to look at problems,
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.360]   understanding what's happening with the frontline troops,
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.000]   and at the same time, being able to go back
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.960]   to the strategic level.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.840]   And I can, it's probably this way.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.000]   The reason that he's successful
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.600]   is because he doesn't get stuck down there.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.960]   Because if he felt the need to micromanage
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.160]   each and every part on a Tesla,
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:57.720]   it wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.680]   that he would have the capacity to do all that.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.920]   Now, he can hand over some broad chip design and say,
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.360]   "Hey, this is what the function needs to be."
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.240]   And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.080]   and you figure it out and you make it happen.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.360]   If he had to actually do that all himself,
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.400]   most likely not possible.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   So that's what leaders should be doing.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.320]   They should go elevate and then get down in the weeds
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.000]   when they have to, and then go back up.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.960]   - The sad thing, this is the part
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.800]   that makes me not wanna do a startup,
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:33.440]   is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.960]   Just like you said, he's not dealing,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.720]   this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.320]   It's dealing with like, in the case of a company,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.800]   life and death, like something that can just
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.440]   completely damage the production line, right?
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.080]   So he's constantly dealing with emergencies,
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.720]   putting out fires.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.080]   And I don't know if there's something to be said
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.380]   about that psychology of how,
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.560]   like he's spoken himself that he's worried
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.660]   whether his mind can hold up much longer.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.640]   - So hopefully in the near future,
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.200]   he will start to form more decentralized command
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.120]   where he has some subordinate leadership
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.680]   that he fully trusts.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.560]   And most important that he is properly trained
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.940]   so that they can handle these day-to-day fires,
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.840]   at least 80% of them.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.800]   So only 20% of the time does he actually need to go in
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.280]   and solve a problem.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.500]   If he's not doing that right now,
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.040]   then that's going to end up being a problem.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.960]   Anytime, so I work with companies all the time,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.880]   and that's what's interesting about this is,
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.760]   I go and work with a CEO or with a C-suite of a company,
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.120]   it takes a little while to figure out what's going on.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.720]   I'm kind of going off of the things that you're telling me
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.440]   almost anecdotally, right?
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   But let's say that what you get,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.600]   and also I don't know how familiar you actually are
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.760]   with the inner workings of his companies,
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:58.480]   but if we were to assume that what you're saying is accurate
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.260]   then my advice would be, hey, listen,
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.360]   you need to start putting a little bit more time and effort
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.400]   into training up some subordinate leadership
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.320]   that has the trust, knowledge, and expertise
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.160]   that you will be able to turn over some of these details to,
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.000]   for two reasons.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Number one, so you can let your brain,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.480]   you can survive a little longer, as he put it,
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.200]   but also all the time that you spend as a leader
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.440]   looking down and into your organization
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.440]   is time that you're not looking up and out.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.720]   So when you're not looking up and out,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.880]   you're not seeing what the competitor's doing,
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.360]   you're not seeing where the market's going,
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.200]   there's problems that can come from that.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.000]   So if right now he's spending too much time
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.280]   looking down and in, and you mentioned,
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.520]   you said, I don't know if I wanna do a startup.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.360]   When you do a startup,
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.240]   you're gonna be looking down and in for a while.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.200]   It's gonna take a while,
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.840]   you're gonna have to do all this work yourself,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.880]   you're not gonna have the finances
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.880]   to put people, manpower behind these things.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.960]   So that's probably, maybe he's in that mindset a little bit
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.000]   'cause he's done so many startups over the years,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.640]   and so he's in the, he's habitually in the weeds.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.360]   So my advice would be, all right,
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.120]   let's start looking at formulating
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.680]   some subordinate leadership that has the, like I said,
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.640]   the expertise, the trust that you can start to turn over
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.880]   some of these more minute details to them
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.680]   so that you can start looking up and out.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.200]   - Yeah, I think he's done that more successfully
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.400]   in some places than others.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   At SpaceX, a lot of people give the credit
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.740]   to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the COO of SpaceX
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.560]   as a very successful person that runs shit,
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.360]   but in Tesla, not as much.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.960]   So I wonder if you can comment on something
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.200]   a lot of people worry about,
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.440]   and this applies to a lot of tech companies,
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.800]   which is a lot of people worry about
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   that if Elon disappears, the innovative spirit,
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.560]   the company as we know 'em today will collapse,
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.840]   will stagnate, and will basically fail to do
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.600]   what they've been doing for so many years successfully.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.880]   Is there some aspect to what makes a good leader
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.760]   that if you disappear, it's still,
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.680]   the thing still lives on, and not just lives on, but thrives?
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.740]   - Yeah, so what we have to do in those situations
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.120]   is we have to establish a strong culture
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.200]   inside that organization.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   And if you're, there's reasons why this happens, right?
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.040]   If I have a big ego, and I form a company,
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.120]   and I love the fact that everyone looks at me and says,
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.560]   "Oh, Jocko made this company,
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.800]   "and he's the creative force behind this company,"
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.160]   and that fuels my ego, and it makes me feel good,
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.400]   and I'm working with you, Lex,
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.120]   and every time you come up with an idea,
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.520]   I say, "Lex, you need to stay in your box."
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.400]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.080]   So I'm not creating a culture
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.720]   that rewards that sort of creativity.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.320]   And eventually, when I die,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.080]   I won't have educated my team
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.680]   on how to maintain that creative aspect.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.000]   So again, hopefully, inside that organization,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.040]   he's encouraging and growing that culture
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.840]   where creativity is rewarded,
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.720]   where it flourishes, even when he's gone.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.560]   That's what we have to hope for.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.600]   - He is, but I also seem to notice
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.400]   that there's not many people like him.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.400]   People become complacent too easily.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.040]   I've been disappointed by people a little bit.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.520]   It's like success makes people soft.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.680]   With Elon, it seems like success doesn't have any effect.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.640]   It's like the reverse effect.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.080]   It's always like, what's the next biggest thing, right?
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.320]   He's living that exponential growth,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.920]   which I think that's the problem
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.200]   that you have to have somebody
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.400]   who's constantly trying to find the 10X solution,
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.720]   like trying to constantly improve things and restlessly.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.240]   That probably has to do with finding the right people,
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.560]   not just creating the culture,
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.200]   but creating a culture with the right set of people.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.820]   Speaking of which, Steve Jobs.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:19.720]   There's two things I wanna mention there.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.000]   Once again, the harshness, but a very different kind.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.540]   And the second is team building.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:29.540]   So on the harshness, he is much harsher than Elon
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:34.920]   in the following way.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.200]   Having a sense that you will not like this,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.320]   but I'd like to defend it,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320]   is he loses his shit quite a bit.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.440]   He was famously, at least especially early on,
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.480]   being very emotional.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.520]   He was letting passion dominate the discussion.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.840]   There'd be a lot of firings.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.400]   There would be a lot of mean things said to people.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.800]   I don't know what you make of that.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.280]   How much as a leader are you allowed to just lose your shit
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.280]   in your love for the thing you're doing?
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.660]   And how effective is that?
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.860]   - As a leader, you shouldn't be doing that very often.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.600]   So you can look back at me and say,
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.400]   well, Jocko, here's the most profitable company
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.360]   that's ever existed, and so you're wrong.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.520]   Well, going back to that multitude of characteristics
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.320]   that human beings can have,
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.540]   well, it's the same thing with businesses.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.280]   It's the same thing with companies.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:37.480]   Steve Jobs was off the charts in some of his traits,
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.280]   his ability to understand design,
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.300]   his ability to understand human interface
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.760]   with computer systems.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   So far off the charts that despite his bad temper,
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:58.800]   emotional behavior, the company still thrived.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.660]   That can happen.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.880]   You can have people that are horrible leaders
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.880]   that develop something that's so universally outstanding
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.720]   that you end up with a company that's successful.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.400]   I get asked that a bunch.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.760]   People always ask me, 'cause I say,
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.440]   look, you shouldn't be losing your temper as a leader.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.520]   Well, what about Steve Jobs?
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.080]   He used to yell and scream all the time.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.200]   Great.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.440]   When people say that to me, I say,
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:34.320]   oh, okay, are you as good at design as Steve Jobs was?
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:39.220]   Are you as good at marketing as Steve Jobs was?
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.680]   He had a certain amount of skills that were off the charts,
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.600]   and so he was able to be successful
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.560]   despite the fact that he would lose his temper,
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.760]   treat people horribly.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.580]   That's not good.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.780]   It's not good.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.480]   And it would have been even more successful
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.280]   if he wouldn't had those characteristics.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.520]   Now you might say, well,
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:04.560]   his anger is what pushed things.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.380]   Well, let me ask you this.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.800]   What leader wins?
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.200]   The leader whose team is afraid?
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.120]   The team who executes the mission
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.980]   because they're afraid of their leader,
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.640]   or executes the task because they're afraid of their leader,
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.600]   or the team that loves their leader so much
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.680]   that they don't wanna let them down?
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.140]   Which team wins?
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.080]   - You're implying a confidence
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   that love is more powerful than fear, but I'm not so sure.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.720]   This is the Machiavelli question.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.600]   You're saying ultimately it's always better to lead
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.260]   by inspiration and love
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.260]   than by putting the fear into the team.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.440]   - What I'm saying is that I've seen countless times
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.520]   is me leading through my authority,
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.980]   leading through my rank,
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:58.560]   leading through punitive measures
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.220]   is infinitely worse than me and you
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.320]   working together as a team to win.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:08.380]   - On the second point of Steve Jobs
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.620]   is he has this idea of philosophy of A players
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.200]   where you have a group,
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.460]   like the power and the productivity
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:23.380]   of a group of what he called A players
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:27.500]   is invaluable.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.420]   So you wanna get a team of people
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.160]   who are the best at what they do,
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.500]   but the most important aspect to him
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.140]   was that a single quote unquote B player
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:41.300]   on the team destroys the entire productivity of the team.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.220]   Is there something that brings true to that?
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.100]   So he was, this could be a temper thing,
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.180]   but vicious about firing and removing
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.180]   what he felt was a toxic B player in a team.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.120]   So A players feed off of each other
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.860]   unless there's one B player present.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   - Depends on the nature of the B player.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.940]   Is the player a B player because he's a little bit lazy?
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:14.220]   Is he a B player because he doesn't have good vision?
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.180]   Is he a B player because he's got a big ego
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.620]   and always thinks he's right
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.540]   and now creates conflict in the team?
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.180]   So there's a bunch of different B players.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.820]   Look, if you're working for me
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.460]   and you're kind of a B player, but guess what?
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.340]   You're a grinder and you get stuff done.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.540]   I want you on the team.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.220]   You might not be the smartest person I have,
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.620]   but I know that you're committed to the team
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.580]   and I want you on the team.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.620]   So you're a B player, but that's okay.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:47.220]   Now, if you're Lex with a giant ego,
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.820]   I'd rather have Lex that's not quite as smart
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.300]   'cause I got other people that are smart.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.460]   I got other people that are smart on the team.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.140]   Look, you're gonna need some smart people on the team,
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.140]   but a team is made up, it's a team.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.860]   And so you take these different components of a team
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.160]   and if you have complimentary components,
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.060]   you'll end up with a superior team
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.300]   than just basing it on the level of,
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.980]   and what's an A player?
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.380]   Sometimes in the SEAL teams,
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:18.860]   they would get something called the stacked platoon.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.820]   And what that would be is someone,
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.420]   some senior person in that platoon
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.560]   would manipulate and maneuver
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.200]   to get the quote best guys that he could in that platoon.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.140]   So, the most experienced guys,
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.900]   the person that had great, great reputations.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.260]   And sometimes those platoons would be great.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.940]   Sometimes they would implode
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.440]   because what you end up with is a bunch of A players
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.300]   and now no one wants to follow anyone else.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.660]   No one wants to agree with anyone else.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.540]   Everyone wants to do it my way, not it's my way,
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.380]   not Lex's way.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.980]   Lex is stupid, no, you're stupid.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.760]   We end up with problems.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.620]   So can one person derail a team?
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.500]   Absolutely.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.700]   Under good leadership, one person should not derail a team.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:08.520]   - This could be a tech thing too.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.280]   There's some multiplying effect of just pure excellence,
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.120]   no matter the personalities.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.920]   I think for Steve Jobs,
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.480]   the ego doesn't matter.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.400]   None of that matters.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.020]   What matters is the quality of the output,
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.780]   the genius of the result.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.560]   And that somehow multiplies itself.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.240]   And the ego's actually,
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.560]   like one of the problems with egos
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.000]   is like what does ego usually say?
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.840]   It says I'm much better than you.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.320]   When you have people that are really good together,
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.280]   it's very hard for the ego to flourish
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.360]   'cause you're like constantly being shown
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.520]   that you're not as good.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.320]   And there's a competition.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.360]   So like, I think his idea was that like,
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.200]   if you get people that are really good at what they do,
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.620]   it turns as opposed to you being complacent
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.300]   and not doing much
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   and thinking you're better than everyone else
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.460]   and your opinion is better,
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:05.340]   is you almost getting in that competitive race.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.700]   You know that magic that happens
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.020]   when you're at the end of a marathon
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.800]   and you're just like head to head,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.420]   like you're just going full steam
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.020]   with a person that is as good as you.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.780]   There's no place for ego there.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.220]   - Which is great.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.560]   Which is great.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.060]   Let's use that example.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.100]   You and I are racing.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.860]   We're at the end of the marathon.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.440]   We're both highly competitive, highly competitive.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.960]   We have massive egos and we both want to win.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.020]   We both want to win so bad
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.700]   that we give everything we've got.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.120]   That's totally positive, right?
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.960]   - Yeah.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.800]   - Isn't that totally positive?
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.440]   Now imagine this, same thing.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.920]   We're in a race, we're in a marathon,
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.360]   we're in the last hundred meters,
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.240]   it's you against me and our egos are huge
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.360]   and we're pushing to win.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.040]   And you start to pull ahead of me.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.800]   And my ego is so big and I hate losing so much
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.060]   that I somehow accidentally push my knee up
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.640]   against your foot on a back stride
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.920]   and throw you onto your face.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.340]   So that's what, ego is an awesome driver
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.760]   unless you let your ego control you.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.400]   And you let ego drive your decision making process
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.780]   in which case it turns into an incredible problem.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.760]   So you might have someone that is excellent.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.820]   You might have someone that's outstanding.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.180]   You might have someone that's 10s across the board
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.980]   but their ego is so big that they can't work
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.260]   with other people.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.940]   They can't accept anyone else's ideas.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.260]   They can't compromise on something
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.500]   'cause they think their idea is better all the time.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.420]   And that is going to be problematic.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.500]   And I don't want them on the team.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.180]   Now, as a good leader, guess what I'll do?
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.340]   I'll put them into a situation
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:51.320]   where I can utilize their best aspects
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.200]   but not have their ego destroy the team.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.220]   So I might say, "Hey Lex, you know what?
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.720]   "I actually want you to take lead
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.520]   "on this part of the project over here.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.540]   "And since you're so smart and you work so hard,
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.040]   "I know you're going to pull ahead of everyone else.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.520]   "So you grind on that.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.740]   "Once you get that result, give it to me
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.940]   "and I'm going to disseminate it to the team."
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.220]   So I isolate you from wrecking yourself
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.440]   and the rest of the team with your giant ego.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.700]   - So then looking at a completely opposite person
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.460]   who's just a fascinating person to me,
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.420]   is Sandra Pachai, who's the CEO of Alphabet,
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.420]   CEO of Google.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:37.140]   I admire the, in a romantic sense,
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:41.700]   the madness that is Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.580]   So to me, the opposite of that, Sandra Pachai,
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:50.180]   who's like, everybody loves him.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:54.500]   And he's also a great listener.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.380]   So he always brings people together.
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:01.380]   And so the energy of that person in a room is like,
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.620]   the basic energy, if I were to summarize it,
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:07.260]   is like, I want to hear all the voices in the room.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.260]   That's the energy he brings.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:13.620]   And it's almost like he doesn't want
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.580]   to impose a final decision.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.580]   He wants to hear all the voices
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.860]   and somehow always the decision just falls out.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:25.700]   I don't know what to say about that style of leadership,
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.020]   but it's always surprising to me how
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:33.220]   that love brought a lot of people together.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.940]   And still, I mean, some of the greatest things
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.900]   Google has done over the past several years
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.780]   could be attributed to that.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.220]   Continued innovation, bringing out the best out of people.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.580]   There's of course bureaucracy, which I could criticize
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.420]   at the end of the day,
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.580]   which always happens with big companies.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.220]   I would argue actually the dictatorial style
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.180]   of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk helped fight the bureaucracy,
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.460]   which is one criticism I would give
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.740]   of being a listener and being kind.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.580]   It's sometimes you can't cut through the bullshit
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.900]   as effectively.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.420]   But he's one of the only people I've ever heard of
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.380]   who everybody loves.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.660]   He's an inspirational figure to millions.
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.140]   Especially in India, he's a celebrity
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.860]   in the best kind of way.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.820]   Is there something you could say
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.300]   about that kind of leadership
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.900]   where you're never the asshole,
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.860]   you're never the dictator, you're always the listener
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:29.860]   and the compassionate, empathetic glue
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.660]   that brings the team together, basically with love.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.440]   - Yeah, that's great leadership.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.200]   - If you had to choose for Google.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.720]   For large companies, is there something to be said
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.800]   about what is more effective?
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.680]   The dictator, ruling by love or ruling by fear?
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.240]   - First of all, everything's a dichotomy, right?
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.000]   And so to think that all the time
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.840]   you're always gonna be able to just bark orders at people
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:04.960]   and they're always gonna listen to you
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.240]   and you're always gonna get the best result,
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.120]   that would not be smart.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.920]   To think that every single time
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.200]   you're gonna come to a 100% consensus amongst the troops
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.400]   and that decision is going to reveal itself
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.080]   without you nudging it along,
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.440]   that would also be short-sighted and naive.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.920]   So what a good leader does is they stay balanced.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.040]   And as much as they can,
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.400]   they listen to what the troops have to say,
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.720]   they take that feedback.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.960]   Maybe they quietly nudge things.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.040]   And I'm sure he does that.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.520]   I'm sure he does some nudging
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.600]   that maybe no one even picks up on.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.320]   I like to say the best forms of leadership
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.880]   is leadership with minimum force required.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.920]   So if I can go into a room as a leader
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.720]   and not say one single thing
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.400]   and the team can come to the right consensus
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.120]   and move in that direction, that's my preferred method.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.040]   Maybe I have to give them a little bit of a nudge,
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.880]   a 10% nudge in one direction.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.080]   Okay, that's better than me walking in there
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.160]   and giving them 100% dictatorial direction
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.580]   of exactly what I want to have happen.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:11.040]   Now, occasionally, if we have an emergency situation,
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.280]   people are starting to be frazzled
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.180]   and they're not sure which direction to go,
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.200]   then sometimes as a leader,
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.040]   you have to walk in and say,
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.000]   "All right, everyone, here's where we're going."
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.400]   And people get on board.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.220]   Why?
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.860]   Because for many years or months or however long,
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:29.160]   you've trusted them to come up with a plan.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.720]   And when you as a leader trust your team
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.880]   to come up with a plan,
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.920]   the team starts to trust you
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.480]   and you get leadership capital.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.200]   And as you build leadership capital,
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.600]   occasionally you need to cash in
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.560]   some of that leadership capital,
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.880]   you need to spend some of it.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.720]   And maybe it is,
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.360]   "Hey, listen, here's the direction we're going right now.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.240]   We'll debrief it later, but we got to make a move."
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.860]   And the team who trusts you says,
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.520]   "Roger that, boss, we got it."
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.620]   - And all of them actually do this interesting thing.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.420]   I'd love to hear your opinion on it.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:03.300]   Sandra certainly does it to a large degree,
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:08.300]   which is, it's in the process of delegation,
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:14.500]   trusting a person to do a really difficult thing.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   Like tossing it up,
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:23.320]   saying like, "I trust you can get this job done."
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.280]   Even if your resume does not support that.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.540]   I'm actually kind of amazed the human beings
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.720]   when they're given the trust to get the job done,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.720]   they step up very often.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.120]   That's kind of an amazing property of human nature.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.440]   - People often ask me issues about leadership
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.840]   and I always say that one of the best tools
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.540]   for teaching leadership
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.460]   and for teaching a bunch of other lessons
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.040]   is leadership itself.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.140]   So when, it happens all the time.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.560]   When you elevate someone into a leadership position,
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.720]   they do step up and they do make things happen.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.200]   So that's not surprising to me.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.300]   You do have to mitigate risks.
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.060]   So saying, "Hey, Lex, I know you're,
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.580]   haven't been in the military before.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:11.460]   I know you have very limited weapons experience,
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.180]   but I want you to run a target assault
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.420]   on a real mission in whatever country."
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.800]   That would not be good.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.980]   That would not be a good move on my part.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.660]   Now, if I said, "All right, Lex, you know what?
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.060]   I want you to get some leadership experience.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.540]   I've got a training mission
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.140]   and it's going to be using paintball
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.020]   and I'm going to put you in charge of it.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.480]   I got no problem doing that."
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:37.100]   - Some of that is judging human character.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.180]   It's like there's potential,
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.880]   there's something in this person
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.000]   that they have enough demons
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.800]   or whatever the hell it requires to have that fuel,
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.240]   they'll figure it out.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.740]   They'll hate themselves if they don't.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.640]   And they'll find the right,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.400]   they'll find the tools, they'll find the path,
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.080]   they'll, to achieve the,
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.960]   whatever the level of perfection they can.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.160]   It's been really surprising to me.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.200]   It's been making me rethink the whole hiring process
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.520]   because I often, now I'm thinking and looking,
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.720]   so I'm looking for people,
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.360]   both for the startup, but just for my own life,
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.280]   to help.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.160]   And I almost want to see evidence of excellence,
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.460]   but maybe you want to just,
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.240]   based on just judgment of human character,
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.320]   without evidence of excellence,
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.540]   have people step up.
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:26.760]   Like Joe Rogan with Jamie,
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.280]   that's a funny side of,
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.360]   I didn't understand how little Joe knew about Jamie
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.760]   when he hired him.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.080]   And Jamie stepped up
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.040]   and now runs one of the most successful podcasts ever.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.840]   And that's an incredible kind of,
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:43.080]   and he's one of the best producers in the world now,
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.520]   not to let it get to his head.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.480]   And by the way, the funny thing about him--
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.480]   - And one of the best Googlers in the world.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.560]   - Best Googlers.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.680]   The funny thing about Jamie,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.760]   this is, okay, you might not like this,
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.640]   but what I like,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.640]   I'm constantly exceptionally self-critical
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.960]   to a point of self-hating sometimes.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   I deeply appreciate every single moment I'm alive,
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.040]   but everything I've ever done, I feel like is shit.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:12.200]   And when I talk to Jamie about everything he's done,
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.320]   he's just in every way he carries himself,
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.560]   he's so self-critical.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.100]   He's so worried that it's wrong, it's bad,
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.360]   that anxious energy, I love it.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.240]   'Cause that's how you lead to growth and progress.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.040]   You might, a therapist might say,
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.800]   that's probably not good for your well-being.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.640]   Fuck it.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:37.720]   What's good for your well-being is to create awesome things.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.920]   That's ultimately what leads to happiness,
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.240]   is to create the best thing you can in your life.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:46.120]   And so when I see that in somebody like Jamie
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   or anybody I talk to, when you're really self-critical,
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.480]   that's a good sign to me.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.320]   Is that ridiculous? (laughs)
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.400]   - It's not ridiculous at all.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.360]   And it goes back,
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.160]   the way you were phrasing these questions
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.160]   about what makes a good person and what makes a good leader,
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.180]   the way you phrased them kind of eliminated
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.020]   the normal answer that I give.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.640]   The normal answer that I give,
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.760]   you ask me what makes a good leader,
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:14.860]   what makes a good person, is being humble.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:20.240]   So when you're going to hire someone for your startup
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.160]   or whatever company you're creating,
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.560]   that is a key characteristic to look for,
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.920]   is someone that has the humility, like young Jamie,
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.000]   to say, "Yeah, I could have done this better,
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.120]   "and here's what I can improve,
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.040]   "and here's what I need to work on."
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.560]   When you have somebody that thinks they know everything,
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.440]   out of the gate, you're already got someone
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.360]   that's going to be hard to deal with.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.260]   They're going to be hard to coach.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.080]   They're going to be hard to mentor.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.640]   When you have somebody that's truly humble,
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.000]   you barely, again, it's minimum force required.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.120]   Because when you say to Jamie after a show,
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.200]   "How do you think that went?"
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.700]   He says, "Well, I did this wrong,
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.160]   "and I didn't have this set up in time."
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.360]   And you don't barely have to do anything,
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.040]   because he's got the humility.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.240]   If you've got someone that's a big ego,
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.920]   and you say, "Hey, how did that show go?"
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.560]   He goes, "It went awesome on my end."
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.640]   Now guess what you have to do?
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.160]   Now you have to start applying force as a leader,
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.740]   which is expending leadership capital,
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.840]   which we don't want to do,
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.960]   because we always try and conserve our leadership capital
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.280]   as much as we possibly can.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.780]   And when we have to expend it just to get Jamie
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:22.200]   to make some improvements, that's bad.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.040]   So when you go looking for people,
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:24.960]   look for people that are humble.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.280]   Now, does this mean you look for people
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.420]   that don't have any confidence?
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.560]   No, that's not what I'm saying.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.840]   There's a balance to all these things.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.680]   That's the dichotomy of leadership.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.140]   But people tend towards, and look,
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.680]   I work with a lot of military troops in the past.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.160]   Now I work with companies.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.000]   The reason I talk about humility all the time
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   is because for someone to get into a leadership position
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.060]   in the military, they have to have confidence.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:52.780]   So the tendency is that their confidence
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:56.380]   is going to outweigh their humility at some point.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.820]   Same thing with civilian companies.
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.340]   If you get to a point of leadership inside of a company,
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.060]   you have to have confidence to get there.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.020]   You don't get to a position of leadership
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.660]   inside of a company lacking confidence.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:11.500]   So the tendency is for confidence
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.020]   to grow a little bit too much.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:17.980]   And we have to put that confidence into check.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.420]   We have to put that ego into check.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.580]   Really good leaders, they're confident, but they're humble.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:24.380]   That's the balance of the dichotomy.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.460]   - Hear that, Jamie?
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.300]   Don't get cocky.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:32.820]   On occasion, rarely you talk about discipline.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.580]   What does a disciplined life look like?
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.380]   - Doing what you're supposed to do.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.420]   - What if I want to lay on the couch
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.460]   and eat Cheetos and watch soap operas?
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:49.260]   That's not, that doesn't feel like discipline.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.300]   Do you think you're supposed to do that?
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:58.060]   - Well, you could argue from a sort of
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.300]   meaning of life perspective that perhaps
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.820]   happiness is the most important,
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.260]   and if it makes me happy, perhaps that's,
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.700]   if it's fulfilling, of course eating Cheetos
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:13.400]   and watching soap operas is fulfilling for nobody whatsoever.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.380]   - Next question.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.700]   - But there's something about discipline
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.340]   that's more than that, which is,
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:23.100]   like the rigor of habit, right?
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:28.100]   You wake up early in the morning all the time.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:33.060]   What is it, Jordan Peterson talks about make your bed,
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.780]   one place where you probably agree with Jordan.
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.880]   - People ask me if I make my bed, I don't.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:40.660]   - Oh, there you go, there's a disagreement
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.940]   with Jordan Peterson. - Yeah, there we go.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.500]   You know, when I was younger, before I was married,
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.460]   I didn't make my bed because I had one sleeping bag on it,
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.180]   and I would get out of the sleeping bag,
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:55.260]   there was nothing to make.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:58.380]   Now I'm married and I can't make my bed
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.940]   'cause my wife's in my bed, so I don't make my bed.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:06.980]   - Okay, so what in your life, maybe we can talk about
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.260]   the one that's most publicly facing,
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.120]   which is you wake up at four o'clock,
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.420]   or around four o'clock in the morning,
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:19.420]   you post on social media a picture of your watch
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:23.500]   it being early just to remind people
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:28.340]   that you are man of your word.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:32.300]   What's that about, what's the philosophy of the four o'clock?
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.520]   What role does that play in a disciplined life for you?
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.460]   - Okay, from that perspective, what role it plays
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.960]   is getting a jump on the day.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.720]   And when you wake up early and you get a jump on the day
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.980]   and you've got your workout done
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.420]   and you've got a little bit of work done,
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:54.420]   by the time normal people are getting up, that's a win.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.160]   That's a psychological win,
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.760]   and it's not just a psychological win, it's an actual win.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.480]   It's an actual win.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.260]   So that feels great.
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.680]   It doesn't feel great maybe when your alarm clock goes off,
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.200]   but by eight o'clock in the morning
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.800]   and you've already accomplished some of the major tasks
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.080]   that you have, some of the most painful tasks
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.080]   that you have for the day, you're off to a great start
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.400]   and it's gonna feel great.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.000]   - Let's break this down then.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.160]   What does then the rest of the day look like?
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.160]   What is the perfect, productive, disciplined day
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.380]   in the life of Jocko Willink look like?
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:36.120]   - Wake up, workout.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.600]   - Wake up when?
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.000]   - Four, 4.30.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:39.840]   - Workout when?
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:44.600]   - Five, five to six or seven.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.760]   - No eating.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.600]   - No.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.640]   - And then what does the workout look like?
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.740]   - Depends on the day.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:52.060]   - What's the perfect?
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.960]   We're talking about body weight, lifting, cardio,
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.760]   heavy bag, jiu-jitsu.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.180]   - Okay, yeah, when I say workout, I mean no jiu-jitsu.
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.920]   So jiu-jitsu comes later in the day.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.640]   - So this is just you alone?
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.680]   - This is me alone working out, yep.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.540]   And I'm gonna be doing a wide variety of things.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.960]   - This is the thing that has the pictures of the aftermath
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.740]   with some sweat at the end.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.960]   So the goal is to do whatever the hell results in some sweat
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.540]   and that takes an hour.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.260]   - Sometimes it takes 12 minutes,
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.340]   sometimes it takes three hours
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:35.520]   depending on what kind of mood I'm in.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.100]   - You got some demons to work through
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.320]   or is this just work?
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:47.080]   So you got the David Goggins who clearly has demons
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.720]   screaming inside of his head
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.340]   that he's trying to work through.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.140]   Are you just getting the work done out of the discipline?
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:57.120]   I think Joe is a little bit with David Goggins
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.980]   is like there's some ego, there's some bullshit
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:02.380]   that you're trying to get out through some of the exercise.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.780]   That's a good way to kind of humble you
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:05.440]   is just doing that exercise.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.380]   - Well, exercise is certainly humbling.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.100]   I mean, but it's physical conditioning, right?
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.700]   It's preparing your body so that you can handle
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.480]   whatever it is you're gonna do.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.320]   - Perfect.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.420]   What do you do after?
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.380]   Let's talk about food.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:26.380]   - Hopefully surf if the waves are good.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.820]   - Surf for?
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.500]   - How good are the waves?
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.660]   - Let's say they're good.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:32.660]   This is a perfect day.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.900]   It's a perfect, perfect waves.
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:35.900]   Why do you surf?
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.260]   - It's fun.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:39.560]   - Okay, this is fun.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.780]   Okay, man and nature,
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:44.620]   which is like what surfing is the ultimate
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.420]   is the infinite power of the ocean
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:53.700]   versus a little silly looking man on a board.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.180]   - You could say it's the infinite power of the ocean
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:58.060]   versus a silly looking man on a board
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.360]   or you could say it's fun.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.660]   - 'Cause it's Russian and romance.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:05.340]   This is for fun in the morning, beautiful.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.020]   And this is you're still haven't eaten.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:07.860]   - No.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.420]   - Okay, so when do you eat?
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:14.120]   - I'll usually start grazing around 11 o'clock.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.900]   - And grazing, what's the diet?
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.740]   Is there a perfect diet or do you graze?
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:23.580]   - I'll eat some nuts, something like that.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.480]   I usually start grazing.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   Maybe I'll have a little piece of meat
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.960]   or something like that.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.540]   - Does work enter any of this?
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:32.120]   I'm sure you have a lot of people that want your attention.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.280]   - Yeah, yeah, no, work is about to happen.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.300]   'Cause even if I woke up at four,
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.560]   worked out from five to six, surf from six to eight,
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.240]   now I'm starting to work.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:50.240]   Writing, recording, reading, talking to clients.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.840]   - Is there parts of the day where you try to find moments
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:01.480]   to think deeply, to read deeply, to sort of really focus?
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.880]   'Cause this world is full of distractions, right?
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.640]   Even talking to, like even work stuff,
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.320]   the emails and all those kinds of things,
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:12.240]   they can scatter your mind.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.760]   Is there times you seek to have that focus?
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.440]   - Well, I read a lot of books.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.960]   And so usually when I read,
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.840]   I'll be reading for a chunk of time,
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.180]   maybe an hour at a time, maybe a little bit longer.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.580]   And I might do that twice a day.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.760]   So I don't know if that counts as what you're describing.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.680]   But then same thing with writing,
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.320]   when I'm writing something.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.520]   I mean, I just, that's what I do.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.120]   I write usually, usually write for about an hour.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.960]   I can get about a thousand words an hour out of me.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.780]   So that's sort of what I do.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:48.320]   - What does the rest of the day look like?
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.520]   Just a lot of work, but one is the jujitsu.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.160]   I want to find out about the jujitsu.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:56.320]   - So round four, 30 or five o'clock at night.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.320]   - You train. - Yep.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:01.720]   - And how hard?
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.560]   You still, how are you doing body-wise?
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.900]   Are you still, does the old man still got it or?
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.240]   - Are you talking to me?
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:16.880]   - It'd be good for viewership and ratings
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.760]   if I die before the end of the podcast, so.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.480]   - I still train with the same guys and I'll train, you know.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.440]   So I've been very lucky when it comes to getting injured
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.280]   and stuff like that.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   So I've had some injuries, but they're healed.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.600]   And so, yeah, I train.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.520]   - And food-wise, you mentioned grazing
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.280]   of some nuts, a very light kind of things.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.560]   Is there a main meal here?
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.880]   - Yeah, at night. - At night.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.680]   High in protein or is it anything?
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.440]   - Yeah, I'll have like a steak and salad.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.800]   I'll usually have, for dessert,
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.760]   I have like a protein shake, so.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:58.720]   - Is there a thing where at the end of the day,
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.720]   you have like a samurai sword and you meditate on death
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.880]   and all those kinds of, is there some weird ritual
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:09.800]   you partake in?
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.000]   - No. - Or you just go to bed?
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.480]   - When I get done with the end of the day,
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.040]   I might read a little bit more.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.960]   - Read more. - Yeah, because reading--
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.440]   - So read early on and read later.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:20.560]   - Reading makes me tired, usually.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.240]   So I'll read a little bit more.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.440]   - Is there a key to you that you can speak to
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.560]   that makes for a productive day?
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.760]   Just the way you approach it mentally?
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.520]   - Yeah, write down what you're supposed to do,
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.920]   wake up early and start doing it.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.640]   - And then get it done.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.360]   - Yeah, I know it's a miraculous trick.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.320]   - Can I ask you about jiu-jitsu?
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.360]   - By all means.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.840]   - What have you learned from being a practitioner?
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.720]   You're a black belt.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.880]   What have you learned from this journey
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.500]   of being a martial artist?
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:02.280]   - Jiu-jitsu for me was the connective tissue
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.740]   that started to join my mind together
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:08.120]   with all the different aspects of my life.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.220]   And so jiu-jitsu for me was really important,
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.960]   and I don't think I would be doing anything
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.480]   that I'm doing right now if it wasn't for jiu-jitsu.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.860]   So there's various aspects of my life
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:21.980]   that were in existence,
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.200]   but I didn't understand how they were connected
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.000]   until I started training jiu-jitsu.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.320]   The primary things are interacting with other human beings
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:35.320]   and combat tactics and strategy and jiu-jitsu,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.640]   and all those things are connected.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.040]   They all follow the same guiding principles,
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.040]   and I wouldn't have recognized those guiding principles
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.620]   if I didn't do jiu-jitsu.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.400]   - Can you elaborate?
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.800]   'Cause you've trained for many, many years.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:53.000]   Is it the hardship?
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.960]   Is it the humbling nature of just being tapped all over?
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.160]   Non-stop?
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.200]   I actually don't know how many times.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.120]   - I've tapped more times than you.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.600]   - Okay, so good.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.680]   Is it just the hardship of physical training,
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.700]   like the honesty of the mat in the sense that
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:11.600]   you know what works and what doesn't work?
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.520]   Which aspects were the most impactful for you?
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.520]   - All aspects.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.700]   So yes, from a humility perspective,
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:22.320]   when you realize, when you think you know what you're doing,
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.560]   when you think you have certain skills,
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.400]   and you realize that there's always somebody better than you
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.240]   and you realize that,
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.800]   hey, maybe I don't have all the answers all the time,
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.440]   and you bring that to a leadership perspective,
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.660]   and you walk into your platoon and you realize that
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:36.360]   maybe you don't have all the answers all the time,
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.840]   and maybe you should listen to what other people have to say,
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.140]   you bring that to a combat situation,
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.880]   and you realize that you think,
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.560]   if you sit there and think that you're smarter
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.240]   than the enemy, you're going to be complacent,
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.880]   you're going to make mistakes.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.340]   So there's one aspect, out of the gate,
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.520]   as far as, you know, if I'm going to try and get your arm,
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.140]   do I attack your arm?
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.920]   - Maybe not directly, unless I'm a white belt.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.760]   - Exactly.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.580]   What do I do?
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:09.000]   I attack your neck, and when you reach up to defend your neck
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.560]   that's when I get your arm.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.600]   Well, if I'm out on the battlefield
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.240]   and there's an enemy position,
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:17.320]   should I attack frontal assault into that position?
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.640]   - No.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.460]   - No, I shouldn't.
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.520]   I should put down some covering fire,
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.200]   and I should maneuver around to the flank.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.440]   It's the same thing.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.100]   If I'm dealing with you and you're my boss,
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.840]   and you've got a giant ego,
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.880]   and you've come up with a plan,
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:30.760]   and I don't like your plan,
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.000]   should I walk up to you and say,
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.200]   hey Lex, your plan isn't good?
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.040]   - No.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.840]   - Or should I say, hey Lex,
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.000]   can I ask you some questions
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.680]   about how you want us to execute this?
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.280]   'Cause I want to make sure I understand your vision.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:46.320]   So all these things are connected.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.160]   - Yes.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.000]   - And I wouldn't have realized that,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.200]   and we could sit here and do this forever.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.840]   We could, I could tell you these comparisons forever.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.320]   But this, all this connective tissue
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.040]   bringing all these things together,
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.360]   I wouldn't have seen it without,
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.400]   I don't think I would have seen it without jujitsu.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   So jujitsu to me had a incredible life impact on me.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.720]   Not, look, the physical part, yes, absolutely.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.560]   Does it keep you humble when you know
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.280]   that there's 145 pound individual
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.680]   that can tap you out when you're 220 pound,
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.240]   25 year old guy,
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:29.960]   and there's 135 or 140 pound,
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.920]   46 year old guy that can make you tap out?
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.480]   That's humbling.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.240]   And what do you do with that?
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.440]   Do you run away from it,
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.440]   or do you continue to pursue it?
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.000]   Same thing with life, same thing with anything.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.160]   So jujitsu is an incredibly powerful,
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.480]   not just physical aspect,
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.760]   but it's a way to understand, it's a way of thinking.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.080]   - You've also competed.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.160]   Is there something you can speak
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.520]   to the value of competition?
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.440]   Obviously you've been through combat,
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.880]   actual military combat is many, many,
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.360]   many orders of magnitude,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.800]   more high stakes than competition
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.040]   in a silly sport like jujitsu.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.880]   Nevertheless, it still has some of the echoes
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.960]   of the same challenges.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.960]   Is there something you can speak
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.520]   to the value of competition for you?
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.760]   - Yep, competition will reveal weaknesses in your game
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.920]   that you can then go back and train to rectify.
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:35.360]   - So that's very useful to sort of,
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.920]   yeah, as a testing ground.
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.440]   Of course, training can be that testing ground as well,
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.840]   or that feedback.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.440]   - Yeah, but as you and I both know,
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.720]   if you and I train together all the time,
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.280]   you'll know my game, I'll know your game.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.600]   And even if we have five other people,
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.960]   we all kind of understand each other's games.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.640]   And you're not doing something to me that I don't expect.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.280]   So when I go and compete,
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.800]   this random person has a game that I've never seen before.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.660]   And I may or may not know how to deal with that game.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.360]   If I know how to deal with it, great.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.120]   I get the victory, maybe I don't learn as much.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.920]   If I don't know how to deal with their game,
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.680]   I get the loss and I get the win of learning
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.320]   what some weakness in my game is.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.520]   - So you mentioned offline that you're friends
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.200]   and you work with Dean Lister.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.760]   Dean Lister is one of the people that inspired John Donaher,
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.940]   who I've very much been,
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.440]   I've gotten a chance to talk to quite a bit recently.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.480]   I don't know what you think about this.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.320]   This is not a therapy session, but.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.320]   - Looks like it's turning into one.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.640]   - It's turning into one.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.440]   He's a fascinating person, John Donaher,
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:53.440]   in terms of creating almost a science of jiu-jitsu
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.280]   to a level that I haven't seen before,
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.520]   which is systems thinking about,
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.240]   like you can think about military combat
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.440]   as tactics in a particular situation,
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.560]   but then you zoom out and you want to create
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:10.200]   entire systems of tactics in all situations.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.760]   He's very, kind of wants to keep zooming out
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.440]   and creating giant systems,
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.640]   and which I appreciate that,
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:20.960]   even though the task is probably impossible
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.440]   to do completely, but there is something
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.160]   that's in terms of competition that
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:35.060]   he kindled a fire in me that I want to get back out there.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.500]   He has a particular thing that did it,
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:43.080]   which is very different from my personal journey in jiu-jitsu
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:48.940]   which was to a degree that people I worked with
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.160]   cared about competition, it was always about winning
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.040]   and or doing well, all those kinds of things.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.840]   For John, it's about winning.
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.760]   That like winning is not even a thing that's important.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.400]   What's most important is winning by submission
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.960]   or dominance, right?
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.720]   And not just the end, it's the entire time competing
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.440]   such that the only thing that matters
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.800]   is that kind of victory.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.120]   And that's a very different level of competition
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.260]   that's actually liberating in a certain kind of sense.
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.840]   I remember so much of my competition
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.680]   was about kind of fear of not taking risks.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.400]   You get up on points or you hold a strong position,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.500]   you kind of advance and you get more points,
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.080]   maybe you chase the submission,
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.520]   but there's always a fear of risk.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.960]   And for him, you embrace the risk.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.540]   You should not be competing out of fear.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:56.800]   Live and die by the sword versus stay in safety.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.920]   I don't know if there's something to be said here.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.280]   - Well, I mean, this is not,
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.280]   you said it's novel to you, it's not novel to me.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.360]   The entire, my entire journey on jiu-jitsu,
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.880]   in jiu-jitsu was only about submission.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.720]   And as you mentioned, Dean Lister is my coach
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.960]   and my main training partner for 20 something years.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.520]   And if you ever watch Dean train or fight,
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.760]   that's what he's trying to do is submit as everyone.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.840]   That's what he's always done.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.360]   That's what he always will do.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.600]   He has the highest, I think he has,
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.800]   in fact, I know he has the highest submission victories
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.500]   in ADCC, that's what he does.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:42.500]   So this is, in fact, as jiu-jitsu got more popular
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:47.960]   and we started seeing people competing to win by points,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.840]   that was what was novel to me in the beginning.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.380]   Now it's the standard.
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.000]   So it's not novel to me.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.620]   I love the fact that John Donahuer
[01:43:57.620 --> 01:43:59.640]   and all of his troops go out
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.000]   and they try and submit people.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000]   I think it's awesome.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.040]   And I think that's what jiu-jitsu is.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.880]   - All right, let's ask for some advice for white belts.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.200]   There's a lot of white belts who listen to this.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.760]   What advice would you give,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.620]   you've been in jiu-jitsu for many years,
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:17.620]   in terms of a successful journey through jiu-jitsu,
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.720]   what advice would you give them, people just starting out?
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.800]   - Just keep training, keep your ego in check.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.320]   Don't freak out, try and use the techniques that you learn.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.080]   And all this stuff, I'm like saying it,
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.480]   notice how I'm saying it.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.440]   Hey, tap out, keep your ego in check.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.720]   And everyone, but the thing is, everyone says this all the time
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.440]   and white belts still start off by going completely nuts
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.400]   for at least three to six months of,
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.240]   I'm not going to let this guy tap me out
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.520]   and I'm going to tap this guy out,
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.200]   not by using technique, but by just using strength.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:49.500]   And it's just inhibiting your learning.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:50.720]   So as much as you can,
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.400]   I know you got to get it out of your system.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.400]   I know you don't want to tap
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:55.220]   and I know you want to tap somebody,
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:45:00.220]   but as soon as you get that off your chest,
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:03.660]   then try and relax and try and learn the techniques.
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:07.180]   - It's perhaps counterintuitive, it never was to me,
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:11.420]   but it's counterintuitive that to start on the journey
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:13.940]   of really sort of mastering jiu-jitsu or whatever,
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:16.600]   or improving, is you have to relax.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.540]   And that seems to be a very counterintuitive lesson.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:21.120]   I learned that early on with,
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:24.340]   that was thanks to the Russian system.
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:26.060]   I played piano and music,
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:29.780]   but basically actually, this is true for basically any sport
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:31.180]   that includes the human body,
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:34.760]   is like relaxing is the way you start learning stuff.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.860]   You have to learn, you have to literally,
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:38.620]   and most people don't seem to understand this,
[01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:41.380]   is like you have to learn what it means
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:43.240]   for the human body to relax.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.040]   Like, I guess you have to have enough knowledge
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.600]   of all the muscles involved
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.580]   to know what it means to relax those muscles.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:52.700]   So for piano, you have to understand
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:55.700]   what it means to relax your wrists and your fingers
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.860]   in order to learn how to move them.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.420]   Like, if there's tenseness in the fingers,
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:03.580]   you're not going to, like,
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:08.140]   you have to learn how to try hard while relaxed.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.120]   The, I guess the beginner,
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.220]   if you don't internalize this lesson,
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:17.180]   will try hard by tensing up hard,
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.740]   and like trying hard, tensing up more,
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.420]   as opposed to relaxing more.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:25.600]   And that lesson cannot be conveyed through words, I guess.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.140]   I've had the great fortune of having dictatorial teachers,
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:33.080]   as they do in Russia, for piano and so on,
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:36.740]   where you get, like, hit if you don't learn to relax,
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:39.860]   which is a counterintuitive notion, but it works.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.300]   - Yeah, this brings me to one of my favorite pieces
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:44.400]   of coaching advice that I will tell white belts
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.180]   while they're struggling on the mat.
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:48.360]   I'll tell them to relax harder.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.900]   (both laugh)
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.740]   - Okay.
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:54.500]   - That's beautiful.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:59.420]   For somebody who studied war, who participated in war,
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:03.760]   what do you think is the best martial arts for,
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.480]   let's call it self-defense,
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:12.900]   for hand-to-hand combat outside the constraints of sport?
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:15.480]   - So, it's not one answer.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:20.480]   The answer to me is jujitsu, boxing, wrestling,
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   Muay Thai, judo, sambo, and on down the list.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:29.760]   I definitely start with jujitsu.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.280]   The reason I start with jujitsu is
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.280]   because in a self-defense situation,
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.840]   if you are a big monster human and you wanna fight me
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.400]   and you square off with me, guess what I'm gonna do?
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:44.240]   Run away.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.200]   'Cause I don't wanna get involved.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:52.040]   Even if I see skinny little Lex out on the street
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.000]   and you start yelling at me and saying you wanna fight me,
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.440]   I don't wanna fight you.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.600]   It doesn't matter.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.000]   I don't care if I can beat you or not.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.080]   What if you stab me?
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.720]   What if you sue me after I get done
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:02.480]   throwing you onto the concrete?
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.440]   There's a million bad things that can happen
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:05.640]   and almost nothing good.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.320]   So, for self-defense, my first self-defense
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.960]   is my feet to get away from you.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.400]   And if you square off to punch me, I can run away from you.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.200]   If you square off to kick me, I can run away from you.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.880]   If you push me, I can run away from you.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.280]   So, great.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.720]   I don't need to know how to box to run away from you.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.180]   Where this all changes is when you grab me.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:33.560]   And now I don't have the option to run away anymore.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:38.360]   Now I actually have to know how to get away from your grip.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.080]   And that's where jujitsu comes into play.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.240]   So, especially if you get me on the ground,
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.200]   if you grab me and get me on the ground.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.060]   Now I need to know how to get you off of me
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:51.560]   and get up and get away from you so I can run away.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.120]   So, that's why I say start with jujitsu.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.120]   And from there, boxing, wrestling, judo, sambo, muay thai.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.280]   - Yeah, in the standing position,
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.160]   I mean, I'm a judo person as well.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.600]   And the judo is very limited in their understanding
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.280]   of the full grappling spectrum,
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.120]   even though they do all the things on the ground as well.
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.180]   But it's so focused on the feet.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:21.680]   But nevertheless, it's important to understand
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:27.200]   the thing that judo has as a sport,
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:30.720]   and it's good to practice, that jujitsu doesn't,
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.720]   is not just the skill of grappling on the feet,
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.980]   but the skill of explosive aggression.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:43.840]   That sometimes jujitsu is more about,
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.600]   in terms of tactics, is more about patience.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.000]   And I mean, it depends how you practice it,
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000]   but because so much is about control and technique,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.160]   that sometimes you don't get to practice aggression,
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.320]   explosive aggression.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.800]   And judo is so much about aggression implemented
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.160]   in such a way that the demonstration of power is effortless.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:09.040]   Right, that's the beauty of jujitsu.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.120]   - Yeah, and same thing with wrestling.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.480]   Wrestling also has a high level of intensity
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.320]   and aggression as well.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:14.160]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.560]   - So that's where I agree.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:19.120]   Judo and wrestling, absolutely.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.840]   Awesome, get some.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:23.800]   And striking, boxing, Muay Thai.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.760]   You should train all these things.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:31.080]   - Are there books and movies in your life,
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:33.600]   long ago or recently, that had a big impact on you?
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.560]   - Yeah, the main one is "About Face,"
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.180]   which is sitting right here.
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:41.280]   There you go.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.240]   This is written by Colonel David Hackworth.
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:48.080]   It's the book that really had a massive impact on me
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:50.020]   from a leadership perspective.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.640]   And I ended up, I talked about it enough
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.240]   that it started kind of coming back
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.320]   and started selling well.
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:58.200]   And they contacted me and I wrote a forward for it.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.480]   So that book had a huge impact on me.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:04.200]   And I still, when I read it,
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.240]   I still get lessons out of it just about every time.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.160]   - This is the Vietnam War.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.120]   - And Korea.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.680]   - And Korea.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:14.200]   - And he got in towards the end of,
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.880]   right at the end of World War II.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.780]   So he was kind of raised by the soldiers
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.640]   that fought in World War II.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.920]   And then he went to Korea and then he went to Vietnam.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.160]   - An exceptional warrior, a soldier's soldier.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.920]   If you can give a little inkling,
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.720]   what made him a soldier's soldier?
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:39.220]   - So he died in 2005.
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.560]   So I never got to meet him.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:46.440]   And I had a guy on my podcast who worked for him in Vietnam,
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:51.680]   a guy named General James Mukayama.
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:55.980]   And luckily his son had reached out to me and said,
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:59.160]   "I think you're talking about my dad."
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.720]   'Cause I read some passage in there
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.000]   that Jim Mukayama was young captain Jim Mukayama,
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.520]   company commander in Vietnam.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.820]   He said, "I think you're talking about my dad.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.100]   Would you want to talk to him?"
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.820]   And I said, "Absolutely."
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:14.260]   Well, here's the thing that I didn't really understand.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.260]   And you read one quote,
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:17.500]   but there's all these quotes in that book
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.820]   that talk about how great Hackworth was
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:22.340]   and what an incredible leader he was
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:23.980]   and how he was the best combat leader
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:24.900]   anyone had ever seen.
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.100]   And all these just really complimentary things
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.500]   that are said by a bunch of different people.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.260]   And when you read the book,
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:34.220]   you're reading this guy's account of what he went through.
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:40.280]   But I never really knew if that was all true
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:44.240]   or did he just cherry pick his friends quotes about him
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:47.360]   and cherry pick the stories that he wanted to tell.
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.340]   And so it was very interesting for me
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:52.960]   when I met Mukayama, General Mukayama,
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.720]   he became a general eventually.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.120]   When I met him and we were talking about his life
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.880]   and I was very curious and I was a little bit nervous
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.800]   going into this interview because I was thinking
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.320]   maybe my hero, my mentor,
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.960]   this guy that I've never met before,
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.800]   maybe he's just an arrogant jerk
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.020]   that talked himself up in this book.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:15.220]   So I'm sitting down with General Mukayama
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.980]   and I finally got to the part where he's meeting Hackworth
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:20.740]   for the first time.
[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:25.740]   And I said, "Did you know who Hackworth was
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.780]   when he showed up?"
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:30.580]   So he was Mukayama, Muk, they call him Muk.
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:35.580]   Muk was the, like the adjutant to the general.
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:39.740]   That was going to, that Hackworth was gonna be working for.
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.300]   So when Hackworth comes into the office,
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:43.020]   the first person he meets is this guy,
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:44.520]   this guy, Captain Mukayama.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:47.540]   And so Hackworth walks in and I said,
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:51.780]   "When Hackworth walked in, did you know who he was?"
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:55.140]   And Mukayama says, "Everybody knew who he was,
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:57.100]   Mr. Infantry."
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:00.540]   And so he ended up explaining that everything
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:03.240]   that is written in there about Hackworth,
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:05.080]   they just loved him, they adored him.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:10.220]   Up the chain of command,
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.620]   it turned out a little bit different.
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:13.660]   And the title of the book is "About Face"
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:16.540]   and if you're familiar with military drill,
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:19.260]   about face is when you turn around 180 degrees.
[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:20.960]   And at the end of the Vietnam War,
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:24.300]   towards the end of the Vietnam War,
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:26.620]   he was so disgusted with the way
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.000]   that the war was being fought.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.060]   He was so disgusted with the decisions
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:32.020]   that were being made by the leadership
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:33.080]   that he did an interview.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.540]   He was the first colonel, first senior officer
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:40.260]   to do an interview that spoke out against the war
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:41.100]   that was happening.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:43.180]   And this is while he's in Vietnam, by the way.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.460]   So he got drummed out of the army
[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:49.100]   and he was forced to retire and that was that.
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:53.360]   So there's an element of rebelliousness to him.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.140]   And when you talk to me about,
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:59.980]   are there times when the leaders making the leadership,
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:02.020]   this absolute senior leadership,
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.880]   the civilian leadership is doing the wrong things?
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.960]   Yes.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.920]   And there's times when people speak out against it.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:09.720]   And there's an argument for and against that too,
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.140]   even with Hackworth.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.460]   When you quit your job or you do something
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.520]   that gets you fired, which is what he did,
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.980]   you immediately give up all your influence
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.460]   over what's happening.
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:25.560]   So they get another battalion commander to take his place.
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.100]   They get another colonel to step in and take his place.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.500]   That's what they do.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:29.840]   And now he can't help anymore.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.560]   He can't help his troops.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.560]   But at that point in the war, he loved his men so much
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:43.240]   that he was sickened with the situation on the ground.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:45.960]   And he spoke out about it.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.680]   So that book had a huge impact on me.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.120]   And like I said, I still read it all the time.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.920]   I reread it all the time.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.320]   And I always take lessons from it.
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:58.800]   - Let me ask you about love.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:00.580]   This is not usually associated with Jocko,
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:05.000]   but what role does love in terms of friendship,
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.280]   in terms of family, play in a successful life,
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.380]   in life in general?
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:13.200]   - Again, this is putting other people above yourself.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.400]   - Do you see that as love?
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:18.280]   That's ultimately the implementation of love.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.520]   - I would say, yes.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.600]   - Jocko, I've been a huge fan of yours.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.480]   You're somebody who inspires me to get up early,
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.220]   to get shit done, to be disciplined about my life,
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.380]   and to be the best leader I can be.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:35.060]   It's really truly an honor.
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:39.820]   And thank you for wasting all your too valuable time with me.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:40.980]   I don't know what you were thinking,
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.620]   but thank you for doing it.
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:43.900]   - Well, thanks for having me on.
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:47.240]   I can guarantee I'm not as cool as you just made me sound.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:51.460]   I'm just out here, like I said, trying to help people out.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.160]   And I think you're helping a lot of people out
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.000]   with your podcast.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.100]   So thanks for having me up here
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:58.140]   to share some of my experiences.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.140]   - And hopefully I'll see you on the mat one day.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.860]   - For sure, looking forward to it.
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:03.180]   Could be sooner than you think.
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:04.100]   (laughing)
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.380]   - That sounds like a threat.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:06.940]   I love it.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:08.460]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.540]   with Jocko Willink.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:13.300]   And thank you to Linode, Indeed, Simply Save,

[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.580]   from Jocko Willink.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:25.700]   There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.
[01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:29.340]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:31.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:44.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
