[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   How do you think about whether it makes sense to slowly invest over time,
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.840]   invest all up front, or even potentially kind of hold out and wait for the market
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.400]   to drop and try to buy at the bottom?
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.040]   What is the maximum theoretical value going to tell you?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.800]   And then there's what should you actually do?
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   And what you should actually do is not necessarily the thing
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.760]   that's going to maximize to the scent of the expected value of your portfolio.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.480]   Like you have to behave in a way that makes sense to you,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.720]   that you're comfortable with.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   If you're sitting ready to invest, but you haven't invested a lot now,
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.120]   investing everything at once and then seeing the ups and downs
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.800]   in the portfolio as the market moves around, that may be a very painful experience.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   If you're not used to seeing that,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.040]   that would be an argument to step in a little bit at a time.
