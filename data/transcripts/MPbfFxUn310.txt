[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.740]   - Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.040]   with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.280]   And a listener named Matt writes in,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.120]   Pastor John, 1 Corinthians chapter seven and verse five
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.360]   says that a husband and wife should quote,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.200]   "Not deprive one another of sexual relations,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.580]   "except perhaps by agreement for a limited time,
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.920]   "that you may devote yourselves to prayer."
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.640]   My question is how does our sex life interfere
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.080]   with our prayer life?
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.600]   And when should there be a time
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.560]   in which a couple takes a break
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.360]   so as to devote themselves to prayer?
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.400]   Is this like the principle of fasting
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.120]   where the desire for sexual relations
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.780]   is meant to put our focus back on the Lord
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.460]   to remind us that he is our ultimate joy
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.900]   and satisfaction above all else?
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.260]   Pastor John, what would you say to Matt?
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.400]   - Okay, let's get the whole verse in front of us.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.320]   Matt leaves out the last half,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.600]   which really creates a helpful paradox.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.640]   At least I have loved it
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120]   ever since I first struggled with it.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.720]   Here's the whole verse.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.440]   Do not deprive one another,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.960]   except perhaps by agreement for a limited time.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440]   That means deprive one another from sexual relations.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.760]   Do not deprive one another from sexual relations,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.000]   except perhaps by agreement for a limited time,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.560]   that you may devote yourselves to prayer.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.380]   And that's where he stops.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.560]   Here's the rest of it.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   But then come together again
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.580]   so that Satan may not tempt you
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.860]   because of your lack of self-control.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.120]   Now, what's paradoxical about this
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   is that on the one hand,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.720]   Paul sees the suspension of sexual relations
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.600]   as a means of intensified devotion to prayer,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.520]   presumably because the couple wants a breakthrough
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.780]   in some answer to prayer
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.640]   because the devil is doing something
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.600]   they don't want him to do,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.040]   and they want to resist the devil,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.000]   resist unrighteousness that he's promoting.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.200]   And so abstaining from sexual relations for prayer
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.500]   is a way of making war on Satan.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.360]   But then on the other hand,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.080]   Paul says the married couple should come back together
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.000]   and continue to have sexual relations
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.660]   so that Satan may not tempt you,
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.660]   which means that the regular relations in marriage
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.580]   is a weapon against Satanic triumphs.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.800]   So abstaining from sexual relations for prayer
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.360]   is a weapon against Satan,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.600]   and carrying on regular sexual relations
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.280]   is a weapon against Satan, and that's the paradox.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.920]   And I think this is really important to see
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   because it means that in God's design
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.940]   of the world and of human life,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.980]   his pattern for ordinary things like sleeping,
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.820]   exercising, eating, sexual relations in marriage,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.300]   all have their place in maintaining
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.820]   appropriate spiritual equilibrium
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.780]   that keep us from being knocked off balance by Satan.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.640]   For example, a sleepless person is more vulnerable
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.700]   to the Satanic attack of depression and impatience.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.580]   A person who goes for a long time without food
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.820]   may be vulnerable to the temptations of gorging
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.100]   or stealing or irritability.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.180]   In the ordinary course of life,
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.180]   God's design for the human body has spiritual implications
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.020]   as well as physical ones,
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.500]   which means that the first thing to say about our sex lives
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   is not that it interferes with our prayer lives,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.700]   but that it may provide protection from Satanic attack
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.560]   against our prayer lives.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.320]   A satisfied sexual pattern in marriage
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.120]   may free the mind for prayer
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   and triumph over temptations to adultery
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.920]   or other kinds of sexual sin.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.320]   And of course, I should say in passing,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.520]   he didn't ask this,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.220]   that God has other strategies of purity
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.360]   and glorifying him for people
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.220]   with unsatisfactory sexual lives in marriage.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.720]   We got a question, I know, in this recent batch
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.760]   from a man who said, "We haven't had sex for five years."
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.160]   Well, that God has a special grace for,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.640]   and single people who must read this text and say,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.160]   "Well, that's not helpful.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.080]   A regular pattern of sexual relations
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.560]   protect you from the devil, I'd like that."
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.520]   Well, God has other glorious gifts
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.080]   for people who don't have this particular gift.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.160]   So what about Matt's question?
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.720]   His question was, "My question is,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.280]   how do our sex lives interfere with our prayer lives?"
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.040]   And you can see that that's not the way
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.280]   I would ask the question,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.200]   but it is an understandable way of putting the question
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.960]   since Paul says, "Do not deprive one another,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.380]   except perhaps by agreement for a limited time,
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.460]   that you may devote yourselves to prayer."
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.040]   So I think Matt is on the right track
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.720]   in suggesting that Paul sees this as a kind of fasting,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   not from food, but from the ordinary pleasures of sex.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.760]   And the point of fasting is to say
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.880]   in a more intensified way with our bodies,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.920]   that we as a couple, a married couple,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   are deeply earnest in what we are seeking God for
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.160]   in our prayer.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.360]   In essence, we're saying,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.000]   we abstain from sexual pleasures of sex for a season
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.680]   in order to pray and to show with our body's denial
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.740]   how desperate we are for an answer to this prayer.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.740]   I think that's where Matt was going
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.560]   in his suggested solution, and I think he's right.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.520]   Or there's another take on it.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   The abstinence may be less planned than that,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.560]   and simply a response to some terrible news that we get.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.780]   For example, you and your spouse may be planning
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.780]   a special evening that might climax in sexual relations,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.620]   and you're looking forward to it,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.460]   and you get a phone call about the injury of your child
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.940]   in another state, say a college student,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.620]   or some deep marital difficulty in some friend.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.260]   You get a call, a desperate call,
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.300]   and you just don't have the emotional and physical
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.380]   wherewithal to pursue intimacy that night.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.860]   You just give yourself to prayer for your child
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.100]   or for your friend.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.540]   Either way, planned or unplanned,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.740]   the point is not that sex is evil
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.060]   or that it is a hindrance to the ordinary life of prayer.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.060]   The point is that every legitimate pleasure we enjoy
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.340]   may be given up for a season to underline
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.900]   our intensity of desire for answered prayer
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.540]   or to show our emotional empathy
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.740]   for someone who is suffering.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.860]   - Yeah, interesting paradox and very helpful.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.660]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for the question, Matt.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.100]   Of course, for all of you who are listening,
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.500]   thank you for listening to the podcast

[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.740]   about how a particular passage
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.060]   relates to everyday life and marriage.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.700]   You can do all of that through our online home

[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.500]   Tomorrow we hear from an older believer
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.700]   who trusts in Christ,
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.220]   but whose life feels entirely pointless
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.580]   at this stage of his life.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.300]   So what word does Pastor John have to a man
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.900]   who feels like he's just passing time in this life?
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.980]   Well, that's what we're gonna talk about next.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.160]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.600]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.960]   listening in.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.440]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.300]   We'll see you all on Wednesday.
