[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Does John Piper deny personal assurance?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.440]   Today we need to address a quote that's found its way all over the internet, attributed
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.160]   to you, Pastor John.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.920]   It was brought to my attention by two listeners, the first, Taylor.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.920]   "Hello, Pastor John, I recently read a critique of you saying that you deny assurance of salvation.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   Here's the exact quote attributed to you."
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.360]   No Christian can be sure that he is a true believer."
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.360]   Is this true?
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.560]   Did you say this?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.600]   The second email comes from a listener named Willis.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.080]   "Dr. Piper, hello and thank you for your sermons.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.560]   In a recent sermon, our teaching pastor used the following quote attributed to you.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.680]   According to him, you wrote this, 'No Christian can be sure that he is a true believer.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360]   Hence, there is an ongoing need to be dedicated to the Lord and to deny ourselves so that
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080]   we might make it.'"
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.040]   I can't find this quote in your books.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   I can't find it online at DG.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.520]   Best I can tell, this quote came from a booklet published in 1997 by you and the BBC pastoral
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.120]   staff titled, "Tulip, What We Believe About the Five Points of Calvinism," position paper
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.400]   of the pastoral staff, page 25.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.760]   I can't find the original document anywhere.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.560]   Regarding this quote, did you write it?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.160]   And second, do you deny that a Christian can actually experience the full assurance of
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.600]   salvation in this life?
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.800]   Pastor, what would you say to Taylor and to Willis?
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.240]   Well, there are lessons here, aren't there?
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   There are lessons.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   Yes.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.600]   And the first lesson is, if you hear somebody say something, not just me, if you hear somebody
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   say something about another person that seems to you totally out of step, out of character,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.400]   contrary to what you know about them, what you know about their theology, it is perfectly
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.000]   fitting to ask the pastor, the teacher, the blogger to provide sources for the claims
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.280]   that they make so that you can verify them.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.240]   That's lesson number one.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.160]   So we're talking here about two sentences.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.360]   Number one, Piper said, "No Christian can be sure that he is a true believer," sentence
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.760]   number two.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.080]   "Hence," that's an important word, "hence there is an ongoing need to be dedicated to
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   the Lord and to deny ourselves so that we can make it."
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.440]   Now as far as I know, I have never said or written the first sentence, "No Christian
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.600]   can be sure that he is a true believer."
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.280]   I've looked everywhere, tried to figure out, is there some context in which I said it,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.600]   did I find it anywhere?
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.280]   And not only that, I don't believe it, so there you go, I don't believe it's true, which
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.120]   is probably why I never said it.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.840]   But not only that, when you search all, what, 10,000 Piper documents or so at Desiring God,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.160]   and just go ahead and search any part of that sentence, you won't find it.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   At least I couldn't.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.360]   I couldn't either.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.240]   So if anybody out there knows where I said that, tell us.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.800]   I'd like to fix it if I did.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.960]   But I'm not aware of saying it or writing it, so I'm assuming I didn't.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.640]   But here's the problem with the second sentence.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.240]   The problem with the second sentence is the word "hence."
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.480]   It says, "Hence there is an ongoing need to be dedicated to the Lord and to deny ourselves
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.960]   so that we might make it."
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.360]   In other words, I'm not only being described as a person who denies that we can have full
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:55.200]   assurance of salvation, but I'm being described as a person who says that this impossibility
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   of having assurance is the reason that there is an ongoing need to be dedicated to the
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.560]   Lord and to deny ourselves so that we can make it.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.400]   And I assume they mean make it to final salvation in the age to come.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.320]   Now what should we say about that?
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:25.040]   I do in fact believe that we must be dedicated to the Lord and we must deny ourselves in
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.440]   order to fight the fight of faith and not commit apostasy and not make shipwreck of
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.960]   our faith lest we perish.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   That's true.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.200]   I do believe that.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.080]   But it's not true that I believe that because we can't have assurance.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.360]   That's not the reason I believe that second sentence.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.560]   It's true because it's what the Bible teaches, just as the Bible teaches that we can and
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.800]   should have full assurance.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   So I wonder—this is a guess now—I wonder if what is going on is that someone read that
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:08.640]   Piper believes you must fight the fight of faith, you must put sin to death in order
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.000]   to persevere to the end and be saved.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.320]   And then inside their own head, they can't conceive of such a viewpoint, of such a fight
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.920]   of faith, unless one denies assurance.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.440]   So Piper must deny assurance because otherwise he wouldn't say that.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.720]   In other words, maybe somebody reasoned like this.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   Piper actually speaks threats to believers in his congregation.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.880]   He warns them.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   He speaks to his whole church and warns them that if they don't put sin to death, they
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.920]   might go to hell.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.400]   And therefore, Piper clearly does not believe in eternal security, and it follows that he
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.280]   doesn't believe people can have assurance.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.760]   Now, all of that reasoning is wrongheaded and unbiblical.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   Certainly not my reasoning.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.720]   It's not the Bible's reasoning.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   That's bad theology reasoning.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.040]   It's illogical reasoning.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.760]   It's unbiblical reasoning.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.040]   I do believe in eternal security.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.960]   I do believe that assurance is possible and enjoyed by believers, and I do believe that
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.040]   one should say to a congregation of Christians that if they don't put sin to death, they're
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.360]   going to go to hell.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   That's not a contradiction.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.720]   It's not a contradiction of eternal security, because those who are truly born of God will
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.320]   take the threat to heart and put sin to death.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.880]   Those who are fake Christians, they'll blow it off, and they'll say, "Oh, we don't need
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.800]   to hear any threats."
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.160]   That's evidence that they don't know their Bibles, and they may not be born of God.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:50.200]   In fact, such biblical warnings and threats are one of the means God uses to keep his
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:07:00.320]   people safe and preserve them to the end in the joy of faith and in the strength of assurance.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.520]   So let's put some Bible under all that.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.000]   Hebrews 6:11, "We desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.920]   assurance of hope to the end."
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.240]   Hebrews 10:22, "Let us draw near with a heart of full assurance of faith."
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.960]   Colossians 2:2, "Paul prays that our hearts may be encouraged and knit together in love
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.120]   to reach the riches of the full assurance of understanding."
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.800]   Romans 8:14, "All who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.840]   You didn't receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.000]   You've received the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.360]   The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.600]   Glory!
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.300]   How would you survive in the Christian life without that kind of assurance?
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:03.480]   So I believe, have always believed, as far as I can remember, that to my knowledge, I've
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.240]   never written or said anything contrary to what I just read, those Bible verses.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:18.000]   Christians can and should enjoy the assurance that we are the children of God.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.420]   And if children, then heirs, because, Romans 8:30, "Those whom he predestined he called,
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.040]   and those whom he called he justified, and those whom he justified he glorified."
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.440]   In other words, we can have assurance not just that we are God's justified children
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:45.800]   now, but that God will see to it with his omnipotent keeping power that we remain the
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.480]   children of God forever, all the way to glory and beyond.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.400]   Now without any contradiction, the Bible also says to these very spirit-assured children
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:08.200]   of God in Romans 8, verse 13, just before those texts about assurance, "If you live
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.340]   according to the flesh, you will die, Christian.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.000]   But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live, Christian."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.640]   And Hebrews says, "Strive for the holiness, Christian, without which no one will see the
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.620]   Lord," Hebrews 12:14.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.720]   And Jesus said, "If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out, throw it away, for
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.520]   it is better for you to lose one of your members," namely your eye, "than for your
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.920]   whole body to be thrown into hell," Matthew 5:29.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.560]   And Paul said to the Roman church, "They were broken off."
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.760]   Those Jewish unbelievers were broken off because of their unbelief.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.560]   You stand fast through faith, so do not become proud, but fear, for if he didn't spare
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.080]   the natural branches, neither will he spare you, Romans 11:20.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.800]   In other words, the Bible teaches us, give warnings to each other.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.960]   Pastors, give warnings to your people.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.760]   Scare the hell out of your people.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.560]   And I mean that with strict literalness.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.680]   There's hell in your people that will take them to hell if you don't scare the hell
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.960]   out of your people.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.040]   Now, don't quote this out of context.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.240]   Like, Piper really loves promises more than he loves threats.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.440]   But, oh, I'm a Bible guy.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.520]   I'm a Bible guy.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.680]   I'm going to talk the way the Bible talks.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.280]   It says, "Don't throw away your confidence."
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.680]   I mean, look at your people with tears in your eyes, and look at those who are worldly
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.080]   and are drifting into sin, are completely consumed with the media that they're all
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.320]   watching every night, and plead with them, "Don't throw away your confidence, which
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.760]   has great reward."
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.480]   So warning, pursue holiness, because if you don't, you won't see the Lord.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.280]   Tear your eye out to avoid lust, because if you don't, you're going to go to hell with
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.840]   both eyes.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.240]   That's the way preachers should preach, and small groups should talk to each other.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:14.680]   Now, those warnings are in the Bible not to destroy assurance.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.320]   So maybe this is where it all came from.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.620]   Maybe somebody heard me talking about warnings, and they said, "Well, that guy surely does
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:27.020]   not believe in security, surely does not believe in assurance," which is just baloney.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.840]   They don't have any biblical sense when they talk like that.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.120]   So let me start that over again.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:40.040]   Those warnings are in the Bible not to destroy assurance, but to prevent false assurance.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:47.480]   People who think that they are on their way to heaven, but who don't hate their sin and
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.680]   fight it, are deluded.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.200]   They should not have assurance.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:02.160]   So the warnings are a life-giving, soul-saving litmus test to help us born-again people hear
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.920]   the warnings.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:12.440]   They tremble, they turn to Christ for forgiveness and for the power to kill sin, and in that
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:21.040]   turning—this is my last sentence, it's so important—in that turning to Christ,
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:30.220]   and in that resolve to kill sin in the power of Christ, the Spirit bears witness that they
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.120]   are the children of God.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.200]   It's not based on their perfection.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.760]   It's based on that sweet inclination, "I'm turning to Jesus, and in the power and the
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.280]   love of Jesus, I'm hating my sin and I'm killing it every day," and thus the Spirit
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.880]   causes them to enjoy the sweet experience of assurance.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   Amen.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.920]   So don't believe everything on the internet.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   No, my—no, don't.
