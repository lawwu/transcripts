[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.360]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's live Q&A.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.280]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.400]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.160]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160]   I might have to change that.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.160]   It's a tough time.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   Who knows?
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160]   Actually, you know what?
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160]   Let's keep a good attitude.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.240]   Let's talk about how to build financial freedom in 10 years or less, even in the midst of
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.340]   where we are right now.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.340]   Live Q&A show today.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.340]   A bunch of callers on the line.

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.240]   I don't want to waste any time today, so we're going to begin with Justin in Chicago.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240]   Justin, welcome.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   No problem.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   You're live.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240]   I had two questions for you.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   The first one is I have a family member who is currently in Costa Rica, trying to come
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240]   back, I think tomorrow, and that's been canceled.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   So now trying to get flights out later this week.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.840]   I was just going to see if you had any thoughts on should she have tried to come home early
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   amidst the news?
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440]   Do you think she should stay put and try to make accommodations there?
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.760]   Is she living in Costa Rica or is she just simply traveling in Costa Rica on a short
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   term?
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.800]   She went for a one-week trip, kind of in the middle of all this.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.040]   And why was the flight canceled?
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   Why couldn't she get out?
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   I'm not sure why the first flight was canceled.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   It may have been like an availability thing.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.080]   I'm not exactly sure, but the flight she was supposed to come back on was canceled.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.560]   Has the airline rebooked her?
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.440]   Yeah, she's been rescheduled to another flight.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.640]   So what's the problem then?
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.000]   Why shouldn't she just take the flight?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.640]   So I guess mainly I was curious because she's recovering from illness and is in her 60s.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.280]   So I was thinking about just trying to avoid contact with folks.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.560]   Well, there's not really an option for her.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.240]   If she was living in Costa Rica or she had friends in Costa Rica, then of course she
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.400]   could stay in Costa Rica.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.520]   But Central America, just like almost anywhere, is shut down.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.900]   So she has three ways to get from Costa Rica to the United States.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.160]   She can fly, she can drive, or she can take a boat.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.240]   She ain't going to drive.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.320]   All the borders are closed.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.440]   Mexico-US border is now closed.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.120]   Of course, if she's a US citizen, she could get in that one.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.360]   But I don't know if the Mexican border is closed right now, but Honduras is closed.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.400]   El Salvador is closed.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800]   Guatemala is closed.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000]   Costa Rica is closed.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.400]   Costa Rica would let her out, but Costa Rica is closed.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.480]   Panama is closed.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.880]   Panama is canceling all flights, all international flights on Sunday.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   So she's not – generally, of course, she could drive up, but too late for that.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.880]   And so her only options are to fly or to take a boat.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.140]   There's no practical boat scenario, and so I think she has no choice but to fly.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.680]   So if she's been sick, if she has coronavirus or has the symptoms of it, then obviously
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.000]   she owes it to her fellow passengers to not fly to get treatment until she recovers, and
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.840]   she can do that in Costa Rica.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.520]   But if she just has a cold or something like that, then have her wear and acquire a mask
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.320]   to protect her fellow passengers, to maintain distance, but I don't see any option that
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.800]   she has but to get home.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.680]   I don't see any other choice for her at this point.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.200]   All right, awesome.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.240]   Thanks so much.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Any other questions before you go?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.320]   I know I've got a date for you.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   Okay, great.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.440]   All right, we move on to – looks like Pennsylvania.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   Welcome to the show.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   How can I serve you today?
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   Hey there, Joshua.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440]   This is a guy in Pennsylvania.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   Good to talk to you, sir.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   You too, sir.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   Go ahead.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   I have a simple tax return question, and the question is where you would best suggest that
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   I would put these funds.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.160]   My wife and I have been talking about it for a few weeks now.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.440]   We were talking about this before everything has happened with coronavirus, and now I think
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.640]   this probably changes the conversation a little bit.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.480]   So essentially, just to kind of outline where we're at, we're in ministry, so I'm employed
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.840]   at a church, and she is a freelance writer, very minimal.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   She makes about $500 a month.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.240]   And so I look at our income as, especially in times like these, as fairly high risk,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.040]   because if the community stops making income, the church stops making income, I stop making
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   income.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   So I have a tax return coming.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.760]   We are, as a family, we are debt-free except for our mortgage.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.560]   We have an $86,000 mortgage.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.520]   And with this $7,000 tax return coming, we're married with three small children, four, two,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.320]   and one.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.600]   And where we've been discussing is whether or not those funds should go into our emergency
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.240]   cash savings to beef that up, or if they should go towards paying off our mortgage faster
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.000]   or towards what we consider our Kids' Future Fund, which is where we're saving for things
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.800]   like college or whatever else may come up, but it's not in a 529 or anything like that.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.000]   So I just kind of wanted a little bit of your guidance on what you would suggest.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.400]   At the moment, our income is going to continue to come in.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.520]   You know, I'm still working.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.760]   Our church is moving online, things like that.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.480]   We have $4,500 in our emergency preparedness fund right now.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.960]   $3,000 of that is in a money market account, and $1,000, $1,500 of that is in $50 bills
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.040]   in the gun safe.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.760]   So we have that cash on hand.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.080]   So I just kind of wanted to feel you out for what your thoughts and what your suggestions
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.640]   were on where we should launch that money.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:38.440]   If I were in your shoes, I would go to the ATM and I would withdraw the $3,500 from the
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.640]   money market account.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.440]   I would add that and $50 and $20 bills to the money that's in my gun safe, and when
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.480]   I receive the $7,000 tax refund, I would take that to the bank and I would turn it into
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.720]   physical currency.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.400]   I hope that that's overreacting.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.760]   I hope that that is unnecessary, but at this point in time, my concern grows day by day,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.840]   and I don't see, except unless we have some miracle treatment that proves to be effective.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.200]   For example, in the last couple of days, there's a lot of excitement about chloroquine and
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   other treatments, and I think that's great.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.600]   If some miracle treatment comes out in the next few days, I will be thrilled with that,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:31.760]   but barring that, I see no reason not to do what I've just said.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   That's what I would do.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:42.440]   >>Trevor: So your recommendation is to up my cash on hand to around $10,000, and had
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.200]   we not been in this scenario, would you suggest any differently?
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.000]   I've listened to a lot of your episodes where you're suggesting more cash on hand than I
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   have.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.400]   >>Dave: Had we not been in this scenario, would I have suggested differently?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.880]   Probably, a little bit, but I would have thought about the other options.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.440]   I would have worked it through.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.200]   I would have considered the benefits and the drawbacks, et cetera, and I probably would
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.820]   have arrived at a similar conclusion.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:15.960]   If you had a total emergency savings of $12,000, I'd be nervous about all of that $12,000 under
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.600]   normal situations, no global pandemic.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:27.640]   I'd be a little nervous about all of that $12,000 being in physical cash because that
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:35.920]   puts you at risk of a security risk if your safe is broken into, if you have a home fire.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.760]   It's too risky to have all your money in cash in that scenario if that represents all of
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760]   your savings.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:49.080]   In addition, it's a risk for just simply the administrative complexity of paying bills.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.760]   It's very valuable to have digital emergency funds that can be quickly put in a checking
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.520]   account that you can make an electronic transfer, et cetera.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.360]   I would have probably still steered you towards saving it just in emergency funds, not a college
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.280]   account, not paying extra on your mortgage because I'd rather you have $12,000 being
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.920]   the father of three children than $5,000.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.400]   I probably still would have steered you in that direction.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.760]   Of course, in normal times, I would have said, "Spend some of the money.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   There's no reason.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.280]   Perhaps, there's something that you've been waiting for and maybe an extra $2,000 is spent.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   That's reasonable."
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.040]   But in the current scenario, I would do it as I said.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   While you're waiting on that tax refund check, I would go to the bank.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.480]   I would make some ATM distributions and I would take out the money that was in my money
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.160]   market account and turn it into physical currency.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.480]   Then when I received the tax refund check, I would also turn that into physical currency.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.600]   There's no downside risk to that other than the risk of loss.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.680]   So I would diversify it.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.860]   Put some in your gun safe and bury some in the backyard or put some at your mom's house
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.560]   or something like that so that it's not all exposed to the risk of loss, not all exposed
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.120]   to a house fire, et cetera.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.200]   But I think that's where we are and I think that that move at this point in time is clearly
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   justified.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.840]   Okay, I appreciate that.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   And then kind of the same thing, if we get that, which it looks like they're going to
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.280]   pass cash to every American household, kind of handle that in the same way.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.320]   You'd suggest or maybe do a little bit of digital beyond that.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.320]   I don't mind.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.680]   You need some digital money just to pay bills, right?
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.960]   So if you still have income and whatnot, that's fine.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:43.160]   And I don't want to – I'm trying to figure out how to clearly convey my concern, which
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.400]   grows day by day.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.360]   I have just – prior to this call, I've just spent an hour sitting and talking to
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.960]   my wife, talking through all the reasons why I'm wrong, all the reasons why I'm overreacting
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.520]   and the conclusion was that I can't find it.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.880]   And when I conclude this Q&A call, I have a significant amount of cash and I'm going
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.080]   to the bank to withdraw more.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.160]   So I hate that.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.040]   I hate that we're there, but I'm concerned that within the next few days, those kinds
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:18.000]   of things will start to be more apparent and you need to be early.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.440]   So if I'm overreacting, I don't see much of a cost to you if I'm overreacting.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.960]   I don't have any cost to me if I'm overreacting.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.000]   And so that's as clearly as I can say.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.160]   Yeah, I appreciate it because they're trying to prevent a run on the bank.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.400]   Of course, of course they are.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.500]   But the reason they're trying to prevent it is because there's more significant danger
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.480]   right now than there has ever been.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:50.640]   And again, I'm giving all these disclaimers because I'm uncomfortable publicly acknowledging
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.800]   that these are my current concerns.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.280]   It makes me seem very weird and I don't like that, but these are my concerns.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.140]   And so if you go to the bank early and you arrange distribution of physical currency,
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.160]   you can possibly get your hands on physical currency.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:16.240]   But if you wait until things are more difficult, then there's a good chance they don't.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.360]   And so what I have heard from many listeners is first of all, it's just flat out difficult
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.940]   to get your hands on physical currency in today's world.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.960]   There's been an incredible war on cash over the last number of years.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.560]   And although I've never done a standalone episode on that, I have all the material,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.120]   I've tested myself to see if that's actually true.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.840]   Because I used to think that was a conspiracy theory and oh, there's not a war on cash and
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.200]   I used to take it lightly.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.920]   At this point, I'm convinced that it's real, it's true and I've proved it for myself.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.860]   And then so it's hard under normal circumstances to get cash out of the bank.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.020]   And what I am hearing increasingly is that banks are just like you go through when you
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.500]   face an emergency, right?
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.140]   There are a number of different phases to it.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.880]   And you can see this with regard to the toilet paper crisis and whatnot right now.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.720]   So the first phase is that there's a reason for concern.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.880]   If you move before there's a reason for concern, you can stockpile as much of anything as you
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   want.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.740]   And so the secret is always to move before there's a reason for concern.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.220]   Six months ago, if you were stockpiling the necessary goods and you wanted to stockpile
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.840]   toilet paper, you could go to Costco, you could get two or three carts and you could
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.120]   get as much toilet paper as you wanted.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.860]   It was cheap, it was easy and nobody would look at you other than like I wonder why that
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.720]   guy's getting so much toilet paper but nobody would take a picture of you and post it online
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.260]   for public excoriation.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.140]   That was what you could do six months ago.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:53.740]   Now if you went back in December and January when we first started hearing news of a potential
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.460]   viral outbreak, it was early, we were seeing news, it had a whistleblower that started
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.580]   to bring it, people were paying attention.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.180]   If you understood the potential contagion of a global viral pandemic, you could go in
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.540]   January and you could buy toilet paper and you could get three carts worth and there
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.540]   was no big deal.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.380]   You didn't harm anybody else, everything was entirely fine, there was no downside to that
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.660]   whatsoever.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.300]   In February it started to get questionable but if you waited until March and then you
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.940]   went and did it, now as far as I'm concerned you're engaging in something that is hurting
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.500]   other people and this is like the difference between the word stockpiling versus hoarding.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:37.020]   I don't like the use of the word hoarding the way that it's usually used.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.740]   I don't like it at all because what happens is that I'm not a hoarder if I went six months
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.500]   ago and purchased a year's supply of toilet paper, I'm simply stockpiling.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.660]   No one else is hurt, there's plenty of slack in the supply line, that's just a simple choice,
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.180]   I'm stockpiling.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.660]   Now then they start using the word hoarding and they say well you're hoarding because
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.580]   now you're taking things and that's making it unavailable to other people and I believe
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:08.780]   that you're entirely justified in doing that but that that's not a good expression of love
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.780]   for your neighbor.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:17.260]   I don't want to take valuable resources in a difficult time away from people who need
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:24.540]   them more than I do and so I would not go, if I was going to make an order for masks
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:29.780]   six months ago, I could order a thousand masks and just simply have that available for me
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.860]   and I didn't hurt anybody.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.620]   In fact now I would be in a position to give charity because now I could take, if I bought
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.340]   a thousand masks, obviously I'm being a little bit hyperbolic with these numbers but if I
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.260]   bought a thousand masks now I could easily take three or four or five hundred of them
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.900]   and I could take them to my local hospital, I could take them and donate them and really
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:53.020]   be helpful and my stockpiling allowed me to be charitable during a time when that charity
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.780]   is really needed and so that's just good sense.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:02.340]   Now I don't believe that it's a good practice or an ethical moral practice to hoard during
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.300]   times of shortages, that's not love for neighbor.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:12.660]   And so this is not a time to go out and to hoard those resources but there's a major
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.260]   difference between stockpiling and hoarding.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.460]   So where are we financially?
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.100]   Why am I concerned about physical currency?
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.980]   Well if we continue on the current path then next week and the week after we're going to
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.820]   start to see public concern about banks.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.180]   We're going to start to see public concerns about a lot of stuff in the financial supply
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.780]   and this is the most complex supply chain in the world where you've got the biggest
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.780]   people involved.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:47.260]   You've got the supply chain of the Federal Reserve controlling the actual supply of money
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.660]   in the economy.
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:55.620]   You've got the big consumers of money, of individuals, of corporations, of governments,
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.820]   etc. and on a global basis this supply chain is now being tested.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.540]   And so what are the stages that people go through?
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:14.820]   Well in physical products like toilet paper normally what would happen is as demand rises
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.780]   then the price would rise and that price would start to adjust the supply.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.740]   But of course in the United States and in most countries around the world there are
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.700]   what are known as price gouging laws which are supposed to keep the prices from changing
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.340]   in a situation like that.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.860]   So instead of the price changing to reflect the increase in demand what happens is the
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.700]   stores sell the product out very quickly and then they start to have shortages.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.580]   Then in order to deal with those shortages in a way that doesn't alienate their customers
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.660]   which is the first thing that stores should not change prices massively because it alienates
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:56.180]   their customers and also in a way that follows the anti-price gouging laws they impose rationing
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.180]   and that's the next step.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.580]   So when you start to see rationing you're a little bit late but when you see rationing
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.300]   there's probably still time for you to go out and to get your supplies because the supply
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.980]   is starting to be filled in.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.360]   The warehouses are shipping out more toilet paper.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.020]   You can go to multiple different stores.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.400]   You can get a couple things.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.140]   Again we've got an ethical problem there that I think we should be cautious of.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.940]   There's no reason to cause unnecessary shortages but practically speaking if you need more
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.140]   toilet paper you can go and get it when you're in that period of rationing.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:31.500]   So that period of rationing is a very important sign that hey something's going on.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.580]   Now that period of rationing can be short term.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:39.020]   It can change and so you want to say why is this being rationed and what's actually going
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.020]   to happen.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.460]   So with cash what I am seeing is first of all cash has been a tightly controlled market
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.840]   for a long time.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.260]   It's a very tightly controlled market and there's a lot of rationing involved.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.100]   You cannot generally go on just about any day to your bank and ask for large amounts
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   of cash.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.340]   You have to put an order in and they have to need a day or two to satisfy it.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.780]   The amount of physical currency that's available is absolutely tiny compared to the amount
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.700]   of currency that's in circulation.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.620]   So now what you're seeing is you're seeing more and more stress and more and more strain
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.100]   go onto the banks and so banks are starting to ration their services.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.140]   I've received multiple reports from listeners who've shared with me directly that banks
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.560]   are limiting withdrawals to $3,000.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.940]   That's a frequent number that I've heard from multiple listeners that they're limited in
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.900]   cash withdrawals to $3,000.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.060]   That's not a lot of money.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:40.340]   That's really not a lot of money and so that's concerning because that's in addition to other
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:48.700]   rationing mechanisms such as just as you think about mechanisms like ATM distribution limits
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.220]   at $400 and $300, etc.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.940]   Now even if you go in and you have $10,000 in your account, the banks are limiting you.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.180]   In addition, banks are rationing access to their services.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.900]   Many banks are closing down their lobbies and they're leading to you have to do business
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.380]   with them in the drive-thru, which makes all the sense in the world given a viral outbreak.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.120]   Makes all the sense in the world, but I'm also concerned now about even just the access
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.180]   to money, physical money.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.760]   That rationing is a major warning sign to say what's going to happen in the future.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.860]   Now the supply chains are still pumping in money.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.780]   Every single night the banks are trying to refill their vaults.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.000]   The Federal Reserve is getting digital money out.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.820]   There's currency that's flowing around to try to meet the demand, but it's possible
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.700]   that that gets worse.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.980]   As the news continues to—as more and more people start to understand where we are and
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.220]   as more and more people start to understand the financial concern, as these things start
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:54.460]   to hit publicly, pit the public awareness, then it could affect it.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.220]   What happens is you're not dealing with—when you're dealing with markets, you're dealing
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.140]   with people and their individual behaviors.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.460]   The thing that causes the panic is not necessarily the actual results.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.780]   It's not necessarily the actual outcome.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.740]   This is why you've seen people arguing about, "Well, the coronavirus is just a flu."
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.460]   Well, in my mind it's rather obvious that it's not just a flu.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.940]   I don't understand how people can still believe that.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.820]   It was one thing to say that when you had data out of China that you couldn't be sure
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.100]   of, but at the moment I don't see how you say that.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.940]   But the problem is not that it's just a flu.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.180]   There is the medical problem, and then there's the perception of the medical problem.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.460]   There's the actual issue, and then there's the human psychology and the panic that ensues.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.620]   And so financially you have exactly the same thing.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.700]   So what are people who are managing the finances trying to do?
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.620]   They're trying to solve the actual problem, and then they're trying to manage perception
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.780]   because the danger is that there is mass panic.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:56.280]   And when there's mass panic, then all of a sudden everything gets out of whack.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.340]   And so there's the problem, which people can argue about the problem, but then there's
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.500]   the reaction to the problem, which is in and of itself a problem.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.780]   That's why people are always – medical advisors, even me, I'm trying to balance, okay?
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.100]   Let me speak into the subject, but also manage the human psychology.
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.940]   Now thankfully in my case I can speak without – I'm not a government agent.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.100]   I don't have responsibility to that.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.320]   I just have responsibility to my listeners to give them the best ideas that I have.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:27.780]   But at the moment, financially speaking, over the coming weeks we're in very, very tricky
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.900]   waters.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:34.180]   And what's going to happen is they're flooding the market with money, and that money is going
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.420]   to be digital money.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.660]   That money is going to be physical money.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:44.780]   But in a contagion of panic, that human psychology can lead to shortages, can lead to major problems.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.500]   And that's the kind of thing that can lead to bank collapse.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.340]   That's the kind of thing that can lead to freezes.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.920]   That's the kind of thing that can lead to all kinds of awful price control laws, currency
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.620]   control laws, all the stuff that just makes a financial panic awful.
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:07.100]   And so that is the fear that is being discussed right now in – that's the fear that's being
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.460]   discussed right now in every corner of the financial universe.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.460]   How do we avoid this?
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:19.340]   Now, I'm hopeful that it'll be able to be avoided, and so I don't want to be the cause of panic.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.660]   But I also don't want my family to be without toilet paper.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.140]   And so when you see something, I think you have to say something, and that's what I'm
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.140]   doing here.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.260]   So that's the background to that, is that as I watch this develop, this is the next
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.220]   – one of the next big potential events that is going to make things more and more difficult.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.020]   >>Steve: Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.660]   So based on – so you'd recommend I need to kind of step that cash out.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.300]   They're only going to give me so much anyway, so I kind of have to step it out.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.300]   >>Steve: Right, right.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.880]   >>Adam: Yeah, what I would do – thankfully, $3,000 is a very doable amount.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.140]   You can go to your bank, you can get a distribution, you can call them and ask them.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.520]   If you haven't, one of the things I always recommend and have for years is that you should
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.840]   always have high ATM limits on your cards.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.440]   This has become more difficult in recent years.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.820]   For example, with my bank for many years – and this is back to the war on cash – with my
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.160]   bank for many years, I was able to institute a standing order for all of my debit cards
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:26.320]   that I could – where my ATM – my daily ATM distribution limit was I think $5,500.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.360]   I had to do it in writing.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.560]   I would give them a written request, but I had on all of my debit cards $5,500 daily
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.520]   ATM distribution limits.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.560]   So I could go to an ATM and I could sit there and the ATM has a limit and then your bank
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.680]   has a limit for ATM distributions.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.480]   But I could go to the ATM, I could sit there and put in my PIN number – let's say it's
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.080]   $400 – I could put in my PIN number 13 times and get out $5,000 from the ATM without my
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   bank shutting me down.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:01.040]   Then with multiple accounts, I could do that with multiple cards and multiple accounts
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.320]   and then I could do that on multiple days.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.240]   And so I always had it set up so that if I needed – all of a sudden I look around and
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.600]   I need cash, whether it's to go and buy an RV because somebody's selling one or
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.960]   buy a boat or whether it's I need cash because I'm worried about getting access to cash.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.440]   I always had it set up so that I could go and I could just from an ATM at 10 o'clock
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.360]   at night, I could go and I could get $20,000 out because if I have multiple debit cards
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.120]   with high limits set on those, then I could go to multiple ATMs and I could go get $20,000
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   out of the bank.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.960]   Well, what happened is I think a year or two ago, I lost my debit card and I got a new
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.560]   debit card.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.400]   And then I tried one time to go get money out of the bank and I couldn't get a lot
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.780]   of money out of the bank and that was really frustrating.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.440]   And so I called them and I said, "What's going on?"
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.080]   I knew from previous experience when I had lost previous debit cards that whenever I
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.760]   got a new debit card, I had to reinstitute that same policy.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:06.720]   I had a written authorization with the bank but I had to call them and say, "Will you
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.080]   please go ahead and reference my written authorization that's on file and give me the permanent high
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.280]   ATM limit on this card?"
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.600]   So then what I found out with the new card is that they would no longer honor that and
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:23.680]   the bank had made a policy change that now I was limited to whatever the stupid $500
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:33.200]   or $600 standard thing but I could still contact them on occasion to request a higher ATM distribution
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.260]   limit.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.840]   And so that was just a sign and I said, "This is one of the most valuable things in the
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   world to me.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   What are you doing?"
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   And they just wouldn't listen to me.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.480]   And so I said, "Ah, this is getting worse and worse."
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.160]   Now every bank is different, right?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.200]   There's a big difference between the big monster mega banks and modest size banks and local
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.440]   credit unions, etc.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.560]   But I have watched, you know, year after year I've watched this get even harder.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.460]   And so I lost the question I was answering when I was responding to you.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.260]   But just, oh, the point was simply that $3,000, you should be able to get that out of the
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.720]   ATM.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   That's doable.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.340]   Go to a few ATMs, request a temporary ATM distribution limit if you do that or just
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.260]   go to the bank and see if they give you the cash.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.460]   You don't have a problem.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.100]   The person who has the problem is the guy who's got a couple hundred thousand dollars
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.380]   and he wants to say, "You know, I'd like to pull out $30,000 or $50,000 or $100,000
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.860]   and put it aside just in case."
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.800]   That's where things are starting to get tricky.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.320]   So I don't think we're right there, but that's going to be the next thing.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.280]   And so I'm watching that very carefully over the next couple of weeks and looking for information,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   but that's my advice.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:44.640]   >>Trevor: My wife and I have been, since right around October, we've been slowly prepping,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.440]   slowly getting fruit stores and things like that in the basement.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:53.120]   We've always been working on emergency funds and we've been debt free for our entire marriage
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   since 2012.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.280]   And we take all this very seriously.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:06.160]   And my wife, I'm taking your radical preparedness course and my wife, she thinks that's all
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   a good thing.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   But it's been kind of neat to see this kind of go on because I think it's almost, God's
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   timing is amazing.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.640]   It's almost prophetic that you're doing this right now, that you have been doing this because
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.560]   all of this has been theory in our household as we've discussed a lot of what you're talking
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.560]   about.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.880]   And now here we are.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.120]   I said, "I wish this happened six months later.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.560]   We'd have been so much more prepared for this."
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:38.880]   And so my wife actually just this morning, she just, in a stockpiling mentality, not
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.720]   a hoarding mentality, she just got back from the store and she got extra of everything
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.440]   so that we can not have to leave for a few weeks if we don't have to.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.000]   And she said, "I'm so glad you're taking that."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.360]   She's totally on board now.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.880]   And you go to the grocery store.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   It's a little bit eerie.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.680]   I was walking through Alpi and it's quiet, it's empty, the shelves are empty, and somebody's
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   cell phone started playing the Titanic.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   I said, "Oh no, what's happening here?"
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   Well, thank you for taking that course.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   And even, oh, I cut you off.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   Forgive me.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   Go ahead.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   No, I was just going to say I really appreciate the help.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:23.520]   And I just had just a follow-up thought of, if I do all this cash stuff, then I can, as
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.680]   long as my income continues, I can just continue my regular plan of saving for kids' futures,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.320]   saving to pay off mortgage and all that.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   I can stay the course.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   Exactly.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   Don't have to alter those goals.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   Okay?
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   Exactly.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.200]   Yeah, I think, and thank you for taking the course.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.360]   I'm glad that it is helpful.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.800]   I will tell you this, I am teaching that course, right?
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.000]   I have paid attention to this for a long time.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.240]   I have pages of notes of things that I feel exposed on because I can hardly believe every
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   day.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.480]   I get my normalcy bias every single day.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.800]   And I just say, I thought this through, but I always thought, I knew historically that
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.160]   a global flu pandemic, or global viral pandemic, this is the thing that throughout history
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.480]   has changed again and again and again, entire civilizations.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.520]   The plague changed history.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.720]   You can see cholera outbreaks, the Spanish flu, again and again and again, you can see
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.920]   that this changed civilizations.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.880]   Entire civilizations disappear because of infectious disease outbreaks.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:33.400]   You have smallpox outbreaks in the Americas and entire cultures and civilizations disappear.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:39.220]   And so I've always thought that this was a serious threat.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.720]   And because of the model of the threat, as I've stated publicly, I've always thought
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.800]   that this was the hardest thing because it's all the globe all at once.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.560]   And especially that's the risk that has always risen, that in the past, it wasn't always
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.280]   all the globe all at once because people traveled around at a fairly moderate speed, the rate
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.360]   of that their own feet would take them, the rate that a horse would take them, the rate
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.160]   that a sailboat would take them.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.320]   But now as the speed of travel has increased and we went from horses to trains and trains
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.380]   to automobiles and then to airplanes, and now people travel around at 24 hours a day,
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:20.420]   that has always been the major risk factor for the outbreak of infectious disease because
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:25.580]   that speed of movement makes it possible for something to go from one area to the rest
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.860]   of the world all at once.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.740]   Well, that's been compounded and had offsetting benefits to it.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.380]   The information also travels and so information travels fast, which leads to a bigger risk
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.660]   of panic, a bigger risk of the human psychology.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.260]   During the Spanish flu, very rarely people knew what they knew from their neighbors and
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.060]   they knew what they knew from the newspapers, but now I'm tuned into the world flow of information
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.220]   and so is everybody else.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:57.220]   And so this increases the risk of human reaction and overreaction, human panic, et cetera,
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.760]   and it makes it even more acute.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.660]   Now thankfully there are offsetting factors.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.500]   We have massively improved healthcare systems.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:09.880]   We have massively improved treatment systems, massively improved understanding of germs
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:16.180]   and viruses, et cetera, and so there are offsetting factors that make things better, but you see
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.180]   it playing out.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.180]   So the point is just simply to say, "Yes, I understand the situation you're in," and
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.660]   every day I look at it and I think, "Well, I always knew that this was a scenario, but
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:31.380]   I didn't know it was going to be quite this difficult."
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.380]   During your course.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:40.040]   Yeah, exactly, and so it's one of those things where I keep hoping every day that there'll
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.280]   be some cure, but I'm like, "Next time it comes, I'm going to be 10 times better prepared
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:49.880]   than I am now," because I don't like the impact of it day by day.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.920]   I don't like it and I'm in a better situation than most people.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   So all right, man.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   Guy, thanks for calling in.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   I'm going to boogie on.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.920]   I've got a bunch of other callers to work with, so thank you very much.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.600]   All right, we go now to, looks like Mohamed.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   Is that you?
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   Welcome to the show.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   How can I serve you today?
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   Hi, Josh.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600]   Thank you.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.960]   Yes, I've been to the Joshua Sheets University, so I've taken all your courses and I so appreciate
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   everything you've done.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.040]   I'm in a situation where I'm doing telemedicine, so I have my online business right now doing
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.840]   telemedicine as a physician.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.440]   I have a few other online businesses, so I'm in a good financial situation as far as income.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.680]   I have a good amount of cash saved up.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:33.320]   I also have real estate in the US and I have a piece of property in Spain, so I could live
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   in either one.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.400]   Currently, I'm in California working in a clinic and I'm debating in the long run, but
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.680]   also in the short term, is it better for me to be in Spain or is it better for me to be
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   here?
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.360]   I can do my business in either place.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.920]   And a follow-up question, if you do have time, if not, that's fine, is whether there's an
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.560]   opportunity right now to invest in anything that comes to your mind.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   Thank you.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.800]   Before I answer those, could you give any comments with your experience and what you're
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.360]   seeing on the ground of things that you think I've gotten wrong or things that I've gotten
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.000]   right in terms of just for my audience?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.280]   Because, of course, we always appreciate when we can hear directly from somebody who's part
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   of the community who has the medical knowledge.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.560]   Can you give any comment on what you're seeing and where you think we go from here?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:26.520]   Yeah, I mean, it would always be more comfortable speaking to you directly without your audience,
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.360]   but, I mean, I'm happy to say what I've experienced.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:34.160]   So I'm a family medicine physician, so I'm in a community health center working in Compton,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   Los Angeles.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.560]   So we have a little bit of a lower education status with patients and a little bit less
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   access.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   So we are seeing a lot of people who are coming in with cold and flu symptoms because they're
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   certainly afraid.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.760]   They've been turned away at the ERs or they're trying to go to the hospitals.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.200]   We don't have any testing.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.680]   And even if we did have testing, we can't rely on the results of the tests right now.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.480]   We don't know what the specificity and sensitivity is.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.200]   We don't have enough personal protective equipment to collect those specimens, which can put
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.180]   us physicians at risk.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:13.240]   We also have a lot of fear as far as me as a physician.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.280]   Everybody said that there is this waiver, there's that law waiver, we can do telemedicine,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   we can do this.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.760]   Everybody said that me as a physician, I'm off the hook for a lawsuit.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   So unfortunately, that hasn't come down the pipeline yet.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.640]   So a lot of us physicians are afraid to diagnose a certain potential disease like this.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:35.480]   If we see somebody with certain symptoms, I'm not saying that people do this, but I'm
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.640]   saying that physicians have, you know, we're careful about how we document it in the chart,
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.320]   because if I do miss a heart attack versus a pneumonia versus a COVID infection, then
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   I'm on the hook.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.680]   And if I do send the patient over to the ER, I'm on the hook.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.640]   I get chewed out by the ER doctor, I get chewed out by the hospital, I get chewed out by the
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:00.280]   CEO, the CFO has given us talks at the clinic, the medical director has given us talks.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.840]   So there's a lot of chaos and we're not getting enough information as physicians to know what
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   to do, how to manage these patients, how to screen the patient, and what can I say to
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   a patient?
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   Should I keep him at home?
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.000]   Should I send him to the hospital?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.880]   So there's a lot of chaos for us.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.800]   We're protecting ourselves, we're protecting our ass, because I'm trying to protect my
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   income.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.360]   So that's what's happening there.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360]   But yeah.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   I think that's enough.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.460]   I've got private messages from other physicians that I can share anonymously as well.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.460]   So thank you.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:37.000]   To answer your questions, I would say specifically Spain versus California.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.160]   It seems to me that between the two, I'd probably rather be in California right now, especially
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:50.320]   for your opportunities to generate income off of this.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.840]   I think that if you're going to work hard during this period, as you certainly are,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.680]   that there's no reason for you not to get paid.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.280]   And so there's probably a better opportunity for you to be able to generate income in the
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:07.600]   private market in the United States and through the telemedicine options versus the nationalized
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.840]   systems in Spain.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.440]   Now if that's wrong based upon your experience, then just discount that.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.480]   But to me that seems like an option.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.640]   You can use your geographic flexibility to go where you can help people and be well compensated
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.920]   for that work.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.560]   That would be helpful.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:31.840]   In addition, it seems to me that if you are a US citizen, you are going to have a little
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.440]   bit more security there than you are in Spain, being perhaps a resident.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.520]   But are you a citizen, an EU citizen or a Spanish citizen?
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.320]   I'm a permanent resident of Spain, so I have a visa and I'm a citizen of the US.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.320]   Okay, so that's good.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.600]   So anyway, that's one consideration.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.560]   Beyond that though, I would look at just on the ground and say where do you feel more
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.840]   comfortable and where do you feel like you can serve more effectively.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.440]   It might be possible if you're going to work at a clinic in Spain and also do telemedicine,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.640]   perhaps that would be the most effective place for you to serve.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.880]   I know you're not at this time just trying to figure out what's all in it for you, you're
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.220]   seeking to serve.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.800]   But I would look at the medical options and see.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.720]   You're probably, hopefully it's okay in either place.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.000]   I don't know that, you know, the United States is probably a week or so behind Europe in
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.840]   terms of the proliferation of the infection, or at least the acknowledgement of the proliferation
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.840]   of the infection.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.800]   And where we go from here, I don't know.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.840]   I'd be slow to get on an airplane right now, so the fact that you're in California right
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.360]   now to me would be pretty persuasive.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.960]   I don't have any more insight than that.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.560]   You could probably be useful in both places and may you know God's wisdom and strength
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.520]   as you seek to serve in this time.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.020]   As far as investment options, I see that as a question of now versus later.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.820]   And these are very, very different scenarios.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:59.960]   At the moment, answering investment options is hard because we don't know the extent of
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.880]   the, we don't know the extent of anything.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.640]   We're still in the situation of just simply not having good, reliable information and
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:14.000]   thus good data analysis is very, very difficult because there's so many unknowns.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:26.800]   Now I think we can be certain that regardless of what happens with the infection, with the
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:35.040]   virus, with the actual pandemic, it has already caused incalculable economic damage.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:41.880]   At this point in time, I am mentally preparing myself for that economic damage to continue
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.440]   for minimum months and months and probably more like a year to 18 months.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:54.680]   As best I can understand, it seems to me that there are two basic things that can solve
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:03.940]   the, that can potentially solve the medical problem and only one of them is short term.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:09.280]   The first thing that will dramatically change the medical problem is the discovery of a
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.700]   very effective treatment protocol for people with coronavirus, with COVID.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.560]   And so I see people talking about that.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.920]   I see physicians trying things.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.440]   Again, all the excitement in the last few days over chloroquine, I hope I'm saying that
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.080]   right, but there's excitement over it.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.680]   But I haven't seen lots of people say, "Yes, let's trumpet this.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.080]   We've got this thing licked."
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:42.540]   If some kind of extremely effective therapeutic treatment is found that's effective for young
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.720]   people and old people alike, that could bring this whole thing, that could bring the infection
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.500]   to a stop and that treatment could be preventive.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.720]   It could be a way of inoculating people against the impacts of the infection.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.080]   And then there are enough people I think who would be happy if they knew there were a treatment
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.600]   and say, "Okay, fine, I'll just go ahead and I'll get sick, I'll get infected and they've
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.000]   got a good treatment for me and we'll get herd immunity quickly in that situation."
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.400]   And so that's the best short term case for stopping the actual infection.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:21.680]   Now the best long term case is a vaccine, but I don't see how a vaccine could be developed
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:30.440]   and or developed, tested properly, created and distributed in anything less than a year
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.660]   and probably that's even too optimistic.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.520]   Something more like 18 months would be a time frame.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:41.480]   There are companies who right now are trialing vaccines, but there's such a huge difference
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.840]   between here versus there that to me it just seems like only someone who's ignorant of
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.160]   that process would think that that's a short term solution.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.440]   And so I'm looking for those two things, but the vaccine is long term.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.280]   Now unless a treatment is found, what we know right now is that this is a deadly disease
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.120]   that's incredibly infectious and is killing many.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:09.520]   And the modeling indicates that if this disease is not contained, then the death toll, what
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.200]   was it from the Olympia College this last week, you know, the estimated death toll in
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.040]   their modeling was something like four point, you know, over four million Americans, something
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.520]   like 45 million people globally in the worst case scenario.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.280]   Then they modeled different scenarios.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.420]   Now those things have of course have a huge margin of error.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.520]   We don't know that for sure, but the only thing we know for sure absolutely works is
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.600]   quarantine, is social distancing.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.720]   We know that if you sit in your house and you don't go anywhere and you're not sick
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.640]   now and you don't contact any sick people, you're not going to get sick.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:50.160]   And so quarantining and/or like vaccination and/or treatment is the only solution, but
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.340]   that comes with an incalculable economic cost.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:58.040]   And so at this point, I'm hoping that there's a therapy developed that's very effective
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.520]   within the next weeks and months.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.440]   And of course there are millions of doctors all around the world trying to find that,
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:11.160]   but until that's found, I don't see how this doesn't continue for a minimum of a year to
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.600]   18 months.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.640]   Maybe they'll figure out how to do rolling lockdowns to say, "Okay, we're going to lock
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.000]   down for three weeks.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.880]   That minimizes the spread of infection.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   Then we're going to go back to business as normal for a few weeks and then we're going
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.160]   to lock down again."
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:34.820]   But the cost of human lives is simply of an uncontrolled viral outbreak is simply too
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.360]   high for I think any politician to say, "Yes, we're going to do that," and for any intelligent
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.460]   rational person to be willing to engage with.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:48.360]   And so at the moment, I see this economic effect as getting deeper and longer and being
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:54.280]   on a period of again minimum months and months and months and months while hoping that a
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.680]   treatment is developed.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.640]   So if that analysis is right, if it's wrong, tell me why it's wrong, but if that analysis
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:07.160]   is right, I don't see a short-term investment opportunity that makes any sense.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.600]   And you can kind of go through almost all of the different asset classes, and by the
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:17.180]   way, except possibly the short-term solution would be cash, but that's not an investment,
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:25.340]   or possibly gold because of the perceived stability of gold in terms of crisis.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:32.380]   But if we look at investment opportunities, I think generally we look at business.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.920]   I always talk about it in terms of business.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.800]   I look at it in terms of real property, usually real estate and/or other tangible property,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.300]   and then paper assets.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.300]   Well paper assets are in turmoil.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.740]   Stocks are obviously in turmoil for good reason, and I don't see any reason to expect that
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.700]   to end any time soon.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:53.520]   The market is going to continue to react to massive inflows of money.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.820]   The market's going to continue to react to bad news, good news, etc.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:02.020]   But if you conceive of what a global lockdown, what you're seeing all around the world, a
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.360]   global lockdown is right now, and especially the potential cost as this virus continues
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:13.500]   to spread in areas where there's, you know, the testing in the United States is awful,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.380]   but what about the testing in Nigeria, right?
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.640]   What about the testing in the Congo?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.020]   What about the testing in greater India?
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.820]   Some of these, of course, Nigeria and India being very populated, the Congo not, but I
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:29.100]   mean the testing in these areas, it's just, it's incalculable, the cost here.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.940]   And if you look at the best-case scenario in the United States being catastrophic, the
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:40.700]   best-case scenario in Nigeria or the best-case scenario in Darfur or the best-case scenario
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.440]   in Mombasa is just awful.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.140]   It's worse than catastrophic.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.860]   So man, that's it.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.140]   How encouraging Joshua is today.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.140]   So paper assets on a global basis, where's the obvious play, right?
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.080]   Maybe there's a trade involved that you could do.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.780]   Maybe there's a trade in healthcare or something like that, and that's possible.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.660]   But in terms of generally speaking, I expect massive continuing levels of volatility as
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:14.020]   the market generally continues to come to terms with where we are and where we're going
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   from here.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.120]   I don't see how it gets better in the short term.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:25.080]   So I don't see an obvious paper play that I'm willing to say or I'm willing to advise
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   on.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.240]   What about real property?
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.100]   So the obvious solution here, well, let's go to business first.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.800]   So business is incredibly uncertain because with the exception of a business that you
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.780]   can create, right, I think that if you had the opportunity to say, "I'm going to build
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.380]   a telemedicine business," or, "I'm going to build something in the private market maybe
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.240]   with unlicensed people who aren't physicians and figure out something there," there are
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.160]   opportunities in business that can serve this need.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.220]   But for most businesses, most businesses right now are just utterly paralyzed because it's
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:01.120]   almost impossible for the vast majority of businesses to function in this environment.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.560]   There are a few that can function but most cannot.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.180]   And so the business thing is highly specific.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.300]   So what about property?
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:14.280]   Real property as in real estate, land, and/or physical property?
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.440]   Well, I think the power is of course with some kinds of tangibles.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.100]   If you were sitting on a mountain of – we can't use masks because of course you donate
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   all those.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.580]   But if you were sitting on something that were in high demand right now with the exception
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.260]   of the laws against it, you could make money off of it.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.940]   There was that story of the guy with 17,000 hand sanitizer bottles.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.540]   He could just go out and – well, when traffic was flowing, he could go stand in the road
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.580]   like they do outside of the United States and sell them one off to people on the road.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:48.020]   But there aren't real obvious plays there, especially there aren't real obvious plays
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.340]   that are not taken.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.380]   Ammunitions sold out, ammunition sold out.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:57.100]   So the only obvious play with any kind of real property would be something like gold
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.860]   and/or silver.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:02.660]   And I think that there's an interesting argument there.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.780]   I'm buying more gold.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:11.180]   I think that that's probably something that could work out.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:17.700]   The gold market has not – the price of gold has not gone through the roof based upon current
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.100]   events which is really interesting.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.300]   But of course, most people don't own gold.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.420]   There are arguments against it.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:29.540]   The single thing that I never expected, the thing that has been the most shocking to me
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.780]   and I'm using those words accurately and carefully.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.780]   That's not hyperbole.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:41.420]   But I have been legitimately shocked is I have never, ever imagined a scenario in which
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:47.980]   you would see governments doing things like in California where you are forbidding evictions.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.780]   I never would have imagined that and I thought I'd imagine some bad things and that was
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.740]   past my imagination.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.300]   And I don't know anything of what to do with that.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:01.740]   But generally I would have said if this were a week ago before those laws started getting
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:06.260]   passed, a week ago I would have said, "Well, the obvious play here is going to be buying
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.260]   real estate."
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:12.220]   And so my plan has been for years to stockpile cash, wait for recession.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.420]   I've seen it as inevitable that recession comes.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.660]   I would stockpile cash, wait for recession and then on the backside of recession when
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.980]   people start losing their houses, you start having increases in foreclosure, then I would
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.300]   go ahead and I would start buying real estate and I would establish a large and broad rental
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.300]   real estate portfolio.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:32.140]   That's been my plan since 2015.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.580]   I thought it would happen sooner.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.820]   I didn't expect it to take till 2020 but that's been my plan since 2015.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.580]   I was wrong on the timing.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:45.820]   But now with some of these changes in legislation, now I don't even know what to do with that
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:51.780]   because the entire real estate market is being turned upside down where if landlords can't
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:58.700]   evict tenants, then why would any tenant in their rational mind pay their rent?
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:05.660]   And if lenders can't foreclose on properties, then why does any borrower pay their mortgage?
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.500]   And so right now I don't know what to do with that.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.900]   I've looked at it, I've thought about it and as far as I know, that's unprecedented.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.860]   Maybe I just have – I have been so busy, I haven't had the time to go and try to do
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.900]   some research and see if there's something I didn't know about that, that maybe it's
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.980]   happened before and I just didn't know about it.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:26.780]   But I consider that unprecedented, absolutely unprecedented and I have no idea what to do
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.620]   with that from an investment perspective.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.660]   I've been on the phone with clients who are large real estate, own large amounts of real
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.260]   estate and we're just trying to figure out, "Okay, what do you do in this?"
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.820]   My answer is I don't know.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:44.560]   And so the only thing that I see that's safe is to revert back to income, generating an
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.740]   income and trying to figure out how to serve people in a way that generates income.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:58.100]   Cash, US dollar has strengthened over the last week, but cash, I go back to foreign
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.900]   currency diversification because I think the US dollar is the strongest currency in the
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.060]   world, probably will remain that way, but I'm nervous about having everything in US
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.820]   dollars and then we go back to precious metals.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:14.820]   And so that's what I'm doing and at the moment it's not, the way forward is not clear to
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.500]   me because of these unknowns.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:25.020]   I don't see the path because the path absent a treatment, absent an effective treatment
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:30.060]   protocol is utterly depressing.
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:38.140]   With an effective treatment protocol, then perhaps we could get to some kind of solution,
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.820]   but how do I predict what that effective treatment protocol is?
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.060]   And so there what I would say is what you should do as an investor is you should rely
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:54.300]   on your deeper level of biology and how to read kind of the medical literature and then
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:52:01.220]   as you see solutions or non-solutions, then think about the impact of those and then try
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.180]   to trade based on your inside knowledge.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.980]   That would be my best advice at this point in time.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.380]   >>Joshua Foer: Thank you, Josh.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.300]   >>Joshua Cohen: My pleasure.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   Thank you for the work that you're doing.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.580]   I appreciate your service.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:17.100]   All right, we go to Indiana.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.100]   Welcome to the show.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.100]   >>Indiana Jones: Hi, Joshua.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.100]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:26.340]   This is not the question that I called about, but when you were discussing getting cash
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:33.100]   earlier, I thought you gave a good explanation of why it might become hard to get cash in
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:40.100]   the near future, but you didn't really say why you think that having thousands or tens
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:45.420]   of thousands of dollars of currency on hand would be especially valuable in this time
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.420]   period.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.380]   >>Joshua Cohen: I'm concerned about banks being closed down.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.580]   I'm concerned about bank holidays.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.620]   I'm concerned about runs on the bank.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:53:00.900]   Every single time that there is economic panic and financial panic, what happens is there
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.360]   starts to be a run on the bank.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.300]   People start to go to the bank and get physical currency.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:10.180]   Now, in today's world, it's hard to imagine because all of us are used to doing work digitally.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.100]   It's a little hard to imagine it compared to the past.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:21.260]   The world of 2020, where the vast majority of us function on digital currency, it's hard
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:29.660]   to imagine, compared to 1950 when digital currency didn't exist.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:35.100]   But I still think that people are accustomed to this idea that in a bad scenario, cash
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:40.940]   is what is needed and physical currency is what they mean.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:46.180]   It would not surprise me to wake up on Sunday morning or Monday morning or Tuesday morning
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:50.700]   and see lines of people lined up at ATMs if this continues at the current pace.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.780]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.900]   Maybe I'm three weeks wrong.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.980]   It wouldn't surprise me to see that on Monday, and it wouldn't surprise me not to see that
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.980]   on Monday.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.620]   It wouldn't surprise me not to see that a month from now.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:05.460]   But if that starts to happen, that creates a general contagion and a general panic.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.700]   What do government bureaucrats do?
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:13.260]   What do they do in that situation?
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.460]   The answer is they close down the banks.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.300]   They shut down the banks.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.220]   They do that because they have to stop the flow of money and they have to stop the panic.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:24.580]   They understand that it's going to be the panic, and so they declare a bank holiday.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:29.160]   Now that bank holiday can vary depending on what country you're in and depending on how
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.980]   severe the crisis is.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.060]   But the bank holiday is declared and the government says, "Listen, you have FDIC insurance.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.700]   There's no need for you to panic.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.300]   You're insured at $250,000 per account.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.500]   We promise that these banks are going to be fine."
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:48.340]   The bankers all say, "We promise that you're going to be completely fine," but they stop
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:53.880]   the ability of people to get access to money, get access to physical currency.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.880]   So does that work?
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:59.380]   Well, a lot of people believe that it does, and there's arguments in favor of it doing
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.380]   it.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.300]   But it certainly is not comforting when all of a sudden you see a bank holiday in your
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.300]   state.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:09.580]   In fact, more people, more and more want to go and get cash.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:16.380]   And so what else does the government do in times of panic?
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:21.860]   Well, they start to bring in price controls, which just make everything worse.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:27.060]   Anti-price gouging laws are a form of price controls, and so they bring in price controls,
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:32.620]   and that makes everything harder.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.180]   Sometimes they make currency transactions illegal, whether it's certain currencies or
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.260]   certain larger amounts of currency.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:42.920]   And I think that the generalized population has become relatively immune to this at this
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.920]   point in time.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.780]   Americans, for example, have put up with and have not cried out about all the currency
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.780]   controls that have been in place for decades now.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:57.020]   Americans have not been concerned about the fact that you can't do transactions bigger
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:03.780]   than $10,000 in physical currency without a currency transaction report.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:09.380]   In Europe, many parts of Europe, it's illegal to do large transactions of currency.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:13.100]   You can't go and do something simple like buy a car from a guy with money.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:19.620]   Thankfully, it's not illegal yet in the United States, but it is certainly illegal in several
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:23.900]   parts of Europe.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.320]   In other countries, they've banned currency.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.100]   And so the question always comes down to navigating this, and it becomes brutal because it changes
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.300]   day by day.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:37.220]   In China, they have taken, in the wake of the virus, they took all the currency in and
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:40.740]   said they were going to reissue it, but they've moved everyone to a digital payment system.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.060]   India, what was the thing?
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.340]   Let me get my facts straight here.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:49.420]   Just off the top of my head, India last year canceled currency transactions, et cetera.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.500]   So the point is that I think that there's still, with the US dollar being strong, I
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:57:00.420]   think that the vast majority of people generally believe that the US dollar is going to be
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:04.460]   fine and that the vast majority of people still are happy to have cash.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.700]   And especially in a system of government money where you say, "Hey, I'll sell you this thing
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:12.300]   here for cash and it doesn't show up so I can still get my free money from the government
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.380]   or I can avoid this tax," et cetera, I think that when you have cash, you have the ability
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:18.860]   to move in the middle of a bank close down.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.980]   So if there's a bank holiday or if there's issues on digital money or you're required
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:29.600]   to track everything, et cetera, then I think currency still gives you value.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:33.560]   And so when you have currency, you have the ability to provide the needs of your family.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:40.420]   You can go to your neighbor who went to Costco a few weeks ago and bought 10 cases of toilet
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.940]   paper and say, "Listen, man, would you sell me a case of toilet paper and I'm happy to
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.140]   pay you triple what you paid for it?"
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.140]   And the neighbor says, "Yeah, sure.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.700]   I'll do that."
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.680]   You can buy services that you need.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.900]   You can purchase, have people do things for you with currency.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:01.100]   And so it's just the most useful tool in your toolbox and it's one of the few things that
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:09.220]   you can do in a scenario where there's uncertainty.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.420]   You can often go and use currency to get access to things that are simply not available.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.660]   So I've said for years, "Why have I talked about stockpiling?
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.980]   Why have I talked about preparedness?"
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:24.700]   Well, what I've said for years is money is always your most effective tool.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:30.340]   It's always your number one tool except in the situations where money doesn't work.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.500]   So why do we save money first?
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:39.180]   Well, because saving money is your best solution to problems in your life except when money
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.180]   doesn't work.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.740]   And so what did you see happen in the toilet paper market as just a best example?
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.620]   Money stopped working.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.180]   You couldn't get toilet paper really at any price.
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:49.920]   Now that's not actually true.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.700]   You could have gotten it at some price but you couldn't get it in the store because money
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.760]   stopped working for toilet paper and because the supply went out.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.780]   And so what's the next big thing that happens in a bad scenario?
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.700]   Again, I know this sounds nuts and I feel like a crazy man doing it but this is what
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.700]   you see throughout history which is why you've got to be prepared in advance.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:21.660]   Well, money still works in a situation where—so money is your best tool to buy stuff as long
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.660]   as money works.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.660]   We've talked about that.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   We've talked about stockpiling.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:29.140]   That's why we started talking in January about stockpiling, about preparedness, etc.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.060]   So now there are shortages.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.780]   There are shortages and there are probably going to be increased shortages, increased
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.920]   rationing.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.700]   Money is still your best tool to be able to surpass those shortages.
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:43.460]   If you don't have toilet paper but you know your neighbor has a bunch of toilet paper
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.180]   then you can just simply go to your neighbor and you can say, "Listen, neighbor, could
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.180]   I buy toilet paper?"
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.820]   And you can pay a high price.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:53.460]   But you can only do that if you have physical currency.
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.860]   Some people accept digital currency and you've got Venmo, you've got PayPal, you've got ways
[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:02.860]   to convey money but physical cash is still far more powerful.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:10.140]   So physical cash gives you the opportunity to get the stuff that your family needs in
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.820]   a difficult situation.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.540]   So that's the phase we're at now.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:18.340]   Now what's the next kind of final phase if you wind up with a really bad economic crisis?
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:25.140]   Well, in a really bad economic crisis you wind up with some combination of deflation
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.540]   and/or mass inflation and/or hyperinflation.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.460]   And so there are people who argue about these things.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:37.820]   Now, hear me clearly, at the moment I do not think that that is going to happen in the
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.820]   United States.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:42.860]   I do think that'll probably happen in some other countries in the world but I do not
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.900]   think that that's going to happen in the United States yet.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:51.360]   But I think that it is increasingly possible and I'm concerned about it because I see no
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.260]   end in sight for the reasons previously stated medically.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:01:01.700]   And so the biggest problem I have is not rational analysis of, "Hey, this could happen."
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.540]   The biggest problem I have is simply my own inability to believe that I'm even saying
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.540]   that out loud.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:13.660]   And that's a normalcy bias which is a flaw, it's a logical error, it's a logical fallacy.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.300]   And so I can't make my analysis based upon logical fallacies.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.340]   So let's talk about what happens if you go into a deflationary environment or a hyperinflationary
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.800]   environment.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.020]   Mass inflation is the least objectionable of those and probably the most likely.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.540]   But in a deflationary environment, you want to have money so that you can buy stuff.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:36.300]   And in a hyperinflationary environment, you want to have money so you can buy stuff.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.580]   And so if all of a sudden you got into one of those situations where you had to very
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.120]   quickly make large purchases, you want to have the ability to do that with actual money
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.100]   that you can access, not money where they say it's transaction decline.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.600]   That's the value of cash.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.620]   And so whether that's just simply to buy food, if there are food shortages, whether that's
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:02.060]   simply by having cash so that when capital controls or price controls or more rationing
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:07.100]   or anti-hoarding laws or just any other kind of financial control or financial repression
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:12.700]   laws enacted, then you have the ability to work around that system.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:18.220]   If I've got $30,000 in my pocket, I can get on an airplane, I can go to another country
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.860]   and I can turn that $30,000 into local currency and I can start again.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.080]   And so that's the argument for cash.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.500]   It's the thing that solves problems when everybody else is locked down, when everybody else's
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:35.920]   accounts are frozen, when everybody else has their credit cards are frozen, and we're in
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:46.220]   such a crazy scenario that it's increasingly possible to see those things happening.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.080]   And so I still think there's time.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.640]   I still think there's plenty of time.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:56.000]   I still hope that that's premature, but this is the time to be prepared for that next step.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.160]   And so what's the cost of having cash?
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.800]   Well, the cost of having cash is foregone interest, right?
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.840]   You're not getting interest on cash anyway.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:08.840]   And so the only costs of having cash that I see is number one, you have a security risk,
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:15.920]   risk of theft, risk of loss, risk of fire, but you can mitigate those risks pretty well
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.680]   and you have a convenience risk that you're not going to go up in today's world in the
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.680]   United States.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.440]   You're not going to go and buy, generally speaking, you're not going to go and buy a
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.520]   house for $100,000 of cash.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.320]   I guess it's in theory possible, but it's not going to happen.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.600]   So in that situation, if all of a sudden we say, "Yeah, it's time to go ahead and invest
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.040]   in real estate and I want to qualify for a mortgage in a kind of a more normal world
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.920]   where we're trying to take advantage of normal level recessions," then you need that money
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   in the bank.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.600]   So you can prove its provenance.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.260]   You can prove its legal creation.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.960]   You have the bank trail of it.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.800]   So that's where you need the money in the bank.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.520]   And so if I, you know, I'm not taking all my money out of the bank and going in cash,
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.340]   but I am concerned about not having significant amounts of cash and I'm concerned about not
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.440]   having foreign currencies, et cetera.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.440]   So did that make sense?
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.440]   Was that a good explanation or did I totally muddy the water?
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.720]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   I don't disagree.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.760]   I actually, I'm in my car and I literally just went to the bank and took some extra
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.160]   cash out because I was listening to you.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:23.000]   I guess it seems to me like I'm in probably a similar situation to the caller you were
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.200]   talking to earlier about that.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.480]   And you know, I don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside where, you know, I can
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:34.640]   put $30,000 in cash and that's, and I understand it's not a big deal to have all my money in
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:42.160]   cash for a short period of time, but you know, I have some stockpiles of food and toilet
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.640]   paper and stuff like that.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.840]   You're a rich man.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840]   Everything crashes.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   Yes.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.840]   If everything crashes and people aren't paying their mortgages and the banks are shut down
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.440]   and I'm not allowed to use my debit card or my credit card to pay my electric bill, you
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.920]   know, a few thousand dollars would supply my family with food and toilet paper and such
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.440]   like beyond what we need for quite a long time.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.280]   So I guess I'm not really disagreeing with anything you said.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.520]   I just, it seems like as a listener, I can start to feel a little bit panicked listening
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.600]   to you.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.160]   And for those of us in the middle, middle area where we're not going to say, oh yes,
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.240]   I have lots of cash stockpiles and hey, here's a great deal on a $40,000 RV.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.200]   If I can hand over a hundred dollar bills and that's, you know, no big deal to me to
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200]   do that.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:35.280]   I mean, I could manage, but we could have $20,000 in cash sitting at home.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.680]   I just want to encourage you to maybe say like, is there some reason that a person who
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:47.160]   has the net worth of 40 or $50,000 liquid assets, I don't think we should be feeling
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.440]   panicked and racing out to try to get all of that hundred dollar bills.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.960]   I wanted to give you the chance to clarify that.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:06:00.760]   It's a fair point and it's very difficult to me knowing that my words are listened to
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.240]   by other people.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:08.160]   I don't wish to be the person who spreads panic.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.640]   There is a time to panic.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.280]   The best time to panic is before it's needed so that you're prepared for it.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.920]   And so, you know, let's say that you are using a chainsaw and your chainsaw slips and cuts
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.240]   your thigh open and you're looking down at your thigh gushing blood and you know your
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.640]   femoral artery is right there.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.440]   You're going to die in a few minutes unless a solution is found.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:45.120]   And so that is the time not to, you know, obviously this word panic because panic is
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.280]   truly counterproductive where your heart starts racing, your mind shuts down, your body is
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.640]   flooded with adrenaline.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.760]   Panic is never a good idea.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.960]   So I don't know the word to use to say this is serious and you have exactly 60 seconds
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.780]   to stop the problem.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.600]   So in that situation, what do you do?
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:11.320]   The only hope of your living in that situation is that a tourniquet is applied to your thigh
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:18.680]   in seconds, in tens of seconds, and a tourniquet is applied to your thigh in tens of seconds
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.920]   and that you have qualified medical professionals there in as absolutely fast as they can be
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.320]   there, 60 seconds would be great.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:32.480]   So when you look at a situation like that, you look down and you see how serious this
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.720]   is.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.760]   You would be an idiot who should panic if you went out to use a chainsaw wearing a pair
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.680]   of board shorts and flip-flops without a tourniquet, right?
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.680]   You're stupid.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.580]   You're absolutely stupid to do that.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.880]   So if you're going to use a chainsaw, you think ahead and you say, number one, I'm going
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.400]   to make sure that I wear proper safety equipment.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.960]   I'm going to wear chainsaw chaps to protect me in case my chainsaw slips.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.840]   I'm going to wear steel-toed chainsaw boots.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.680]   I'm going to be prepared with proper protective equipment.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.240]   Well, people don't do that because it costs, people don't do that because it costs, you
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   know, hundreds of dollars to go and buy the stuff, but you're an idiot if you don't do
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   that.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.000]   Number two, you make sure that you have a tourniquet on your person ready to go so that
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.040]   you can quickly reach down and if you have an accident, you can put a tourniquet on your
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.000]   leg and you learn how to use it.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   And so the time to panic is before you ever turn on the chainsaw.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.800]   Now that panic is just simply preparation.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.220]   And so I don't know how to properly with my own voice other than explain the difference
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.220]   between these things.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.800]   I'm not panicked.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.040]   I'm not panicking.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.960]   I am, I'm rested.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   I'm relaxed.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.160]   I'm trying to think rationally and clearly, but I'm trying to observe the situations at
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:51.920]   hand, study the dangers, make appropriate preparations to care for my family and make
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.980]   appropriate preparations to help my listeners who've put their confidence in me without
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.720]   saying do something stupid.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:04.080]   So that's the only way I know how to do it is to explain here's the situation and here's
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.160]   the solution.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.800]   The solution to chainsaw safety is number one, hire somebody else to do it and let them
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.540]   be the ones to die for it.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:17.760]   Number two, the solution is wear proper protective equipment, use proper techniques for safety
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.920]   and then number three to have a tourniquet.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.420]   But if you look down and you don't have that stuff in place, then somebody should say this
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.300]   is unwise, this is foolish.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.400]   So I don't know if that muddies the water, but basically here's the reality we're in.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:39.440]   Okay, the risk of a viral pandemic has always been there.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.560]   It's always been there throughout history.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.400]   Viral infectious pandemic has changed the course of history time and time again as previously
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.000]   discussed with previous examples.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.160]   It is a massive risk.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:59.320]   When we start to go into one, what you're hoping for is you're hoping to see competent
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.360]   reaction to that viral pandemic.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.180]   That's why there is a World Health Organization.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:11.520]   That's why every country has some kind of Centers for Disease Control and why every
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.460]   country and many cities hire infectious disease specialists and why there are teams of people.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.760]   That's why hospitals stockpile personal protective equipment.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.040]   That's why they're prepared for that and you hope for competence in those situations.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.680]   And with competence, what you can see is that any viral infectious disease outbreak can
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.560]   be properly managed.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.380]   You can see that in Singapore right now.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.260]   You can see that in South Korea.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:42.400]   You can see that there have been competent reactions and responses to this viral outbreak.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.040]   And so you can even see it in China.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.000]   It was incompetent at first, but at the moment it seems like they have competently responded.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.160]   Now all of us have the opportunity to respond competently to that risk.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.920]   The United States government has the opportunity to respond competently to that risk.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.940]   The Panamanian government has the responsibility.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:06.680]   Every government in the world has the opportunity to respond competently.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.580]   Sometimes competent response happens and sometimes competent response doesn't happen.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:17.480]   Now let's go over to financial risks, market risks, fiscal risks, monetary risks.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.080]   Every government in the world has the ability to manage its finances competently with regard
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.780]   to its fiscal situations.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.040]   There's no requirement that a government borrow money.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.120]   There's no requirement that government builds massive welfare states destined to support
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.480]   millions of people.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.360]   There's no requirement that governments build these huge bloated infrastructures based on
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.700]   borrowed money.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.240]   There's no requirement by that.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.520]   There are many governments in the world that run their finances very well.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.460]   You could go to Singapore and you can see a model government, right?
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.680]   You can go to many countries and you can say, "Hey, this country doesn't borrow a lot of
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.680]   money.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.480]   This country doesn't create bloated welfare systems.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.440]   This country is actually profitable.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.880]   They're competent."
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.140]   But you can also look around and say that there are countries that are completely incompetent.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.520]   So on a fiscal level, what you have in the United States is you have complete and gross
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.880]   incompetence on a fiscal level.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.760]   You have utter incompetence fiscally.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.200]   So fiscally can go on for a while, right?
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.200]   That can happen.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.360]   Now what about monetarily?
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.020]   You could, in theory, if you are committed to the theories of Keynesianism and the way
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:23.960]   that modern policies are managed, you could say, "We could have a competent federal reserve."
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.740]   And I think for the most part, you can have good evidence to believe that there's a fairly
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.460]   competent federal reserve.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:35.820]   Of all of the people associated that I've just mentioned with regard to the bureaucrats
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:45.400]   handling Centers for Disease Control or pandemic infections teams in the United States, they've
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.740]   proven thus far to be generally incompetent with sparks of brightness.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:56.600]   Fiscally, the US government is fiscally incompetent with no sparks of brightness whatsoever.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.460]   The Federal Reserve, monetarily, mostly competent right now.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.260]   But I get concerned about how long that competence lasts.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.720]   So I think that they're competent.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.640]   I don't generally believe in the underlying theory of Keynesianism.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.800]   I think that the way that it's done is a very modern experiment that the vast majority of
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.880]   countries in the world have decided to engage in.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.780]   And I don't think it lasts.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.280]   I don't think it lasts.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.140]   But I'm hoping it lasts a little bit longer.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:27.640]   So I'm ranting, but that's the best I got for you.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.640]   You got another question?
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Thanks.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.640]   I will say, I think what you're saying about panic, I don't think panic is a good word.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:40.680]   But we should always react at an appropriate speed for the urgency of the situation.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.080]   And the key is to always do that in everything, every day.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.480]   And then being able to recognize when the situation changes, and realize that I was
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.820]   chainsawing, and I didn't need to act urgently.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.900]   I should be slow and careful.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:59.400]   Now I'm bleeding to death, and I need to act a different action much more urgently.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.960]   100% agree, and I'm sorry for using the word panic because you're exactly right.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.440]   There's never a good time to panic.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   If by panic we mean that adrenaline pumping, got to do something, freak out, no.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.160]   The time if you cut your leg with a chainsaw and your femoral artery is bleeding, don't
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160]   panic.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.860]   Call for help as fast as you can.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:25.680]   Look around for something that can be used for bleeding control, even as an improvised
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.680]   method.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.680]   Don't put pressure on it, and ask God to forgive your sins.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.920]   You don't panic, you respond quickly.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:32.920]   Right.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.960]   And that's always, even in non-emergencies, doing the best thing directly and immediately
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.680]   is an important life skill I'm seeking to gain.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.680]   Exactly.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:50.360]   So if you have time to pivot to a completely non-emergency and coronavirus related question,
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.360]   I have one.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:59.320]   I think that I have a, for lack of a better term, I'll call it a working class mindset.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   I've heard the term poverty consciousness, that I think, I'm not sure I totally have
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:11.040]   that, but to some extent, what are your thoughts on helping to overcome that?
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:19.440]   I make pretty good money by American averages, probably as much or more than anybody in my
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:26.320]   family or my in-laws has made, makes, or ever made, but not, you know, it's about $80,000
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320]   a year.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:35.120]   And so I think that I am sort of mentally, I guess stuck would be the right word in moving
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.240]   beyond that and thinking like a non-working class wealthier person, if that makes sense.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.240]   It does.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.760]   I love the question.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.080]   I've got one more caller on the line, since we spent so much time on your first one, and
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.160]   it's just hard for me to pivot from kind of these serious topics, so these urgent topics
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.680]   to that, which is very important.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.500]   Do me a favor, call in next week and I'll try to remember to put you first in the queue.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:05.040]   And let's start with that because I'd love to start next week's Q&A show with that question.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   Fair enough?
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.040]   Absolutely.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.040]   Awesome.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   Thank you very much, Joshua.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   All right.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   Final call of the day.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   We go to Illinois.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040]   Welcome to the show.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   How can I serve you today?
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.040]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.040]   This is Sean.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   Can you hear me?
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   Yes, sir.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.040]   Go ahead, Sean.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.040]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   Thanks for all of your work on this topic.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.680]   A few weeks back, you said like now is the time to do things before panic sets in and
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.680]   act appropriately, so I appreciate your thoughts there.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.000]   One of the things I'm thinking about moving forward with regards to paper assets, and
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.880]   I apologize if this question is going to ask, this is the first few minutes of the call.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.400]   You know, I don't totally ascribe to the Dave Ramsey mindset, but I do think, I always hear
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.120]   him talking about growth funds and income, international, all that jazz.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.800]   I wondered if you had any resources as to the best way to identify good growth funds,
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.800]   whether it be books or articles.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.160]   Obviously, specifically growth stocks are just those that don't really pay dividends.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:07.960]   I wondered if you could just shed some light on a more aggressive investing approach as
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.880]   we, I think, you know, those opportunities are going to be there.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   Sure.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:15.360]   So, the thing that's always been weird.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.080]   So, does Dave Ramsey, to your knowledge, does he still recommend when he talks about mutual
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.400]   fund investing, he used to say his recommended portfolio is that you put together a portfolio
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.720]   of growth, growth in income, aggressive growth, and international, and basically that you
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.120]   divide it 25% between each of those or something like that.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.000]   Is that still the language that he uses currently to your knowledge?
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.640]   That's correct, and I'm not, it's definitely still current.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:45.760]   I'm not necessarily looking to follow that exactly, but I definitely think there's some
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.760]   efficacy to growth stocks.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   Okay.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.880]   So, this has always been something that I've never understood why he uses those words,
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.600]   because if you go to any non, you know, Dave Ramsey ELP, and you say, "I want to buy some
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600]   growth.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.720]   I want to buy some growth in income.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.080]   I want to buy some aggressive growth, and I want to buy some international," with the
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:12.960]   exception of international, those just simply aren't really categories that are used, generally
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.680]   speaking, in the mutual fund industry.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.040]   It's not that, they do make sense to some degree, but they're not the way that mutual
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.320]   fund portfolios are usually constructed.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.560]   Usually the way that mutual fund portfolios are constructed, the much more common classification
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:36.280]   of mutual funds is, you know, large cap, mid cap, which stands for capitalization, the
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.480]   size of the fund, small cap, etc.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.480]   And so, it's kind of weird.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.760]   You know, when I was a financial advisor, I used to think, "How would I create a portfolio
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.700]   that matched this model fund?"
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:53.640]   Because it's just not, it's not language that's really used in the market out there, abroad.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:00.160]   Now, if you start reading mutual fund prospectuses, you do find that the mutual fund prospectus
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.160]   is very clear about the investment objectives of the fund.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:10.560]   So you'll see prospectus language that says, "This fund pursues investments in companies
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.760]   that have a significant potential for growth."
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:26.120]   Or you'll see, "This fund invests in mutual funds that have a mutual funds that," my legal
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:33.120]   prospectus language is failing me, "that pursue stability of value with good dividend payouts."
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.760]   These are the kinds of things that are used.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:46.880]   And so, back to kind of his four categories, the thing that is the most useful is difference
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.940]   between growth versus income.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:53.720]   And what that basically comes down to is, are you trying to find companies that are
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:59.480]   pursuing the growth of their company and you're hoping to make your investment largely through
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.320]   something like capital gains, versus are you trying to find companies that will pay you
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.000]   a stable income?
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.720]   And so, a balance here would be, on the one hand, you would have a company like Apple
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:15.940]   Computer that is seeking to dominate the computer marketplace, and they're not trying to pay
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:18.760]   out dividends, they're trying to grow their market share.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:23.560]   And so, somebody who invests in shares of Apple Computer is going for the growth of
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.560]   those shares.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.920]   It's a capital gain investment goal.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:33.440]   And so, that's a growth-oriented investment.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:39.780]   That's different than investing in your local utility company that has a 70% market share
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:41.920]   in that local value.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.040]   It's hard to conceive of how that company grows a whole lot, but they pay a nice dividend.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.460]   And so, that's an income-oriented investment, where what you're looking for is that dividend
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:53.600]   or that other blue chip company that pays dividends.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.520]   Those are the kinds of...
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.200]   That's kind of what he's going for.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.320]   Now, when you get to it and you say, "Okay, what's the difference between a growth and
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.200]   an aggressive growth?"
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.080]   Well, that's a really hard difference to articulate.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.400]   Basically, usually, if you are going to try to put that into more normal language, an
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:17.720]   aggressive growth fund would be the kind of fund that is pursuing smaller companies that
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.320]   have the potential to grow a whole lot more.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.680]   At least, it's usually considered that way.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.720]   So, you might look and say...
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.840]   I mean, Coca-Cola is not considered a necessarily growth company.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.880]   I'm just trying to think of a brand where you would say, "This is a mature company in
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.440]   a mature market."
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:42.240]   And so, we want to grow, but that's different than saying, "We're going to make more of
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:47.200]   a speculative investment on a promising drug manufacturer."
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:53.080]   We want aggressive growth because we want this drug manufacturer to develop the cure
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:59.320]   for COVID-19 and sell it all around the world or something like that.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.560]   The key thing is just simply these are weird.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.320]   His categories are really weird.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.960]   That's why it's hard to go to the marketplace and say, "I'm going to figure out how to buy
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960]   these funds."
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.960]   You can't really do it.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.760]   Now, you could sit down with, I'm sure, one of his endorsed local providers and his referral
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.480]   system that he maintains, and they would sit down and they would show you a portfolio of
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.280]   mutual funds and they would say, "This is an aggressive growth fund," or, "This is a
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.280]   growth fund."
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.520]   And it's not wrong.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.520]   It's just weird.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.840]   And so, here would be what I would say.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:37.240]   Go to a big mutual fund company that does active investing because Dave is usually,
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:42.280]   as far as I'm aware, someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but Dave is usually either at
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:47.080]   least okay with or a proponent of active mutual fund investing, last I heard.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:53.600]   And so, go to a company like American Funds, big name in the mutual fund space, in the
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:01.840]   active space, and start downloading their prospectuses for their funds.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:08.120]   What you'll see is that they will have their funds listed in this category.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.240]   Download the prospectus for the investment company of America, one of their most famous
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.880]   and oldest funds, and just read the prospectus.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.680]   Start with the sales literature, but then read the prospectus, and you'll start to see
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:25.000]   how the prospectus lays out very carefully what the investment aims of this fund are.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.920]   And then grab one of their international funds and get an idea of what they're doing, and
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:35.120]   that will start to give you the education that you need to think about what your personal
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.120]   goals are.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.320]   Now, when you go back into talking with a financial advisor, you're going to get, and
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.600]   you ask for a portfolio recommendation, you're going to get a portfolio recommendation that
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.840]   says, "We think that you should have 32% of your investment in large cap mutual funds.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:56.520]   We think that you should have 15% in mid cap, and we think you should have 10% in small
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:01.360]   cap, 5% in micro cap, 10% in real estate, 5% in precious metals, whatever."
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.680]   I lost track of the numbers, but they'll give you that based, and then X number of percent
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.120]   in bonds based upon this risk profile questionnaire.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.040]   And then within that portfolio, we're going to take this large cap, and we're going to
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:18.400]   diversify it into growth funds versus incomes, etc., and they'll give you basically a standard
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.360]   boilerplate portfolio.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.960]   But after you've read some prospectuses and sales literature, I think you'll understand
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.040]   those terms a little better.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.040]   That's where I would start.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   >>James: Great.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   That's very helpful.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   Thank you.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.400]   >>Steve: My pleasure.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.920]   That's it for the callers on today's show.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.920]   Let's see.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.560]   I had a couple people hang up, and it looks like they didn't come back.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.560]   All right.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.920]   So, thank you to the callers on today's show.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.240]   Man, I hope I've done a good job with my tone.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.920]   I hope that I've been clear.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.040]   Forgive me if I didn't.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:53.840]   I think that the conversation we had there about panic is appropriate.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.020]   We use the word panic and try to use it in different phrases, but if you actually mean
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.640]   genuine panic, no.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.520]   Genuine panic is—I can't think of a scenario when genuine panic is actually useful.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.800]   You just want to act when you see a risk.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.520]   I still wrestle—I said this publicly before—I still wrestle with how hard it is to say some
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:23.400]   of these things in public, knowing that if history is any indication, at least in the
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.840]   United States, I'm probably overreacting.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.000]   There's this generalized idea that, A, things are going to be okay, and generally they often
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.240]   have been—often, not always.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:43.000]   If we go to a global perspective, then it hasn't always been okay.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.400]   And so, I really hope I'm overreacting, and I'm acutely conscious of saying these things
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:53.000]   out loud in public, because what happens if I am overreacting, I've overreacted on the
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:02.880]   record, and when we go back to business as usual, I've established myself as an overreactor
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.760]   and the sky is falling, right?
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.440]   I hate that.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:15.600]   But when I started this show, I promised myself that I would—I knew that I can't hope to
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.600]   not offend people.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.840]   I can't hope to be right in everything.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.540]   I'm sure that I'm wrong, and I try to acknowledge when I'm wrong, but for me, when I gave myself
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:31.200]   the permission to speak publicly, I made the commitment that I would be honest, and that
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.480]   if I was wrong, I would simply correct it.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:42.080]   And so, what I'm seeking to do is to be honest, and if I can find—if I'm proven to be wrong,
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.920]   and/or if I can—somebody can show me where I'm wrong, I'll correct it without problem.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.640]   I think it's stupid to ever expect yourself to get everything perfect.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.100]   Nobody—nobody does that.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.640]   And so, I'm seeking to be honest.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:03.440]   But I think I've done a pretty clear job of laying out the specific risk.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:08.560]   The specific risk is the viral infection.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:21.240]   I think I've laid out pretty clearly and rationally shared with you why that risk is so significant
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.700]   and where the off-ramp is, right?
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:30.080]   The off-ramp to this viral outbreak is a miracle—an effective treatment protocol, which thus far
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   is unproven.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:34.940]   We're hoping that it's developed quickly, but thus far, it is unproven.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:39.720]   There's no very effective treatment protocol that specifically attacks this particular
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.560]   virus, right, other than standard treatment protocols, try to give the body the support
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.580]   that it needs, ventilator support, etc., to fight through it.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:56.640]   I am receiving daily very serious personal messages from people in the medical community,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.640]   people with insight.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.520]   And by the way, I would solicit those.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:13.120]   I try to listen carefully and then just simply open to things, but I see risk happening.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:19.680]   And so the medical stuff is the easiest to see, because if you see a treatment being
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.340]   developed, become more optimistic.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:30.820]   To the extent that you don't see a treatment developed, expect this policy of social distancing
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:38.800]   at the easiest answer, long-term social isolation, etc., these lockdowns, expect this to be the
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.980]   tool of choice, because government officials have no other tool.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:45.980]   That's the key.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:52.480]   Imagine yourself as the director of public policy for your country of residence.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:57.080]   What other tool do you have when you know that if you have a large population, millions
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.000]   of people are going to die from this infection?
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.160]   This infection is deadly.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.260]   It is not just the flu.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:06.980]   And if it gets out of hand, it becomes even more deadly, because it completely overwhelms
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.880]   the hospital system and all of the medical resources.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.520]   It is not the flu.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.420]   It is deadly.
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:19.440]   So now imagine you're looking at that, and you know that if you don't take action, I'm
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.080]   going to use millions because of the population of the United States, if you know that you
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.980]   don't take action, it's very likely that millions of people will die.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:34.400]   You know that if you do take action, millions of people will be hurt economically, deeply
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.000]   hurt economically.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.160]   Those are your two choices.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.820]   You're on the horns of a dilemma.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:44.300]   If you do nothing, millions of people will die.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:50.900]   If you take action that you know is effective, it buys you time to find a solution.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.160]   It buys you time to find a therapeutic cure.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.360]   It buys you time to develop a vaccine.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.900]   It buys you time to not have millions of people dying within a period of months.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.480]   That's how fast this infection would spread.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:06.440]   It buys you time, but it comes with an economic cost.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.480]   So why would you not buy time?
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.280]   I would.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.920]   Now what other choice is there?
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:19.720]   That's the only morally right choice is to say we have to do this because it buys time.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:26.540]   Now you know that it comes with a huge economic cost, but the economic cost is an easier price
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.740]   to have on your conscience than the moral cost.
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:35.340]   If you were the emperor of your country and you looked down and you said, "I'm the emperor
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:41.080]   and I know that if I take this action, I'll lose millions and millions of people, but
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.200]   we'll all -- we won't all be rich, but we'll all have sort of kind of have some money and
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.360]   we'll keep economic activity going.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:54.080]   But if I take this other action and I shut everything down, we'll save millions of lives,
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:59.120]   but we might be headed for utter financial ruin."
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.520]   Which of those choices would you make?
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.760]   Which of those choices do you want on your conscience when you stand before your maker
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.180]   and say, "This was the choice that I made"?
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:10.760]   Which of those -- when you're grilled for the rest of your life, you were emperor of
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.680]   the country, you were emperor of the world, and what choice did you make?
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:17.640]   Do you want to say, "I tried to save lives and it came with an economic catastrophe and
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:21.240]   I overreacted, but at least we're all still alive because the data indicated that it was
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.460]   going to be really bad"?
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:25.500]   Or do you want to say, "Yeah, well, we don't really care that much about lives.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.400]   We just wanted everyone to stay rich"?
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:30.860]   There is no other choice.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:34.620]   So now put yourself back in that -- you're still emperor of the world or emperor of your
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.120]   country.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.720]   You've got to make this choice.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.720]   What do you do?
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:45.300]   Well, you know that the single biggest risk is the virus, okay?
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:50.840]   You know that the other big risk is the human panic, that if humans start panicking, everything
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.520]   falls apart.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:57.360]   And then you know that the financial risks are very high, but you hope that with time
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.400]   you can deal with those.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.880]   You can give money away.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.040]   You can change laws.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.600]   You can make it illegal to evict people.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.080]   You can adjust bankruptcy laws.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.080]   You can capitalize -- you can nationalize all the debt away, right?
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:13.080]   If we could just forgive all the student loans, then why can't we just forgive all the debt,
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.080]   right?
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.120]   Why not?
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.960]   And you have prominent politicians who are making their entire political campaign saying,
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.800]   "We're just going to forgive student loans."
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.240]   Well, my question is, if we can forgive student loans, then why can't we forgive credit card
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.240]   debt?
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:29.800]   And why can't we forgive mortgage debt?
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.560]   And why can't we forgive business debt?
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   Why not?
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.800]   If it's good to forgive student loans, to free up students to be able to make it in
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.760]   America instead of being overburdened by their student loans, then why isn't it a good thing
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.640]   to go ahead and free up all the homeowners?
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.080]   After all, just think of how the economy would boom if you didn't have to pay a mortgage
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.080]   right now.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.800]   And if that's a good idea, then why not free up the businesses?
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.200]   Because if the businesses are servicing their debt, then that just is really hard for them.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.560]   So let's just forgive everything, right?
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.940]   This is the economic system that you're in.
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:04.680]   So back to your emperor of the world.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:07.260]   You're desperately hoping to buy time.
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:12.240]   You're desperately hoping that if you bring down quarantines, if you say, "That's it.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:17.060]   We're shutting things down," at least you have some time to possibly deal with the economic
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:20.440]   outfall of that, right?
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.640]   At least you have some time for a new therapy to be proven, a new drug to be tried, a new
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.320]   machine to be developed.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:31.100]   Somehow you have the time to turn all Tesla manufacturers into ventilator manufacturers
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:34.280]   and save millions of lives because now we have enough ventilators.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.640]   You're trying to buy time.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.080]   So you're killing the economy to try to buy time to save human lives, which is the right
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.080]   decision.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.080]   That's the morally correct decision in that situation.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:50.080]   And it's going to be incredibly politically costly because if it works, as it can, as
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:57.020]   it will, I hope, as it will, what will happen is that you will have a few thousands or tens
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.580]   of thousands of deaths instead of millions.
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:06.040]   And everybody will tell you that you were an idiot because you killed the economy to
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:12.480]   save millions of lives, but millions of people didn't die and it was a complete overreaction.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.480]   But at least you'll go to your grave as emperor of the country.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:19.100]   You'll go to your grave knowing that you did the right thing with the information that
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.380]   you had.
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.880]   But what's the economic risk?
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:29.380]   Well, the economic risk is unknown.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.420]   Now is it possible there's a perfect dance?
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:37.540]   Is it possible that the government can magically do all these things?
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.540]   Sure.
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:39.540]   Sure.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.540]   Sure.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:41.540]   Sure.
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:42.540]   Sure.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.540]   Sure.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:44.540]   Sure.
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:45.540]   Sure.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.540]   There were a lot of people that predicted the end of the world in 2008.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:47.540]   If we give away trillions of dollars in bailouts, it's all going to fall apart.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:48.540]   Well, it didn't.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.500]   So there's a good chance it doesn't now.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.620]   And man, I hope that's right.
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:35:02.060]   But on the other hand, you should see that there are some fundamental rules in the world.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:04.380]   There are some fundamental laws.
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:08.960]   But those laws depend on human psychology.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.260]   If you were to go back to 1950 and you were to go to an economist and you were going to
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.240]   say, "Listen, you know what we could do?
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:22.900]   We could just end the gold standard and we could just get rid of the connection of the
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:26.020]   dollar to gold and it'll be great.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020]   And you know what?
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.020]   It'll never fall apart."
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.020]   You would have had everyone say, "Are you crazy?
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.900]   No, of course we can't do that."
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:32.460]   Except some people said you could.
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.460]   So then it happened, right?
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.900]   You end the connection to gold, right?
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:39.020]   Now you have complete and total ability with the government, completely unconstrained by
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:46.920]   any connection to a physical substance, which allows politicians to say, "Well, you know
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.920]   what?
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.920]   We can give you money.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920]   We can forgive this.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   We can nationalize this.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.920]   We can give that away here.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.280]   We can take this industry over.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.700]   We can spend more."
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.440]   And those politicians come to power.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.920]   And other people look around and say, "You know what?
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.800]   The way to come to power is to say, 'Vote for me.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.660]   I'll forgive all your student loans.'"
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:04.440]   And it works.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.080]   And you go through an entire generation.
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:11.480]   And you had all the doomsdayers, all the doomsayers and doomsdayers saying, "Well, the government
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.960]   might one day owe a trillion dollars of debt, and that'll be a catastrophe."
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.440]   Then you get past a trillion dollars of debt, and it's not a catastrophe.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.000]   "Well, maybe it'd be ten trillion."
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.760]   And it's not a catastrophe, and nothing falls apart.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.800]   And so what happens is this feeds this idea.
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:27.520]   There's no limit.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520]   There's no limit.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.880]   Well, I ask you the question, what do you believe?
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:40.760]   Do you believe there's a limit or there's no limit?
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:47.200]   The answer to that question is probably going to make it your next course of action obvious.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.440]   I don't know what the limit is.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.960]   And man, I hope that limit isn't reached this year.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:59.960]   I have told my wife, and I can't get any more honest than what I said.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:05.800]   I've told my wife, I said, "Listen, I think that within our lifetime, I think within our
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.600]   lifetime we're going to see massive change."
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.680]   And my best estimates have always been at some point in the coming decades, notice all
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:22.000]   the room I give myself, at some point in all the coming decades, this financial and economic
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.680]   system, it has to come apart.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:33.440]   Now what I'm hoping is that it comes apart very slowly, and that it comes apart with
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.720]   room to unravel.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.920]   And so you can have some bankruptcies here, you can have some changes there.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.840]   Just like when you solve government finances, how do you do it?
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.060]   Well, you do it in bankruptcy, right?
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:47.520]   But that bankruptcy ideally is a whole lot of little bankruptcies.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.680]   Okay, we're going to means test Social Security.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.240]   So if you have more than $300,000 you're no longer getting, or a million dollars, you're
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   no longer getting Social Security.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.200]   And then three years later, well, that was too much.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.640]   So if you have more than $500,000 you're no longer getting Social Security.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:06.060]   Or if you have this amount of income coming in, now you have to pay more money for Medicare,
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.060]   or we're going to tighten this.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:11.800]   And when you do things little by little, incrementally, then you can soften the pain.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:16.400]   If you elected Joshua, Emperor of the World, and you know that Joshua would like to end
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.220]   all that stuff, theoretically, right?
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:22.880]   But Joshua as Emperor of the World would never come in and say, "Let's cut it.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.280]   Let's just cut it all right now."
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.280]   That is awful.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.080]   That is terrible.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.280]   Any parent in the world knows you don't do that to your children.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:33.800]   The worst thing in the world that you do as a parent is if you ever go in and your children
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:38.460]   are playing happily at the park, and you walk in and you say, "Children, stop right now
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.460]   and go get in the car."
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:43.020]   Your children melt down, right?
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:46.680]   And so you learn as a parent, one of the first lessons you learn, you don't do that.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.720]   You set expectations for your children.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.200]   You set expectations and you say, "Listen, at this time we're going to go."
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.800]   And then I always give a five-minute warning, right?
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.200]   And I want them to respond properly no matter what.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:03.080]   If I say, "Stop playing, get in the car," I'd like to hear a chorus of "Yes, sir, daddies,"
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:09.360]   and my perfect, obedient little children trot happily with good attitudes to the car.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   I'd like that.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.900]   We're not there.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:12.900]   Maybe someday we will.
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.120]   Who knows?
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.360]   That's the goal, but of course we never get that.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.360]   So what do I do?
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.880]   So I give warnings and I say, "Okay, five minutes."
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.120]   And I set expectations in advance of here's what's going to happen.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.520]   That's effective leadership, is you do your best to set expectations.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.160]   Now if it's an emergency and the children are going to get mowed down by an incoming
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.400]   asteroid, I'm going to say, "Go to the car," and when they start crying, I'm going to yell,
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.800]   "Go now," and probably the fact that I'm yelling is going to spur them to action.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.240]   I don't yell.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.820]   And they're going to be so scared that they're going to just run, but that's what's required.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:49.440]   And so what you look for and you hope for is incremental change over time.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.920]   And so what I have hoped for as long as incremental bankruptcy, incremental adjustments.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:58.240]   That's been the idea.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:05.600]   But that doesn't account for a genuinely serious global viral infection.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:11.480]   That doesn't account for the possibility of going from 3% unemployment one week to three
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.160]   weeks later, 20% unemployment.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.440]   That's a shock that is insane, insane.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:23.560]   That is unprecedented in human history.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:29.360]   And so when something like that is unprecedented, it has unprecedented results.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.040]   Now we all hope that you can soften the landing.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.420]   Maybe the government can soften the landing and give $2,000 away to everybody.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:39.960]   Maybe the government can bail out all these people and whatnot.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.360]   I sure hope so, because I want to live in that world.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.160]   I do not want to live in doomsday world.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.160]   I don't like it.
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.160]   It stinks.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.520]   I hope it's that way.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.240]   But at the end of the day, I still have a responsibility to my family, my wife, my children,
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.320]   my extended family.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.120]   I still have a responsibility to my neighbors.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.160]   I still have a responsibility to you to try to find your best path through it.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:06.860]   And you don't get to choose whether you live in the roaring nineties or whether you live
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.520]   in the plague-ridden twenties.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.520]   What you have to do is you have to respond to the evidence that you see.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:30.360]   That's all I got.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.320]   I will be thrilled if I'm wrong, but that's what I see.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.120]   Watch the news carefully.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.960]   Take prudent precautions in your own life.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.880]   Consider what you can do day by day.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:48.200]   Do not panic, but respond to the things that you see.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.920]   In the worst, if you're wrong and you've responded, you've thought it through in your head, if
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.320]   you've taken certain actions, if you're wrong, there might be a small price to pay for that.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.720]   I think I've done it in the examples that I've given.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.080]   I think I've tried to give fairly prudent examples.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:08.280]   If you bought food, okay, worst case is you eat it or you give it away to somebody who
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.440]   needs food.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.360]   Worst case is you feed it to your chickens.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:18.400]   I'm about to go, when I close this show down, I'm about to go buy more food.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.280]   Worst case scenario is I feed it to the chickens and it gets used up.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:31.560]   It's not a big financial cost to me in terms of my overall financial picture, but it helps
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.280]   me sleep better and it's insurance.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.720]   So I go here, I'm going to go get more money out of the bank.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   What's the cost?
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.040]   It's just insurance.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.560]   The biggest cost is maybe I've sparked a financial panic here.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.440]   I sure hope not.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.920]   But with the pace of change right now, the things that I never would have imagined, that's
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.840]   not true, I would never have believed three weeks ago that I would record the show that
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.440]   I just have because of the risk to me.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.480]   Professionally I would never have believed it.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.720]   I could imagine it because I've imagined the scenarios and I've done courses on this stuff
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.720]   for a long time.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.480]   I've thought about this stuff for a long time.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.400]   I never would have believed it.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.360]   Well, you just heard it.
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.360]   Thank you.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.720]   May you have a good weekend.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:27.400]   Try to take all the good that you can out of this stuff.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:34.960]   If you respond to circumstances early, then you can get good growth out of it.
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:36.960]   You can get good benefits out of it.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.280]   I know that this is a sober show.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.040]   I know this is a sober tone.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.480]   I remain generally optimistic.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.160]   One of the things that you see is in human ingenuity is you see opportunities.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.840]   Even in a worst case scenario, let's say that everybody goes bankrupt.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:56.920]   One of the things that happens is in the same way that when a fire sweeps through a forest,
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:03.480]   it leads to new and fresh growth, when you have massive times of financial panic, there's
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.480]   a cost to it.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.480]   People die.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:07.920]   Genuinely, I'm not being hyperbolic.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.560]   People die.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.000]   But there also is in the wake of it new opportunities.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.560]   If you've ever worked with somebody who has gone through bankruptcy, bankruptcy gives relief
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:23.520]   to people in a way that is powerful.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:26.980]   Bankruptcy can also give relief to governments.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:31.920]   Bankruptcy can give relief to all kinds of things.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.800]   Now those things can be painful, but bankruptcy can give new relief.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.840]   So just the metaphor of a forest fire is an appropriate thing to think about.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.360]   The forest fire looks like an awful thing.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.960]   If you're standing in it and it's coming up the hill and you're about to die, it is an
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.960]   awful thing.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:59.480]   But the forest fire also gets rid of all the old dead wood, gets rid of all the old dead
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.480]   wood.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480]   It sparks new life.
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.480]   It opens up the canopy.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:05.000]   It allows the forest to regenerate itself.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.440]   And that's what even happens with governments.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.400]   When you study all the governments that have gone bankrupt and have defaulted on their
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.880]   debt, it gives new ability.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.420]   It gives new life.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:16.560]   And so if that's the United States, again, I still think it's premature.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.120]   I don't think we're there.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:19.160]   I do not believe that.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.680]   I don't think that.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:27.240]   But trying to stay ahead of at least a few weeks ahead of the curve, if that's the United
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.900]   States, okay.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:36.480]   If you're prepared to feed your family, if you're prepared to unite with your neighbors,
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.220]   you're prepared to do that, it can be the kind of thing that leads to opportunities
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.220]   on all sides.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.600]   There's no reason to be...
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:46.680]   There's reason to be optimistic.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.840]   It's interesting, this morning Carl Richards, who I really like, he's been on the show,
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:52.200]   he wrote the One Page Financial Plan.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:53.200]   He's a financial advisor.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:57.640]   He's most famous at this point for being the New York Times sketch guy where he writes
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:00.680]   all these sketches about...
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:03.120]   He's so good at just taking a concept.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.360]   And Carl is committed, deeply committed, which I appreciate as I am as well, to being a voice
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:12.680]   of positivity in a difficult time.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.880]   And so this morning Carl wrote a tweet.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.120]   He said, "I have no idea how, I have no idea when, but listen to me my friends, things
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.120]   will get better."
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.600]   Now that's very true, right?
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.760]   Wouldn't you agree?
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.200]   If you're older than eight, you know that life gets better.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.960]   It gets worse, it gets better.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.640]   Life is filled with cycles.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.800]   And so Carl says, "I have no idea how, I have no idea when, but listen to me my friend,
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.800]   things will get better."
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.040]   I love that.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:49.440]   I responded and I said, "Sure, but they can also get far, far worse for a very long time
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:52.280]   before they get better."
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:57.280]   Now that's not quite as fun and as happy, but it also happens to be true.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.040]   Because if you're over the age of eight, you've probably also noticed that in your life things
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.260]   can get far, far worse for a very long time before they get better.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:10.640]   And I don't want to be an optimist who just simply always believes that, "Hey, everything
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.640]   is going to be great."
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.640]   That's stupid.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.960]   I also don't want to be a pessimist who just believes everything is going to be bad.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.480]   That's stupid.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:28.080]   I want to be a realist who looks at the situations at hand, who looks at the opportunities and
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:36.160]   says, "Facing these opportunities, facing these realities, I'm going to behave in the
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:39.680]   appropriate way given the risk."
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:45.960]   The optimist, the forest fire is coming up the California Canyon during fire season.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.260]   You've gotten a notice on the news and an emergency alert on your smartphone.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:54.440]   The optimist looks at that fire and says, "That fire is not going to come through my
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.120]   house.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.960]   I'm just going to stay here and believe the best.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.080]   I'm going to think positive thoughts in the face of that forest fire."
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.320]   The pessimist looks at the fire and says, "I've just got to sit here because that fire
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.480]   is coming so fast I can't get away.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.600]   So I'm just going to sit here and die."
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.360]   The realist looks at the fire, looks at their car and says, "I don't know if I can make
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.720]   it or not, but I am getting out of here if I possibly can," and goes as fast as they
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:26.800]   can to the car and runs.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.360]   And then the realist adjusts along the way.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.280]   If they realize they can't outrun it, they look desperately to figure out, "Is there
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:33.360]   a way that I can survive this thing?
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.440]   Is there a body of water that I can throw myself into and is there a way that I can
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.280]   survive the deprivation of oxygen or is there a way, what can I do along the way?"
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.880]   That's realism.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.640]   So optimism and pessimism are both intellectually stupid.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.120]   Forgive the hyperbole.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.880]   I just don't know a better word.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:54.120]   They're intellectually stupid.
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.120]   Take the realistic path.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.360]   Take a firm look at the world.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.200]   Take a firm grasp on reality as best you can.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:03.240]   Listen to multiple voices.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.460]   Ask people to defend their arguments.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.920]   Give you the reasons why.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.880]   And then look at your life and take whatever actions you believe are appropriate in light
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:12.880]   of that.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.720]   That's the best I got for you.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.720]   Have a good weekend.
