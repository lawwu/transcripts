[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.520]   I recently returned from Camp Mustache Southeast 2017 where I spoke.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   You heard that on episode 413 of the show.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.120]   I did a bunch of interviews while I was there.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.680]   And today I'm going to share with you the audio of one of the most interesting interviews
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.760]   that I did while I was there, an interview with a man named Bill who achieved financial
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.520]   independence his own way.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   I keep forgetting to start my mic.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.320]   A show dedicated to providing you with the stories and examples of other people who lived

[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.760]   in 10 years or less.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.560]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:17.040]   Today it's inspiration hour on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400]   Over the coming weeks I'll be bringing you a bunch of interviews.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.200]   I did interviews with all kinds of people.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.760]   I did an interview with Mr. Money Mustache, with this Bill, with all kinds of interesting
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.440]   people, several couples of people who've had interesting stories, some younger people who
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.720]   are pursuing financial independence, some older people pursuing financial independence.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.920]   I think all these interviews have things to offer.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.200]   So there are a total of about nine of them in the can that I'll be releasing to you in
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   coming weeks.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.280]   But today I'm going to leave you or start you off with what may have been my favorite.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   Let's do this interview with a man named Bill who achieved financial independence.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.120]   You're going to hear the whole story.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.200]   Now let's just start with the story.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.960]   Bill welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.760]   So we're here at a very, what's the right adjective to use, a very select group of people
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.800]   here at Camp Mustache Southeast 2017.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.520]   And when we were going around doing introductions last night you introduced yourself.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.160]   You said, "I'm just the old guy.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.520]   I've done this for years and I feel good and validated when I hear young people doing the
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   same thing."
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.960]   So of course that immediately piqued my interest and I want to make sure that I got you on
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.080]   the microphone and hear a little bit of your story.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.240]   So tell us a little bit about your story, especially as it relates to money and financial
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   independence.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.720]   I think I should start with my mom.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   So when I was at a young age, my mom introduced me to the idea of financial independence.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.360]   So I'm currently 48.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.640]   So this was back in the 70s when I first heard this concept of having financial independence
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.960]   and understanding what it meant.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   At what age?
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.020]   I'd say I was probably seven.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.400]   Was she financially independent?
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.760]   She was on her way to financial independence.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   Was she like a Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robinson, like your money or your life back in that
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   age?
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.360]   No, definitely not.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.780]   So I was always understanding the concept of having enough money and it wasn't dissimilar
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.000]   to Jim Collins' idea, JL Collins of the FU money, of having enough money that there was
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.520]   nothing that was going to rock the boat too badly to allow me to keep going on the track.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.360]   So even at a very young age, I was making money and saving money and I never had a problem
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   saving.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.560]   So definitely the key to my financial independence, which happened probably in my late 30s, was
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.640]   an extreme saving rate and all equity investments when I did have money to invest.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.160]   So a lot of the things that are being sort of pushed now are things that I naturally
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.560]   came to long before there were blogs, et cetera.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:02.600]   And a combination of, as JD Roth says, patience and an all equity investment portfolio back
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.720]   when things were extremely cheap and staying the course has gotten me certainly to the
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.840]   point I am now in combination with a much greater than 50% annual savings rate.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.000]   So with your mom at least planting the idea in your head, back in the early days, your
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.640]   late teens, early 20s, what did that look like?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.200]   Did you follow through at that time or did you have a...
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   Yes.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.040]   So at that time, I mean the first job I was really making money was when I was 10.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   I had a paper route in my town in New Hampshire and I kept collecting more and more customers
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   and I was subcontracting that out and saving 75%.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.420]   And the money that I did spend, I bought things that helped me do the paper route better or
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.920]   helped me enjoy doing it more, like having a radio on my bicycle.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.400]   So her lead, rather than forcing me to do it, she led by example.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.680]   And I saw the comfort that she had compared to some of my other friends who were less
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.000]   mustachians since here we are at Camp Mustache.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.760]   Got to pay homage to the brand.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.440]   So their parents had cool new cars, which we never had, or they had fancy clothes or
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.640]   cool new sneakers or a bicycle that had shock absorbers on it.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   And we didn't have any of that stuff, but when things happened like the water heater
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.200]   failing or whatever, there was not even a ripple that went through our lives because
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.840]   she had been taking care of all that.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.720]   So I saw that and it made it a lot easier to follow in her footsteps because I saw that
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   it made sense.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.000]   It just was the way it was.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Did you go to college?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I did.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I went to Boston College.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.120]   I graduated in 1990.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.440]   And what type of work did you do getting out?
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.780]   I was immediately recruited by a joint venture Japanese-American management consulting firm.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.640]   And I worked there for six months before I realized, about two months into it, that I
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.820]   couldn't stand it.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.560]   But it got me back to Japan, which is where I had gone for my junior year abroad.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.680]   And it got me a visa.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.880]   And luckily, through a connection I had made by talking to strangers, which is something
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.360]   I've been doing my whole life, again, cued by my mom to not be afraid of strangers, but
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:18.000]   to glean them for information or to ask them for it and glean it from them, was that I
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.920]   found somebody who I ended up bumping into at the Japanese embassy in Boston who gave
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.720]   me a multiple re-entry visa, which allowed me to, say, take this job and shove it to
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.640]   that first management consulting firm.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.760]   And I didn't have to then leave because I didn't have a sponsorship.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.000]   So that was really the first step, because then I could start taking on work, things
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.280]   that I enjoyed doing in Japan, and not worry about having to do things in order to stay.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.440]   So then I had a variety of really cool jobs in Japan that made really good money, because,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:55.360]   again, I was just naturally frugal and banking tons, and being able to do whatever I wanted.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.880]   I still had to pursue money, but I was working for myself as opposed to being tied to, like
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.280]   most expats there, tied to an English teaching gig or a multinational corporation that's
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.240]   funded their stay while they work for Goldman Sachs, for example.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   Were you in Japan as just kind of for the adventure of it?
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.560]   So I was getting a liberal arts education, had no clue what to do.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.520]   I doubled in English and sociology.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.440]   And my brother, who is a mentor, had already gone ahead, he's five years older, he spoke
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.400]   fluent Mandarin.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.040]   And he said, "If you really don't know what you want to do or where you're going to go,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.040]   learn a language."
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.960]   Everything, he said, "You're smart.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.280]   People are, they'll hire you because you're a blank slate, and they can train you to do
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.240]   what they want, but they can't teach you how to learn how to speak Japanese, for example."
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.640]   And so his advice was, "Are you interested in anywhere in Asia?
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.000]   Because I think it's going to go somewhere."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.160]   And he's my big brother, and I said, "Sure."
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.880]   And I wanted to go to Korea, but my college wouldn't allow me to go there, so I defaulted
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.480]   to Japan.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.080]   And it was good advice.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.420]   I learned Japanese pretty quickly and well, and was recruited by that company entirely
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.040]   based on my decent grades and my fluent Japanese.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.680]   Do you have any guess or knowledge or remembrance of your savings rate during those early years
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.160]   in your career?
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:25.200]   I would say my savings rate in my first year in Japan was probably upwards of 60%.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   Did it climb from there?
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   Go down?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.600]   Yes, it climbed from there.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.520]   And the other big difference is that now that I've achieved financial independence, I was
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.640]   talking to another, one of the conference attendees today, my lifestyle has not changed
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.880]   very much.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.880]   So many people, as they make more money, they expand into as much money as they make.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.280]   I lead a very similar lifestyle, maybe not as frugal as I was as a 20-year-old in Japan,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:11:00.080]   but it's not really that different than it was 15 years ago when it was, I was dating
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.720]   my wife and living in San Francisco and having fun.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.160]   I didn't have a fancy car then, I don't now.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.560]   I didn't have tons of stuff then.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.160]   I actually had this T-shirt 15 years ago.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   That's impressive.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   And these shorts a decade ago and these shoes that I got from my neighbor.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.680]   So that's just sort of built into the way I am.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.160]   Again, I think partially from my mother and partially from wanting to achieve financial
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.540]   independence, not necessarily through making tons of money, but through making my money
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.540]   go further.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.080]   Let me make sure I describe for the audience.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.480]   Bill has a very bushy beard.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   He looks unkempt and bedraggled.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.040]   His T-shirt has holes in it.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.280]   I get lots of free food at the homeless shelter.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.520]   The T-shirt is very nice.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.520]   The shorts are unstained.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.480]   The shoes look very fancy and expensive and up to date.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:59.400]   And he has a neatly trimmed goatee and is an upstanding looking gentleman.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.600]   So you reached a point in time at which you said, "Okay, I'm financially independent."
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.320]   And that age was?
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.680]   It's an interesting question actually because in retrospect, I realized that I was financially
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.520]   independent around 37 to 38.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.920]   And I continued to work hard and worry a lot about money, even though I had a lot.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.840]   And I just didn't grasp the power that I had financially.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.080]   And because I was alone, I've always worked alone and had a hard time sort of connecting
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.120]   with other people on a more intimate level, like we would be talking about finances.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.200]   I never really knew where I stood.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.000]   So in retrospect, I think I was financially independent easily by the time I was about
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   38.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.440]   But I didn't retire by literally moving away from where I was living and working and kind
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.280]   of leaving my business behind until six years ago when I was 42.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.560]   So between then and now is when I really identified myself as retired.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.200]   I live in Portland, Maine.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.960]   When I meet new people and they say, "What do you do?"
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.840]   I say, "I don't."
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.440]   And they are intrigued usually and they want to know more.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:24.840]   So I have a premonition that you might be the elusive retiree that I have often been
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:31.680]   searching for, excuse me, the elusive early retiree that I've often been searching for,
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.960]   somebody who actually retired.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.080]   So I'm going to find out, are you actually retired?
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   I am actually retired.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   So I take lots of naps.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.040]   I do what I want every day.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.760]   And although some of the things I do are things that other people do for work and get paid
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.520]   to do, no one can hire me.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.880]   No one can tell me what to do.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.600]   And I don't make decisions based on how much money it's going to make me.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.120]   That's my definition of retirement.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.720]   And in addition to that, you don't have a blog, you don't have a website.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.800]   You're not trying to tell people they should be financially independent or sell financially
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   independent.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.840]   You're here for fun because it's a gathering of like-minded people and it's in Gainesville,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.960]   Florida, not Portland, Maine, during the middle of the winter.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.640]   You got it.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   Absolutely.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.120]   Okay, so this is intriguing to me because you're a rare species.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.320]   I have this theory that nobody ever actually retires.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.360]   Now, of course, I know that's not true.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.900]   Some people do.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.960]   But the number of people that actually retire versus the number of people that think they
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.640]   want to retire or the number of people that talk about retirement or the number of people
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.360]   who leave a job, I find it to be very, very low.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:44.800]   Now, I'm enjoying the moment, but I have met other people who've done this and I've met
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.400]   other people who write about it.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:54.760]   But I want to explore what you've gained from this path of early retirement.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.040]   Did you hate your work?
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.880]   No, I didn't hate my work because I chose it.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.040]   So unlike a lot of people who I speak to who were on the path or even passed and have passed
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.280]   into financial independence, I, from after that job back in 1991, I've been doing all
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.640]   sorts of really cool things that made money and that I chose to do.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.400]   So I've been self-employed since 1991.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   So no, I never hated my work.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.720]   I just didn't like the idea that I had to make decisions based on how much money it
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.920]   would make.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.640]   So the analogy I like to tell people is that I hated, for example, always looking at the
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.100]   menu and being distracted by the prices.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.640]   So I didn't know if I really wanted the chicken or if I was just ordering the chicken because
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.600]   it was the cheapest thing on the menu.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:51.880]   So it was the idea that I could choose to do what I wanted to do and then secondarily
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.180]   make sure that it was something that was lucrative.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.800]   And there were plenty of times when I was younger where there were jobs that were really
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.920]   interesting to me that didn't pay as well and I didn't take.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.540]   And I think it's important to make that distinction between, as I said, now where I might do things
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.960]   that make money, but I'm not making that decision on a daily basis as to what's going to pay
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.240]   the most.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:21.800]   So again, with kudos to mustachianism, Mr. Money Mustache talks about acting like everything's
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:28.580]   free and I similarly look at acting like everything doesn't pay.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.880]   So instead of, "Oh, that's going to pay more per hour," or "That's going to make me more
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:40.060]   money in the long term," if it was all volunteer work or it was all free, what would I actually
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.520]   choose to do?
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.000]   And that's not dissimilar to really deciding whether I want the cheap salad or the expensive
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   filet mignon.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   What am I in the mood for today?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.080]   How has that changed your experience of life?
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   It's changed it in a positive way because it's given me a great deal of time to reflect
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.380]   on everything and anything.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.400]   I think a lot of people, there are multiple reasons why people work.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.960]   We all like to look at the money side of it, but there are also the benefits, the social
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   benefits of work.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.540]   I mean, a lot of people love to go to work because they love meeting the people that
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.460]   they either work for or with.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.260]   Or the distraction that work gives you from thinking about everything a little too much
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.940]   or having to make decisions about what you're really doing with the rest of your life.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:39.500]   And then on the negative side, I think that sometimes I made choices before I was financially
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:46.820]   independent that didn't get me closer to happiness or didn't get me closer to having a sense
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.580]   of fulfillment or a sense of accomplishment.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.860]   And now that I have financial independence, I can think about looking at the other side
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.260]   of the menu, but looking at it from the perspective of, is this going to gain me a great new friendship?
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.180]   Is this going to be an experience that I'm going to look back on?
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:13.880]   I'm a big fan of talking about deathbeds, but rather than in a morbid way, I think,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.140]   what am I going to think about on my deathbed?
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.500]   Am I going to wish I made 20 more grand on that deal?
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:26.460]   Or am I going to be happy that I followed that dream or that I was a kid on a train
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.540]   in Europe and I didn't get off at my stop and instead kept talking the girl across from
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.820]   me?
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.580]   I try to now embrace that.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:41.260]   And to the degree that I actually do talk to other people about this, I try to motivate
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.940]   them to think about things that way.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.300]   The longer perspective of what they're going to look back on their lives and think that
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.700]   they accomplished and what brought them joy and happiness, because it's all finite.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:19:01.460]   What types of work/job/businesses did you do from 1991 up through six years ago?
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.180]   I was the management consultant guy, right?
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   And that was just...
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.060]   So it's like McKinsey type stuff.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:14.140]   Yeah, it was helping American small businesses enter the Japanese market.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:22.140]   Basically it was technical production, semiconductors and switches and stuff like that.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:28.140]   Then I quit and went on this wild spree of doing all these things that were a blast.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.820]   For example, I was an FM DJ.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.220]   So not a DJ like modern idea of spinning discs at the party.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.740]   I was actually the disc jockey at a radio station.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.020]   It was called KBNA FM Banana.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.140]   And I worked there for a while playing music.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.140]   Let's hear your radio voice.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.140]   Come on, come on.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.500]   This is Willie M on KBNA.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.220]   There we go.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.700]   That was my name.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:58.460]   I got some great gigs because my girlfriend at the time was the cover girl for Shiseido
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.460]   Cosmetics.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.260]   So high level.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.060]   And I got to go to shoots and got offered modeling jobs.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.300]   Those of you listening can't see me, I'm an average looking guy.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.500]   I'm not a model and I'm five, eight and a half on a good day.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:20.700]   But in Japan, luckily I'm exactly Japanese height and I fit into Japanese men's clothes
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.700]   perfectly.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.240]   I'm 173 centimeters, I think.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:30.180]   So I got these great jobs because I was also an avid motorcyclist, being the face of Suzuki
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.700]   for about a year and a half.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.540]   So I got some really good gigs, modeling bikes, essentially riding bikes and having pictures
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.600]   taken of me looking off into the sunset, looking against the newest Suzuki.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.980]   So that was a blast.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.540]   And then the final big job I had in Japan was working with an advertising executive
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:55.740]   who owned a large company there and needed somebody who would tell him the truth.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.740]   Japan is filled with, as you can imagine, people who are following this sort of the
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:06.060]   status quo and there's a lot of concern about your level compared to your boss and you don't
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.060]   make waves.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.380]   He paid me to say, "That's crap."
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.580]   Or I wouldn't do it that way.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.580]   So I got paid a whole bunch to just-
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.580]   Be an opinionated jerk.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.180]   Be an opinionated jerk and not wear a suit to work like everybody else.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.420]   And that was a lot of fun.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.820]   Then I came back to the United States and essentially started my small tech consulting
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:32.100]   business in San Francisco by buying and selling Mac books.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.420]   At the time they were called Power Books and I was finding them in the newspaper before
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.940]   the internet.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.020]   And the people at, basically I was looking for one for myself.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.300]   And then in the next two weeks I saw two more that were even cheaper than the one I got
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:50.580]   myself and realized that those prices were under market and I started trading in Power
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.660]   Books.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:58.220]   And that basically made its way into a business of doing end user tech support for highly
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.220]   affluent people in San Francisco.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:15.100]   And along the way many of those people who needed somebody who was discreet and responsible
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.100]   and could find the answers to sometimes unknown questions.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.780]   I started to get a lot of other jobs.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.060]   So in many cases I became sort of a fixer.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:32.820]   So my job sort of segwayed from being a tech support guy to just being a resourceful individual
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.820]   in those people's lives.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:40.320]   There's a lot of money in San Francisco and when people who have a lot can find someone
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.980]   they trust, since I always charge the same rate for my time, because that's what I think
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.620]   an hour of my time was worth, regardless of how many literally billions of dollars some
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:57.260]   of my clients had to some of the people who were making the same money I was, I was fair.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.980]   And I loved having sort of a different job every day.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:10.340]   But eventually I moved out of San Francisco and retired to Maine.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.180]   Since you retired, have you continued to earn, have you earned any money doing similar types
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.180]   of things?
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.180]   Yep.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.500]   So your retirement was a very intentional decision, as you just described.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.420]   I'm not going to decide based on money.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.340]   I'm going to ignore the money, pretend it's all volunteer and I'm just going to go with
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.340]   that.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.860]   But since then, there have been opportunities that have been fun that have brought in additional
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.860]   sources of...
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.860]   Yes.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.620]   So there are clients in San Francisco who were despondent that I left.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.300]   So occasionally when somebody gets in touch with me with something cool, or it's one of
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:48.860]   my clients who I had, in some cases, over 15 year relationships with, I wanted to continue
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.180]   to work with them.
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.780]   So I would say yes to particular people and no, I'm retired to others.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.800]   And then within Maine, there's a great deal of opportunity.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.840]   So I've taken on the job of being a property manager.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.860]   So I have some investment property, which is again, following in my mother's footsteps.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.180]   She was a property owner and I was sort of a property manager as a young boy pushing
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.580]   the lawnmower and fixing broken panes of glass.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.460]   And then there are volunteer opportunities that have made me none, but I actually suspect
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.660]   that they may turn into money-making opportunities without even trying.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:34.420]   There's a lot of sort of kind of office space where I've said absolutely not, and then it
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.260]   turns into even more money had I said yes.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:48.020]   And now I'm trying to follow the lead of again, Mr. Money Mustache with ramping up my charitable
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:55.380]   donations or even considering starting some sort of a scholarship or something fun to
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.460]   help cool people do cool things.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.820]   Because that's going to serve me selfishly, because ultimately I think a lot of giving
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.820]   is actually kind of greedy because it'll make me feel good and somebody else wins.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.300]   So that's win-win.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:15.740]   And it'll also keep me mentally stimulated to help other people.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.740]   I'm thinking...
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.740]   I can see the smoke.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.980]   It's not something I recommend or that I do frequently.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:30.620]   As I think, what's so interesting to me about your story is in some ways you are the elusive
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.940]   early retiree, but yet you prove my theory, which is that people don't retire.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.180]   And the reason I say that is I think for you, you had to reach that point where you said,
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.180]   "I have enough money.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.380]   I'm going to make this intentional decision."
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.500]   But I can imagine that perhaps if you were around other people earlier, you could have
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.300]   made that same decision earlier.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.660]   And I'm convinced that...
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:57.340]   I don't know what the number, but something like $100,000 in the bank is certainly not
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.860]   enough money to live on for the rest of your life, but it's enough of a cushion that it
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.620]   gives you a margin between just about anything that somebody who had that much of a cushion
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.620]   of...
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.380]   To use Jim Collins' words, "F you, money."
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.620]   Somebody with that much of a cushion could make a similar decision.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.700]   As long as they're not substituting, say, lying around on the couch and gaming constantly.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.700]   Of course, then they're...
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.700]   Who knows?
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.020]   They make a lot of money as a game expert, which people do now.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.660]   That's what's so remarkable.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:37.780]   So we face this tremendous challenge of how to articulate the concept of financial independence
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:45.020]   while recognizing that financial independence is one, it's a sliding scale, it's a moving
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.900]   stages of growth, stages of achievement.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.620]   And it's also...
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.100]   It's not going to change all that much, because I am confident that if we'd been talking 20
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.580]   years ago, you would have been just as chilled out, you would have been just as an interesting
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.100]   person, you would have had all these interesting things that you were working on.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:07.300]   And so the difference between you as a worker and you as an early retiree, I'm not convinced
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.460]   it's all that great.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.940]   I think for you, it was something where you just said, "I'm gonna consciously choose never
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.100]   to think about the finances."
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.380]   But in terms of how I perceive you, I think you were probably a similar guy.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.300]   I was similar, but I had a great deal more anxiety about it.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.300]   Okay.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.820]   So I would say that's the big difference.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.900]   I agree with you.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:35.220]   I think I spent a lot of time worrying about things that in retrospect would have happened
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.220]   fine.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.700]   And I had a lot of people who were in your position, they were usually a lot older than
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.180]   you are, but they would say, "Oh, you're gonna be fine."
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.740]   And I'd say, "How do you know that?
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.660]   I've gotta pay rent and I'm not making enough money."
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.940]   And they would just look at me and say, "No, no, you're fine."
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.420]   And I didn't listen, 'cause I couldn't see what they were seeing.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:05.200]   So I suspect that some of those older people, they were typically men, sort of father figures
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.220]   who told me that, would probably say the same thing you're saying.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.740]   "Yeah, that's the same kid I met when he was 22.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.740]   Hasn't changed a whole lot."
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   You're right.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.580]   For me, it feels hugely different.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:21.340]   And as I spend more time retired, I realize not that I wasted time in between, but that
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.180]   I had to go through that.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:28.220]   I had to go through those feelings in order to enjoy where I am now.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:34.140]   And that I couldn't have retired, even if I suddenly had had as much money as I do now,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:40.240]   I would have been just as afraid, felt just as nuts about money as I did.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:50.480]   So I wasn't as chill then as I am now, but I suspect you are right, that the core way
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.180]   I am and the person who I am has not changed drastically.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:01.920]   And that I could have done it much, much sooner and been wherever I'll be in 10 years now,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.280]   had I started 10 years ago.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.120]   Your mother sounds like an amazing woman.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.320]   Yeah, she is.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   Do you have children?
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   I have a daughter.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   How old?
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   11.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.120]   Tell me what you've done.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.920]   And I'm guessing, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I'm pretty safe on safe ground
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:24.440]   here, that you deeply value what your mother sewed into you and that you're seeking to
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.400]   pass on that legacy to your daughter.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.320]   Tell me what you're doing with your daughter, what you've done at an early age, what you're
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:37.280]   doing now and what you're planning to do to pass on your mother's legacy through you to
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280]   your daughter.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:44.400]   At first, I worried much more about the answer to that question than I am now.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:51.640]   I realize increasingly that being who I am, so it's that lesson we just talked about,
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.520]   it's going to happen by itself.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.520]   I am who I am.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:03.400]   I don't try to be a mustachian, since we're going to keep going back to that theme.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.120]   I just am.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.000]   So like it or not, my daughter is seeing that, and that is the biggest lesson.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.460]   Certainly you can try very hard to teach your children things, but they learn most from
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.560]   what you're not actively teaching.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:26.720]   And I think the active things that I've done, in order to give some meat to the answer,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.560]   my daughter doesn't have a lot of the stuff that other kids have currently.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.520]   She doesn't have an allowance, even though a lot of her peers have allowances.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:46.600]   And over the years, she has seen me not buying the newest, spiffiest, coolest thing.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.960]   She's actually has made comments about the fact that every single picture of us in the
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.640]   summer, I'm wearing the same shirts.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.840]   She's like, "It's kind of neat.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.280]   You're just wearing the same shirt over, like you're just getting older.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.680]   Look at the gray hair coming in.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.140]   Same shirt, same shirt, same shirt."
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.160]   And I think that is a lesson that she's getting, is the fact that I'm not buying all this stuff,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.880]   and I seem to be pretty happy.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.160]   And then there are just some lessons when she actually asks things like renting versus
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   buying.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.520]   We're walking around, she sees for sale signs and wants to know what that concept is.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.000]   And I explained to her what I think is right about renting versus buying, and having the
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.520]   power of money work for you, and leasing, because I'm also this car guy, so I give a
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.040]   lot of people advice about cars, and making things, repairing things rather than replacing
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   them.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:47.840]   These are all lessons that I actively teach as well as passively do by example, set by
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   example, I guess.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:57.640]   So you are semi-famous under a pseudonym for the topic of cars, and your knowledge of and
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.200]   experience with vehicles, especially how to get a good deal.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:09.600]   How did you acquire your skills with being able to drive well for cheap?
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.200]   So that also was a job that I skipped mentioning in Tokyo.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   So I've been a motorcyclist my whole life, and in Tokyo I was buying and selling motorcycles
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   as well.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:27.120]   Because of my language skill and my long-term being able to stay there without an official
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:36.600]   job, I learned the official paths to getting a vehicle licensed for a foreigner.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.540]   So I could buy motorcycles cheaply and get them licensed, et cetera, and sell them to
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.680]   foreigners who were usually there for a short period of time, all licensed.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.640]   They didn't have to go wait in line, deal with the DMV, et cetera.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.360]   So this idea of buying and selling vehicles started actually back in Tokyo.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.920]   You were a fixer then.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:33:01.500]   I was making things easier for people who wanted to exchange money for hassle and time.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.720]   And most of them were actually very wealthy people who were there for short periods of
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.440]   time for their one-year stint with an investment bank, but they wanted a cool motorcycle to
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.960]   just run around town in.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:18.400]   So that was where I got into the idea of buying and selling vehicles and seeing how easy it
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.920]   was and what the spread was between them, and that a lot of it had to do with paperwork.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:30.680]   And then my own motorcycle experience, I've had, I think I'm on my 29th personal motorcycle.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.680]   That's fantastic.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.820]   Because I'm always looking for the right bike.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.820]   What type of bike is it right now?
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.000]   I currently have a Suzuki DL650 V-Strom.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Nice.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Kind of dual sport.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.600]   Dual sport 650cc bike.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:55.520]   And I started to be interested in fixing the vehicles when I had to.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:02.760]   When I was more worried about money, I started to learn to fix actual problems with motorcycles.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.900]   And then when I finally got my first car, it was one that I was going to own for a while
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   in San Francisco.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.880]   There were some things that went wrong with it, and I started to realize that I could
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.360]   treat it like anything else.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.760]   I mean, if you get multiple quotes for a hole in your roof or for braces or for whatever,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:26.960]   you could go to multiple car shops and ask what the price was to get something fixed
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.360]   and start to glean information by asking questions and what the parts were and could I bring
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.600]   parts to you and have you fix it?
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.800]   I just want to pay for your labor.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.280]   And then I started to realize that it wasn't rocket science and I could possibly do it
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.600]   myself.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.940]   So fast forward to moving to Maine where I had a great deal of time and I finally had
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.560]   my own garage.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.800]   And I'm just talking about my little one car garage in my house, not some fancy garage
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.000]   with a lift or anything.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.120]   I started to use the power of the internet and my own two hands and have, I think, the
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.720]   most important thing, which was zero fear.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.160]   I figured at any point if I really messed something up, I could call AAA and have them
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.720]   tow it to the garage and they'd fix it.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.000]   So why should I pay some mechanic to screw it up when I could screw it up for free?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.600]   And especially the fact that you didn't have to be at a job on Monday morning with a working
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.080]   car so you have time and you didn't really have to be anywhere.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   So that's a key thing because I, I, um, I'll just keep going in a moment, but I've faced
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   this myself.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   I see how simple it is to fix things oftentimes, but I also recognize how many of those projects
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.320]   go long.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.160]   And if you don't have the flexibility of time, it's been the challenge for me.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.560]   I'm not financially independent under the terms of, well, I can just do whatever.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.480]   I have family members who are, and when I observed them, one of them is just world class
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.960]   at fixing everything.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.560]   But it's also because they have the time to do the research, order the parts, wait four
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.640]   days for them to arrive, et cetera.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:56.920]   And so time makes a huge difference in having that time where I'm right in that middle where,
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.640]   okay, I could make changes, but I'm still in that.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.040]   I still have some of those pressures of my business and my job that cut into things.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.320]   And you, and you're, you know, I understand the value of convenience.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:14.080]   I mean, that's exactly what you're talking about or not being able to do that because
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.960]   you have other responsibilities or other things you'd like to do.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.520]   I luckily am in this position that I finally got myself into where I do have the time and
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   the inclination.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.640]   There are certain things that, um, for example, I have an accountant, not unlike Mr. Money
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.360]   Mustache, uh, I, I could insource that.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.640]   Like I've been sourced most things in my life because I like to learn stuff, but I, I am
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   not interested.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.920]   I'm, I'm willing to pay somebody else to do that when it comes to fixing cars.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.440]   Um, I actually like it.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.440]   I like the sense of accomplishment.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.040]   Um, it's, it's a huge high to, to fix something yourself.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   And you know, I'm probably, uh, not that much more mechanically inclined than other people
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   are.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.720]   I, I, you know, I went to prep school, I went to a fancy college, I went to go work in the
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   working world.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.280]   You know, I didn't have grease under my fingernails until much later in life, but I figured out
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.400]   that I really like it and, um, and that it's very satisfying to kind of do that work to
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.920]   actually like manual work, especially when it is so, um, binary.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.080]   I mean you fix it and it works or you don't and it doesn't.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.200]   I find it satisfying as well.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.280]   I like to do work that because so much of my work is mental, um, where you can't physically
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.840]   see the outcome of it.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:39.200]   Uh, I find it also satisfying to do things that result in a physical tangible result,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.440]   fixing the car, improving it and also the process because the process is relatively
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.980]   straightforward in many ways, a linear process.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.360]   If you understand where you're going from point a through, you know, point Z of the
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:55.000]   instructions or the process, um, you know, you can put on something nice to listen to,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.040]   a great podcast, great radio, great music, whatever.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.840]   Um, you can have a beer while you work.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.960]   You can just slow down and enjoy the process and it can be very, uh, for me, I, I, I share
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.080]   that same enjoyment of it, but then if you've got to have it done by a certain time and
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.360]   it doesn't work and the part doesn't fit, you know, my camper van, I bought my camper
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.440]   van and the generator wasn't working and so I fixed it twice and it still wasn't working
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.080]   and I was like, I've got to get this thing working.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.320]   So finally I admitted defeat and took it to the shop and they fixed it and got it working.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.080]   But uh, but I, I, I agree.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.880]   So that's one of your secrets is, is your fix of cars.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   Yep.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   So I fixed them.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.200]   Uh, and when I don't know how to fix it, I'm certainly happy to involve a professional.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   That's fine.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:46.160]   And it has, uh, also allowed me in many ways to sort of spread the word actually.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.960]   Um, cause a lot of times I end up selling these cars to friends or friends of friends,
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.720]   et cetera, um, for cost or very close to it because I'm not really in it to make money.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.480]   It's more that I, uh, not dissimilar again to, to Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.960]   I see it as, um, as a form of environmentalism.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:13.080]   Um, actually someone here on the trip asked, you know, should I get rid of my, uh, Toyota
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.840]   Tundra truck and buy a Prius?
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.420]   And he's an older guy.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:23.500]   He drives less than 5,000 miles a year and he really loves that truck and has 150,000
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.780]   miles on it.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.540]   And I said, absolutely not.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   Uh, sure.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.660]   The, um, the easy answer would be, oh yeah, you should have a Prius.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.580]   It's going to get two to three times the gas mileage of your truck.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.300]   But what about the environmental impact of him buying a whole nother vehicle?
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.300]   Then what happens to his truck?
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.020]   Someone else is going to be driving it.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.380]   And I'm sure people who are listening are going to make all sorts of arguments against
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380]   it.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.140]   But at the end of the day, what I told him is the lowest hanging fruit is just drive
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   less.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:54.300]   If you drive your car half as much as you do now, you've just doubled the time that
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.660]   you have that vehicle per gallon.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:01.660]   Uh, and he said, yeah, I guess I don't have to drive to the gym every day.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.180]   And I said, yeah, you don't, of course you don't.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.620]   And I didn't, you know, and I said, Hey, I'm not Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.740]   Cause he was kind of scared.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.380]   I know you're not going to like this truck.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.820]   I said, no, I'm not going to beat you over the head.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.820]   I know you like that truck.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.260]   I'm not going to tell you to get rid of it, but just drive it less.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.260]   Maybe you can just walk around your neighborhood on Tuesdays and Thursdays instead of walking
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.700]   on the treadmill at the gym.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.620]   And there you've just massively reduced your footprint.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.780]   And he was happy to hear that.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.740]   You know, I, I was all for that.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:36.260]   How much of a role does environmentalism play into your behavior, your decisions, your financial
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   outlook?
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.960]   I'd say it's very large.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   Sometimes too large.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:53.780]   I think there are times when for me, I worry too much and focus too hard on the environmental
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:58.120]   impact instead of the very small difference.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.420]   It would be if I didn't worry about it.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:08.780]   The case in point would be a water fight at my daughter's birthday party.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.220]   And I'm thinking the whole time about how much water are we using?
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.460]   And then I try to think, well, it's, you know, it's splashing on the ground and, you know,
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.500]   water's a closed system on our planet and that's okay.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.040]   But I still kind of get uptight about it.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:29.920]   And I also find myself occasionally still getting sort of upset when I see people wasting
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.960]   fuel, for example.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.280]   A big thing in Maine is to idle your vehicle.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   It's very cold.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.820]   People will get out of their car and leave it.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.780]   But they often will forget.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.180]   I'll see a car in my neighbor's driveway idling for an hour while they go inside and they
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.460]   were just going in to get something and then they get distracted.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.340]   And I realize I can't save the world that way.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.780]   And it's a gallon of gas.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:42:01.220]   And yes, we all need to think about the tiny things we can do, but it's not worth getting
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.260]   steamed up about, you know, to sort of make the joke.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.300]   I'm always thinking about it.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:15.620]   And interestingly enough, a little side story is that my daughter, who I never purposefully
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:22.380]   teach environmentalism to, got very upset the other day when she drew a bath for herself.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.000]   She turned on the water.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.180]   She went into her room to change.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.860]   She came back and I hear her wailing from upstairs and I run upstairs thinking something
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.860]   terrible has happened.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:32.860]   And she's really crying.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.600]   And, you know, 11-year-olds don't cry that much anymore.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.140]   You know, something's bugging her.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.140]   What is it?
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:42.900]   She said, "I forgot to put the plug in and all the water I've been, it's been on for
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:47.140]   like five minutes and that water level hasn't gotten any higher and I wasted all that hot
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140]   water."
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.660]   And she was really upset and I had to pat her back and calm her down and say, "It's okay.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.180]   You know, people make mistakes.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.560]   In the big picture, this is fine."
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.060]   And part of me was like, "Wow, I'm really screwing my kid up with like being that uptight
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.060]   about something like that."
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.020]   And then I think, "Well, no, it's good."
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:10.460]   Her reaction was a little strong, but she does understand that every drop counts.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.220]   So she is kind of thinking like me.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:17.020]   And sometimes I feel that that's a burden and sometimes I feel that that's a blessing.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.020]   It's a gift.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:24.660]   When you think of environmentalism, do you think of that as, like for you, what does
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.500]   environmentalism mean?
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:38.960]   For me, I think about it as a way for me to lessen my use of stuff.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:46.740]   So it's, I don't really think about the calculations of carbon footprints, how many tons of carbon
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:50.420]   oxide am I emitting per mile in a particular vehicle, et cetera.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:55.020]   I think about it more in terms of what am I consuming?
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   What's being used in sort of my name?
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:03.220]   So again, back to the car thing, I'm always trying to convince people actually to keep
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.020]   the car they have and fix it.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.700]   Even though maybe another car is more fuel efficient, the most efficient thing is for
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.700]   them to keep it.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:16.780]   A lot of my neighbors, when they're remodeling their houses and they remodel them "green"
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.820]   and it's LEED compliant, et cetera, I think, "Well, what about all the crap you just ripped
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.820]   out of your kitchen?
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:27.700]   You just ripped out all these nice old Formica countertops that were working perfectly.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.300]   They just didn't look cool."
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:35.460]   And the appliances that were avocado green or perhaps even as simple as white, you've
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.860]   just sent them all elsewhere.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.140]   And unless you made a very strong effort to recycle those by selling them to somebody
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.860]   else on Craigslist or reusing them in your basement or something like that, you just
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.740]   made a huge impact on our town dump.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.060]   And that's not a way.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.740]   That's just not your yard.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:56.140]   So when people are throwing things away, so I'm constantly trying to reduce the amount
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:04.020]   of stuff that I'm consuming or that by nature of consuming, I'm excreting.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.260]   How do you figure out what's enough?
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.380]   How do you figure out where the line is?
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.400]   So it's very, very difficult.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.660]   And that actually brings me back to money, which was how do you figure out what is enough?
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.260]   I think a lot of people are going to have that question.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.760]   I don't have the answer.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.740]   But that's a big question for your listeners who are interested in financial independence,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.740]   a big thing to ask.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:25.980]   How much is enough?
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:31.260]   Because had I had the insight that you came to so quickly, because you're smarter than
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:36.220]   I am, was I had enough a long time ago and I just didn't realize it.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:41.740]   So in terms of how much is enough with sort of the environmental slant, I'd like to think
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.460]   more like anything is better than nothing.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:53.840]   So if I let it mellow and only flush it down when it's brown, I've just saved a whole bunch
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.580]   more water than the guy in the next house who flushes every time he pees.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.700]   That's a good thing.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:04.140]   I don't really have to get caught up in the I didn't save enough or I used too much.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.860]   If there's an opportunity for me to use less easily, then I should.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.300]   Again it's that low-hanging fruit of the guy who I just say, "Just drive your car less.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.860]   You don't need to go get a Prius."
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.180]   Buying something else isn't going to solve this problem.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:23.180]   If you're really worried about the environmental impact of your truck, just drive it less.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   You still need it.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   You use it from time to time.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.180]   That's fine.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.180]   Drive it less.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.380]   So for me, it's not so much that there's a line for what is enough.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:36.540]   If it's better than what I would have done without thinking, then I've already accomplished
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.540]   something.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:42.100]   And that bar is set in a place where it's really easy to access so I can feel good about
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:47.260]   it instead of getting caught up in like I used to about how many gallons are being used
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:54.100]   and just looking at everything around me as being the whole world's going to hell.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.420]   It could be and perhaps ignorance is bliss in this case, but I do have to consider my
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.100]   mental health as well.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.660]   That's my question.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:11.580]   And I've often wondered, and I have some ideas in terms of how it can be done better.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.140]   Have you redesigned your house to use any other than just using less?
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:21.460]   Have you changed any of the technology of your house so that things are reused or recycled
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.500]   intentionally internally in the house or on the property?
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.060]   Some of the water that's the wastewater in my house gets reused just to a very small
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.060]   degree because I didn't want to have to go through a bunch of compliance issues with
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.140]   the city.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.820]   I did install things, for example, a wood stove insert.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:45.420]   So about 80% of my heat now is from wood from a state that's 90% wooded.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.740]   When my furnace broke, I replaced it with a much more efficient unit rather than the
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.060]   same thing that was there.
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.640]   But I waited until it broke.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.180]   I would not if that old furnace was still working, I probably would still be using it.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.620]   So I haven't made massive changes to the output.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:09.300]   Although I would say by far we have the smallest amount of garbage that leaves our house.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.060]   We recycle extensively.
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.780]   We compost.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:20.380]   And I actually purchase things with packaging in mind.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.660]   And just the simple stuff.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.920]   I never, ever forget my reusable bags.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:31.220]   It's really that little, but all those plastic bags add up.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.540]   And I reuse a lot of my garbage.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:40.500]   For example, my garage where I'm working on cars and projects and stuff is filled with
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:47.980]   old yogurt containers for storing screws and the top of a milk jug cut off as a scoop.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.500]   I look at these things and try to use them at least once again.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.460]   Almost partially, that's partially frugal because I don't want to go buy that special
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.120]   thing when I could just make it.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.820]   And then the second one is because it's just there.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.220]   I'm in the recycling bins right there in the garage and I know I'm about to drain some
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.900]   gas from an old snow blower.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.580]   So gee, that's a good plastic cup to put it in.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:14.820]   And then gee, that drained gas is kind of crappy, but my Honda Odyssey gas tank has
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.820]   20 gallons of fresh gas in it.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.740]   Half a gallon of crappy gas is not going to hurt it and it's going to get used efficiently.
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:26.100]   Because how else am I going to dispose of that in an environmentally conscious way?
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:32.360]   So I make those steps, but I certainly don't have a composting toilet.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:38.820]   My house is just on a regular street with everybody else's and I haven't made massive
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:45.340]   changes and all the changes have been either for my own comfort, like the wood stove, which
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:51.460]   I love, or because something broke and then it needed to be replaced.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:58.220]   So I have this theory about environmentalism, is just simply that environmentalists sell
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.500]   their movement the wrong way.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:07.860]   And I say they because I don't have a problem with the word environmentalist applied to
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   a person.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.220]   Like you're a person, if you want to say you're an environmentalist, fine.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.860]   It's become such a militant term in so many ways that it's got some baggage.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.460]   I like to call myself a conservationist.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.300]   To me there's a slight difference there.
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:26.860]   And the difference that I see is a difference of hierarchy and superiority.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.660]   It's a philosophical difference where it seems to me that many environmentalists, I know
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.060]   nothing about your personal philosophy, but many environmentalists look at the world and
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.860]   say the best thing that could happen would be to wipe all humans off the planet.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:45.780]   Because the world is God, the actual physical creation, the world, the natural environment
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.380]   is God and we're a blight upon it.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.900]   So I don't believe that philosophy, I don't resonate upon it.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.040]   I say that the world is here for me.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.260]   But it's also here for me to care for and to be a steward of.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.860]   And so to me I think that fits better under the word conservationist.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.400]   So I personally like that word conservationist.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:12.540]   But kind of environmentalism as I see it sells the problem of deprivation instead of the
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.820]   solution of abundance.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:19.860]   And I see two parallel tracks where it happens in terms of money and finance and also in
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.900]   terms of environmental impact.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.860]   That people often sell money and finance as deprivation.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.540]   Well you should save more because that's the right thing to do.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:34.520]   Well again to pay homage to our friend Mr. Money Mustache, we're here with him at this
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.220]   conference branded for him.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:40.460]   And one of the things that I believe he does better than anybody else in the world is he
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:47.540]   paints financial stewardship, good financial decisions, not as deprivation but as the ultimate
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.860]   luxury.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.380]   And that's what this early retiree movement is about.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.480]   It paints it as the ultimate luxury.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:58.180]   And so if you don't go through that, I've talked to people all the time, like listen,
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.740]   if you just save 75% of your income you'll be in a position to where you'll be financially
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.740]   independent seven years.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:09.260]   And they look and they view 75% of income as just this horrible deprivation.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.540]   Instead of saying, "Oh, I'll be financially independent, look how great it is."
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.420]   So frugality I don't see is any end in and of itself.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.080]   It's a process.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.460]   It's something that gains you something that you want better.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:26.900]   In the same way environmentalism, my issue a lot of times with environmentalism, is that
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:31.320]   it is focused on like, "No you can't.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.500]   No you can't drive.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.620]   No you can't fly.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.940]   No you can't live in a house.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.420]   You must live in a yurt in the woods and go barefoot and poop in a bucket."
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:44.100]   Like hold on a second, why don't we apply and say, "How can we make so that we can have
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:50.980]   everything that we want for our own human needs and comfort and luxury and make the
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.140]   environment around us better?
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:57.220]   Why can't we turn it into a surplus and live richly with it?"
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:01.380]   And so when I look at it, the thing I say about like water, is that if the water gets
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.260]   wasted for example, if the water just kind of gets flushed down the pipe, goes in with
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.220]   the sewage, I can't stand, I personally can't stand that concept.
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.180]   I hate, my house right now is just a standard apartment.
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:15.580]   And so the water goes right down in the sewer with all of the feces.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:19.700]   And that is so frustrating to me because that is the dumbest thing to do, to take drinking
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:25.740]   water and pollute it with feces, when it could be repurposed and used in so many ways.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:30.520]   And so that annoys me because it doesn't follow that principle of conservation.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.780]   But I don't want to not take a bath every day.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.020]   I don't want to take a bath once a week because, "Oh, I can only take a bath once a week."
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.500]   I want to take a rich, hot, luxurious bath every day.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.180]   But for you in Portland, I'd be thinking, "But how can I make sure that I'm using the
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:47.340]   waste heat from my wood stove to heat the boiler and it's just always hot and it's wasted
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.460]   heat otherwise.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:53.340]   So now we're using the heat multiple times in order to provide this luxury.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.300]   Then we're going to take the water, we're going to run it through a gray water system,
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.340]   we're going to use it twice, then we're going to flush it out into a reed bed."
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.540]   Well, it doesn't work in the winter, but you can come up with a version that does.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.480]   Like how do we flush it out into a reed bed?
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.100]   So then I'm using that to reeds to filter the water.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.020]   Then at the end of the reed bed, I'm going to pass the water down into my garden so it's
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.020]   used there.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:16.260]   And I'm going to put that at the top of my property so it can be used multiple times
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.380]   as it flows down through my property.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.540]   Then I'm going to take the reeds, I'm going to take those, use those as mulch, and I'm
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.620]   going to use that as a process of taking those nutrients that were grown from there and take
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.260]   it down and use it on the property.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.140]   And so the problem with it is that that's just good thinking.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.340]   That's saying, "How can I get everything I want?
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:34.680]   How can I have the luxury?
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.820]   How can I have this?
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:42.300]   But how can I do it in a way that recognizes my responsibility of stewardship and conservation
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.700]   while also recognizing that I don't serve this goal out here?"
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.460]   And that's actually one of my big issues.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:56.340]   I was glad, I was going to ask you, I was glad that you didn't define environmentalism
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.340]   in terms of carbon.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:02.620]   This is one of my biggest issues with people who think environmentalism, they think carbon.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.180]   Because then it's all about going down.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:11.140]   Instead of saying, "Well, how can we create a system that not only fills our needs, but
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:15.920]   also not just doesn't produce carbon, why don't you create a system that actively pulls
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.620]   carbon out of the atmosphere?"
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:22.180]   And that is so simple in some ways to do, and there's so many people who are doing much,
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.420]   so much progress there, but instead everyone just wants to guilt everyone and say, "No,
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.180]   you can't drive, you can't fly."
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.180]   That's silly.
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:33.780]   We could design and we could completely transform literally the planet.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.180]   I've seen it done in small test cases.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.720]   I'm convinced it's going to happen in the coming decades.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.480]   You can transform the planet and you can green the planet in such a way that you can fly
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:49.460]   every day in your luxury private jet and still have a carbon negative environment.
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.140]   But it's the wrong thinking.
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.140]   With no deprivation.
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.940]   Right, with no deprivation.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.340]   So when you attack somebody's jet and you say, "No, you can't drive," or, "You can't
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:01.420]   do that," the point about that, it's not to say that there's not a principle there.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:06.580]   Yes, you need to be careful of it, but by focusing on the positive, you create something
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.580]   that sells.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.580]   Correct.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.940]   Just like Mr. Money Mustache has done.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:18.020]   Yeah, I definitely agree with the idea of we have huge brains.
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:21.700]   Why not use that to solve the problem?
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:25.860]   Instead of either guilt, it's the carrot stick kind of analogy.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:33.380]   So I agree with you that there is, you used a term just as you were talking about, it's
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.220]   better thinking.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:43.460]   It's not always the easiest path, but it's better thinking and there is a huge incentive,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.980]   which is a really nice long hot shower.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.980]   Right.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:50.580]   Yeah, which can be done in your climate with wasted heat.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.620]   Things that would otherwise just be lost and it wasn't recycled.
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.460]   And then it becomes about the goal and the challenge of saying, "How many times can I
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.460]   use this?"
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:02.580]   I'll give you, recycling programs drive me nuts.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:07.220]   Recycling, however, as in that you're reusing, I think that's fantastic.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:14.260]   If recycling programs, as in the blue truck pulled up, was the end of the waste stream,
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.180]   I would be in favor.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.740]   But it's not for most people.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.860]   It's the very first thing.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   Correct.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.060]   And that's what to me is frustrating, is because it's inefficient.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.060]   Make the blue truck.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:29.620]   I will grant that the blue truck might be valuable, but try to put the blue truck at
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.280]   the end of the waste stream, not at the beginning.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.460]   See how many times you can use the milk jug.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.220]   See how many times you can use that.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:43.580]   And let's teach people a little bit of an idea about that instead of creating this artificial
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:47.900]   sense of being a do-gooder that, "Oh, I put all my stuff in the blue bin."
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.540]   I get it entirely.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:59.220]   Where that's great is there's a school in Portland, Maine called Breakwater School,
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.780]   and they have just opened a tinkering lab.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:09.540]   And just like when I was a kid at the Arts and Science Center in Nashua, New Hampshire,
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.900]   it was filled with "garbage."
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:17.460]   It was all these bins and things that people were throwing away that people were giving
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:22.640]   to kids to play with and to make things out of, whether it was art or little projects
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:25.020]   or kind of Rube Goldberg machines.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:27.020]   And they're doing the same thing.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:33.180]   There's a lot of scrap that's going to use, and that's direct reuse/recycling, because
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:42.780]   it's my plastic quart yogurt cup going to mix paints in, rather than buying little paint
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.720]   stirring things that they sell at Home Depot.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.880]   It's actually better than the one that you're going to get.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:54.640]   So reusing that stuff for a completely different purpose and then giving the children the opportunity
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.140]   to look at it as something other than a yogurt cup.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.820]   What else could it be?
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.300]   Creative thinking.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.300]   Last question.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.580]   I'm ready.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.620]   Why Portland, Maine?
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:06.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.620]   J.D.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   Roth in the background.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.620]   J.D.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.620]   Roth from the other Portland.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:18.340]   I'm from Portland, Oregon.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.480]   It's actually very easy.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.400]   In no particular order.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.840]   My wife's family is in Portland, Maine, so we had been visiting and were both familiar
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.140]   with it.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.560]   My daughter was starting kindergarten, and the public schools in San Francisco at the
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:39.440]   time were very, very bad.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:44.460]   And we made a very strong effort to get into a school that we felt she'd be comfortable
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.460]   in.
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:51.800]   And we were denied our first seven choices, went back into the system, were denied the
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.560]   next seven choices.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.580]   And that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:03.160]   And then, of course, the third one was that I was saving money for a down payment for
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:09.000]   a house in San Francisco, which is pretty much a million dollars.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.200]   Without that payment, I was able to buy a house in Portland, Maine.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:18.800]   So given the opportunity of doing the right thing for my daughter to have a better environment
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.520]   to grow up in and go to school in, the second one of having a familial support and finally
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:32.200]   having Grammy around, and then the third of being able to take naps whenever I want.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   It's a pretty easy decision.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.760]   Something like a snowy day that does something for the napping makes it even better.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.160]   It also happens to be an incredibly gorgeous location.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.160]   Maine is so beautiful.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.320]   Portland is doing everything in a great way right now.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.760]   And everyone wants to come visit.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.400]   And I can put them up because I have room.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400]   So all of you listeners-
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   And you didn't have to spend a million dollars.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.400]   Sorry, I didn't have to spend.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.000]   You all come to Portland, Maine.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.640]   Bill, is there anywhere that you want to direct people to or any final closing thoughts that
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.400]   you'd like to just share with my audience as we go?
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.840]   Any closing words of advice or wisdom?
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.760]   There's nowhere in particular I want to direct people to.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.640]   I don't want to push any traffic anywhere.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.320]   People will find their own path that way.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:19.400]   I would like to tell people, as I did here last night, you actually hit the nail on the
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   head.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:26.960]   You have to figure out what enough is and then maybe take a leap.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.360]   The big one is, are you going to lie on your deathbed and think, "I should have made more.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:38.880]   I should have stayed in my job for another year to make another $20,000 when I retire.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880]   I should have..."
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.840]   No, they generally say, "I should have gone to my friend's wedding.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.200]   I should have done these fun things."
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.400]   I made the mistake of waiting much longer than I should have to retire.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.160]   I had much more money at retirement that I really needed.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.200]   That cost me several years of my life.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.840]   I'm not regretting it, but it would be nice if somebody else could hear these words since
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.080]   that's the great thing that humans can do is tell our stories to others and have them
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.520]   learn.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.160]   Consider jumping ship earlier rather than later.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.760]   I'm certainly going to be a parent who does not push my kid to make more money or get
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   a better education.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.500]   I really want her to find what's going to make her happy.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.240]   If you're not happy, you can do something about it.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.440]   It is your choice.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.700]   Financial independence or just plain old being rich doesn't change that at all.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.800]   You're still you and you've still got your things going on.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.120]   You can change them right now even if you're broke.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.900]   Thank you for sharing your story with us.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.520]   We all stand on the shoulders of giants.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.360]   You on the shoulders of your mom and now we on your shoulders.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.920]   Yeah, just slightly higher.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   A little bit.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.480]   Thank you, Bill.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.720]   There is one thing that I want you to know that happened after the interview.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.800]   The next day I was sitting and talking with Bill and we were just talking a little bit
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:05.080]   more about his story after we finished the interview.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.560]   He shared something with me that didn't come up in the context of the interview but it's
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   very common.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.320]   Obviously, it's great that he achieved financial independence.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:19.040]   The next day as he was talking, he said, "You know, I really struggled when I first became
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.240]   financially independent."
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.800]   When he first declared that financial independence, he said he struggled with depression for about
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:31.840]   two years total before he finally was able to work out his new lifestyle.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.360]   I mention that because number one, it's an important detail but it's also a common theme
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:42.000]   that I have seen among many people who have pursued financial independence and who have
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.040]   built it is once they achieve it, that transition can often be difficult.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.800]   Now this shouldn't be surprising because we know this from the research that's done on
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.580]   traditional retirees.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:00.480]   Many people who retire at traditional retirement age of 65 tend to find themselves feeling
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:06.760]   depressed, losing some of their sense of meaning and purpose of their lives.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.040]   It's not a terminal condition.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.120]   You can replace that and you can find a new sense of meaning and purpose but it's something
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.960]   that you need to be aware of.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.500]   It's very likely to happen.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.040]   Now my summary of how to handle it is very simple.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:29.840]   If you're retiring from something alone, you're probably going to face significant emotional
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.500]   and mental problems when you first start retirement.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.880]   If you're just retiring to get away from a job you hate or out of a business that you
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.160]   can't stand, you're probably going to have problems.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:48.260]   If you're retiring from something, you're going to have problems.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:52.680]   But the people that I have seen that have had the most successful retirements are those
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.520]   who are retiring to something.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:03.560]   If you're retiring to something, you're likely to have an extremely successful retirement.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.960]   The person who trades in a job that, hey, it's working fine but they'd love to be able
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:12.120]   to devote that 40 hours to something that's more important to them that may not be income
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.640]   producing, that person's ready to go.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.680]   You should have tested that, the lifestyle, partly before retiring.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.440]   Slower transitions are usually a better move.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:31.920]   But the key is, are you retiring from something or you're retiring to something?
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:37.100]   It's too important of a point for you to miss.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   Don't miss it.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.100]   Think about it carefully.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.880]   And with that, that's the end of the show today.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.260]   I want to thank Bill for coming on and sharing his experience.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.840]   Take inspiration from him.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   Fixer.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.720]   Maybe some of you don't know what that is.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.240]   Fixer just means somebody who just fixes stuff for people.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.760]   If you've got a problem, how do you get it done?
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.640]   That to me sounds like such a fun job.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.500]   And to think that somebody could build a career doing that should be inspirational to many
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   of you.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.720]   And it's something that you can do on your own terms.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   I don't know how you do it.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.440]   I think you have to have a unique set of skills.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.240]   But maybe you should put fixer on your career aspiration.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240]   That's it for today's show.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.840]   As we go, a quick reminder, I'm focusing very hard on finishing this demographic survey
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.840]   that I'm doing.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.640]   So next question, demographic survey.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.400]   If you could please take a moment and do that, you could do it right on your phone or at
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.880]   your computer, wherever you're listening to me.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.680]   Just go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.960]   Just tell me, are you a man, are you a woman, how old you are, what color you are, et cetera.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960]   That'd be super helpful.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.720]   Also, thank you to those of you who support the show as patrons.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.720]   The patron program is very important.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.880]   It allows me to not focus first and foremost on advertisers, but to focus first and foremost
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.680]   on serving you, the listening audience, who finds value and engages in a voluntary transaction
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.320]   to tell me that.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.360]   If you'd like to support the show, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.480]   Also that gets you access to Q&A calls, just like you'll hear tomorrow.

[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:16.720]   And with that, I'm out of here until tomorrow.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:24.680]   When you're in winter's favorite town, the snow-covered mountains surround you.

[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.560]   And every day brings a new adventure.
