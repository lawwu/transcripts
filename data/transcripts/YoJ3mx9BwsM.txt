[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Welcome to the BogleHedge Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.880]   This episode is hosted by the Pre and Early Retirement Life Stage Chapter and recorded
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.640]   October 13th, 2021.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.640]   It features a presentation and discussion on healthcare planning from retirement to
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.480]   Medicare, including recent law changes.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.680]   BogleHedge are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.060]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.060]   investment advice.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.000]   This is an update to a Chicago virtual group meeting that was held in February regarding
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.920]   your healthcare options from retirement until Medicare.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.640]   And it also applies to people that are self-employed, that don't have health insurance, basically
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.560]   anybody that doesn't have health insurance through an employer or a co-group.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.320]   Is how do I get insurance in this period after I leave work or if I'm self-employed?
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.440]   So a lot of people will continue their retiree insurance through their employer or union,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.920]   but that's less available than it's been in the past.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.360]   Some people will buy COBRA.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.120]   That's where you can extend the insurance you have through work.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.980]   That's whether you quit, get fired, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.600]   You can still get it, but there's an 18 month limit except for certain situations.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.460]   Many people then plan on using the Affordable Care Act, or as one of our participants tonight
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.980]   will tell you, you can also use COBRA first and then transition to ACA.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.380]   There are some people that use the ministry health plans.
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.200]   Is there anybody on the call that has used the ministry health plans or knows of anybody?
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:51.020]   If they, if you raise your hand, if you have, okay, we have one hand raised.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.540]   If you'd like to tell us about it, go ahead and unmute.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.820]   It might be a hand raised from left before.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.420]   Okay.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.220]   So some people are, you know, military veterans could possibly be available for the VA insurance.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.260]   We've had posters on the site that have talked about self-insurance, which I don't recommend.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.500]   If you're lucky enough to retire at 30 years old, you could still get a catastrophic plan
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.400]   where you don't have probably many people on this call.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.820]   Some people that are displaced workers due to trade cases, they can get a health care
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.820]   tax credit.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.780]   That's pretty rare.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.780]   No insurance.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.380]   Some people do that.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.860]   Some people move to another country.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.220]   On our Chicago call originally, somebody went to Costa Rica or something and they enjoyed
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.220]   it.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.220]   They loved it.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.660]   They loved the medical care that they got.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.220]   My favorite option, keep the spouse working and use the spouse insurance, part-time jobs
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.860]   with health insurance, self-employed.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.180]   Then in those cases, like in the state of Indiana, you have to go through the ACA unless
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.460]   you do a group plan.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.660]   And Carol, if you could speak for a second about this group plan idea.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.420]   Let me, hold on one second.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.420]   So now this is probably different in every state.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.420]   I'm in Texas.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.300]   I worked for a single lawyer that was only one lawyer and me.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.480]   And you only need, to have a group health plan, you only need a group of two, two families.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.500]   And the rates for similar plans that were on the exchange were lower for the same exact
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.140]   plan.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.420]   And so it was a really good option.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.780]   And we also had better options as far as PPOs, whereas maybe on the exchange there was just
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.780]   HMOs.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.200]   There were better options.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.980]   So just look into that.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.100]   You should be able to go to any insurance broker and they can find those plans for you.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.300]   It's just called a group health insurance plan, group plan.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.020]   And my understanding is not allowed for a husband and wife deal.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.020]   >> Right.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.100]   It has to be two unrelated family units, but, you know, family can be one person.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.420]   >> It could be you and your cousin, right?
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.580]   It could be you and your cousin, but not you and your wife or husband.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.580]   >> Or your child.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.920]   I'm not sure if an adult child would count, but for sure, yeah, for sure, yeah.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.200]   And the last option I have is enroll as a student.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.080]   Many plans, if you become a student, they want you to have health care.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.480]   So they have a group rate.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.720]   And that can often be good because students tend to be younger.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.300]   So as a group, they have less risk.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.720]   So that's an option if you want to go to school.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.840]   So some big changes happened to the ACA with the American Rescue Plan of 2021, which was
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.020]   signed by Joe Biden and the President signed it on March 11th.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.160]   It's currently only a two-year deal, but it's probably going to be extended from what I've
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.520]   heard, but we're not really supposed to speculate on those things.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.720]   It expands the subsidies to above the 400% poverty level, which really that means the
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.260]   cliff goes away, which was a real sticking point for a lot of people.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.480]   It increases the subsidies for the people that are down in the 100 to 400% poverty levels.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.960]   Those are the people who get premium tax credits and cost sharing, depending on their income.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.040]   The cliff's gone away.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.180]   Now it's an 8.5% of income max.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:27.640]   And if you had unemployment during 2021, you can get a zero premium plan, very nice plan.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.120]   There's also some unemployment issues with COBRA that we're going to talk about.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.940]   There was also many, a much larger open enrollment period.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.420]   Typically you get the plan sometime in November and you've got till about December 15th to
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.780]   decide and for January 1st coverage.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.080]   So President Biden opened the enrollment due to large unemployment and other issues, COVID.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.240]   There's also COBRA premium assistance to due to unemployment.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.680]   And as a side issue, we're going to talk a little bit about the Surprise Billing Act,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.480]   which is something we were talking about before we started recording, which is the issue of
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.720]   keeping the patient out of a billing fight between a hospital and an insurance company
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.860]   or a doctor and insurance company.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.140]   People need to know like, what are the federal poverty levels?
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.260]   And they use this as a multiplier for the income to determine your subsidies.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.940]   So it's basically the same across all 48 contiguous states.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.180]   And typically it was very important in the old days to figure out where this cliff was,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.860]   because if you made a dollar over the cliff, it could cost you a lot.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.420]   This is the, this is what the cliff actually looks like.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.300]   The blue line is the old cliff.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.640]   So this is saying that if we took a 60 year old with a benchmark silver plan, and we looked
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.180]   at their income along this bottom axis here, the X axis, and we said, if they made $15,000,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.060]   this is a single person, this is about what percent of their income they would pay.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.860]   So a $15,000 income person would pay only about, you know, 1.7% of their income towards
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.200]   health insurance.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.840]   That number would go all the way up to about 9.8%.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.900]   But right here at the magic number, if you made over 400% of the poverty level, made
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.700]   $1 over it, your cost would jump up to about 20% of your income.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.660]   So it was a huge jump in and many people, probably people on this call have managed
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.060]   their income to stay below that.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.540]   The new law is the orange curve, which limits it to 8.5% of your income.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:45.260]   So if you make 50, 60, 70, you're still only paying 8.5% of that income.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.820]   And at some point, because you've exceeded the cost of insurance, and you're making more
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.220]   and more money, it basically drops as a percentage.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:01.900]   But there is subsidies and assistance and no cliff above the 400% poverty level.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:08.280]   That was the biggest change for people who are trying to plan Roth conversions, how much
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.860]   to take out of their 401k, what to spend out of their Roth or post tax money.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.260]   So this makes it a little bit easier, because you know what the toll will be.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.480]   But the nightmare I always thought about is a person who played this very close.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.060]   And they may have gotten called in to work on New Year's Eve, which they didn't plan
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.600]   to work, and they had to work a double shift.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.580]   And they made an extra $1,000 or $500 and put them over this limit.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.900]   And that limit, that could have cost them 8 to 10,000 in premiums for working one day.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.060]   So if you have to plan this, you have to be very careful.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.660]   Has anybody in the audience had issues with this cliff that they'd like to speak about?
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.980]   You just raise your hand.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.500]   Okay, so this is only a two year deal, though.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:10.540]   So hopefully, they continue it because it does help.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.820]   So the other thing that kind of dovetails into this is the end surprise billing.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.900]   This is that health plans must cover the surprise bills.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.500]   And for the definition of a surprise bill, I'll give you an example.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:30.340]   My wife went for a procedure, and the anesthesiologist, unknown to her, was not in the network.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.860]   So she went to a network hospital with a network surgeon, a network pathologist, and network
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   nurses, network janitors, everything.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.340]   And she gets a bill at the end for about 10 times what you'd expect.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.540]   And the reason is, is the anesthesiologist is not in the network.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.800]   Typically in those cases, if you had a plan without a network coverage, it would possibly
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.660]   pay for it, maybe with a higher deductible, less reimbursement.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:04.940]   But in certain states like our state of Indiana, there is absolutely no non-network coverage
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.580]   at all in any of the ACA plans.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.540]   So if you're dying in the hospital, and for emergency care, it's covered, but the minute
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.100]   you're patched up, you want them to drag you to a network hospital.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.580]   But in this case, with the surprise billing, if this anesthesiologist were to submit a
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.420]   $2,000 bill, they would normally be reimbursed at, let's say, $110.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.940]   And that's what those rates are, because I've looked at them, and they're typically 10 to
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.940]   20 times the amount that the insurance would reimburse.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:43.120]   So what happens is, this now gets, they take the patient out of this, and the insurance
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.460]   company and the provider have to fight it out.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:52.960]   And there's different strategies they talked about, but they settled on a arbitration thing.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.140]   And it should take the patient out of the billing fight.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.180]   But they're still arguing about some of the regulations that have come out, and we'll
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.740]   see how that goes.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:08.060]   So if you have a surgery that could be done on December 31st or January 1st, for this
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:13.740]   issue alone, I'd make it January 1st.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.580]   This is how the premium, this is the difference between the old law and the new law.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.620]   So this is the subsidies here.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.660]   And you can see the subsidies have come down in certain areas, especially in the lower
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.300]   incomes.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.260]   Okay, the other thing that everyone should be aware of is that you eventually want to
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.220]   get and survive through this ACA plans to get to Medicare.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.180]   And there's some certain rules, I'm no expert on Medicare, but you'd need to work at least
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.440]   10 years of paid Medicare taxes.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.060]   If you don't have that, let's say you started in the workforce very late, I would recommend
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.700]   you make sure you work enough to get to Medicare, have enough years, 40 quarters or 10 years
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.860]   of payment.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.720]   You're eligible at 65.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.640]   And you're also eligible if you've been on social security disability.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.820]   And the other caveat is there's a thing called Irma charges.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.500]   And that would be, I think, people are familiar with it.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.540]   I think it's a look back two years.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.140]   And if you've made a lot of money, your Medicare premiums go up.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.100]   Anybody want to speak about that?
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.420]   Okay.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:39.020]   So, on the site, if you look at the blog, you'll see a lot of some cases about health
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.020]   ministry plans.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.280]   I did personally talk to somebody who thought it was the greatest thing and he just wasn't
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.340]   available for the call.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.860]   You may not always get in, they are not legally required to pay.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.700]   The people who have them seem to love them.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.700]   But my theory is if you have a lot of assets, you don't want to use something like this
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.640]   because you're the backstop.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:08.380]   So the person I talked to said it saves them about $1,000 a month over the ACA plan.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.940]   Self-insure, you know, even before COVID, it was insane.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.340]   But if you think about people who have been in the ICU for three months, it costs, you
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.620]   know, $15 million or something.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.180]   It would be very difficult to self-insure.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.500]   The risk is just too high, I think, especially as you approach, you know, retirement ages.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.180]   And you also have to decide, do you, I would, I would prefer to self-insure my home any
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.300]   day of the week before I did health insurance.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   Okay.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.260]   We're going to talk about COBRA now and I'm going to bring Lady Geek in and she can talk
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.980]   a little bit about COBRA because she used it and maybe you could explain how the process
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.980]   went for you.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   Oh boy.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.620]   Well, it did, the process went fine.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.140]   The process ended fine.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.860]   I am now uninsured until I get on my ACA plan, November 1st.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.740]   COBRA was an interesting thing.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.540]   Well, for, well, you have your, your slide here saying it's a Consolidated Omnibus Budget
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.820]   Reconciliation Act.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.180]   Basically, if nothing else, you lose your job.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.180]   You have medical insurance.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:21.900]   Back when I was thinking about to retire, I went on leave of absence without pay.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:27.620]   And because I was thinking it was a COVID thing and I just, I just became a widow.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.860]   So I was, I had a lot of stress going on.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.540]   So, and I said, I got to retire.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.660]   So what I did, I decided to do a test run and take 30 days leave without pay.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:43.720]   That was a mistake because when I did that, they dropped all my benefits.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.260]   As an employee, when you do leave without paying, I Googled it and it's perfectly fine.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.660]   You drop all benefits, all medical, all life insurance, all benefits are dropped when you
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.900]   do that.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.820]   And the only reason I had medical insurance was due to COBRA because it was a loss of
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.860]   employment.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.860]   So I said, okay, I'm not coming back.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.740]   And so that's how I became involved with COBRA.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.420]   And what I did is I went on, I have, I have a medical insurance broker.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.060]   And I said, Hey, Hey Gaia, what's should I go on ACA on COBRA?
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.760]   It was without hesitation.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.660]   He said, stay on COBRA.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.660]   Why?
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.520]   Because they do COBRA, the employer, your employer's insurance, they are your premiums
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.000]   based on the average age of the workforce.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.160]   If the average age of the workforce is like 35, the premium is one hell of a lot lower
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.320]   than it is if you're at 62 or 60.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.020]   So for me, even if you, if I pay full freight, that's for me in Philadelphia, actually close
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.500]   enough to Philadelphia.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.900]   And I would say I'm saving almost half, I guess other people I've heard COBRA is way
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.900]   more expensive.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:57.940]   So, but for me, like 60% was I was paying only 60%, even at full, full, full price plus
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.540]   2% admin fee.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.780]   So I, and COBRA is, you continue the benefits, no change, you don't change your plan.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.180]   You just continue that on for 18 months.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:13.360]   So I mean, I was doing, oh, one thing with COBRA, if you miss a payment, your coverage
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   is dropped.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   Bye bye.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   See you later.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.840]   And the other thing, when I was talking with my employer about the timing of your premium
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.200]   payments, here's something interesting that I didn't know about the employer side, when
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   they have this, the website, the company website, where they set it up, and they said, okay,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.160]   just do automatic billing, pay it the first month, you're fine.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.800]   And I spoke with the rep, she says, you don't want to do that.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   Why?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.920]   And I've heard this with other companies.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.360]   If you send your send the company your money the first, they don't pay the insurance company
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.800]   until a week later, you are not covered for that first week of the month.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   Really?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   Yes.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.960]   So be very careful if you want to go on COBRA, and you want to spend the way and your company
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.080]   website says automatic payments, don't do that.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.540]   I was paying my monthly bill the day the billing came out, which is like on the 15th, a couple
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.540]   weeks early.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.480]   So I made sure to do a quick reminder, even got a mail notification made sure I pay my
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.920]   premium two weeks before the first of the month.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:21.420]   And so I say that, I just that just from I didn't mention that in the in my discussion
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.980]   threads or anything, but that is a very important point.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.600]   For COBRA premiums, make sure that the insurance company gets paid at the first month, not
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.800]   when you pay your employer, because there's a there was a week delay, there's a holy crap.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.440]   Let me let me just share my screen here.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.360]   Or, Jim, I'm going to stop yours.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   Okay.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   And where am I?
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   Sir?
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   You plan?
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360]   Yeah, I stopped mine.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   Okay.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   You plan details.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.880]   Share this guy.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.840]   Because what I was doing, whoops, I can see it because what I was doing, I want to show
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:01.160]   the discussion threads that um, let me let me put the links and I have a couple of I'll
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.480]   just dump all the definitions I work in.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   Meeting.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480]   Come on.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   Oh, I can't I can't.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.840]   I'll share links and since I stopped sharing the screen of this thread, this is someone
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:23.000]   just sent me sent the chat this this explains when COBRA Okay, so okay, go through COBRA.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.280]   I go through First of all, I called the company HR.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.640]   When does my coverage and it's at the end of the year?
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.000]   No, no, no, that's not right.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.160]   The people who are the plan administrators don't understand it.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:39.440]   I went with the administrator who does the insurance claims processing is Blue Cross
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   Blue Shield.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.880]   I went with the company's administrator handles the claims they have to pay.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.880]   They know the rules.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.880]   They confirmed.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.200]   Yes, of course, your coverage ends on October 6.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.280]   I going to check the website yesterday, I'm still active.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   Who knows?
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.560]   I'm not I'm not saying anything.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.680]   So I'm just gonna let it go.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:03.800]   But what I wanted to say was, my plan ended up my coverage ended October 6.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:09.000]   I go to my my medical insurance broker, sign me up October 6, he goes, I can't do that.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.720]   Why not?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.920]   Because no ACA plan starts on an arbitrary day, they all start at the first of the month
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.880]   and there's something called a 15th of the month rule, a what 15th of the month.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.000]   If you end end coverage, I have it here 15th of the month.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.440]   You can you start on the first of the next month, if I stopped my cover coverage on the
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   16th, I would not be covered for until December.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   That's right.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   Yes.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   Now.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.800]   So I'm in this I'm in this gap right now.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.640]   And so what I was doing was kicking out some discussions that if, guys, if you if people
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.200]   are thinking of retirement, this is an important decision.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.280]   This is an important reason on how a fact on how you want to set set your date.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.320]   Oh, there's some cookie here.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   Okay.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:06.900]   But what the only other thing is, there was a change in on the on the federal website
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.760]   that it's, of course, not for me, starting next year, they're going to get rid of the
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.120]   15th of the month rule.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:21.000]   So I have in this thread, in this post, I'm quoting the the website that I can't see what
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   that is.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.640]   So this I think this problem is going to go away.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.640]   But there's some exceptions.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.640]   Just be careful.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.320]   But no, no, it may it may go away.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.400]   Because Pennsylvania is a state run marketplace that follows the AC, but they don't have to.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.160]   So this federal marketplace rule may not apply to your state.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.000]   So they give it a shot, but be aware of this.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.400]   Okay, so that that's, I want to say, here's all the details on this is what I was trying
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   to do about pay.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:21:01.520]   Oh, the other thing that I mentioned, a nice surprise was that the I mentioned in this
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:10.880]   discussion that I was I got I got denied for a pre just so in the ACA plans have to cover
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   pre existing conditions.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.320]   I was saying pre existing condition, cancer, heart, you know, all the all the big the IBDs,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.040]   whatever the big stuff.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:27.160]   No, I got denied oil, the my insurance broker trying to get a something to fill the gap.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:34.400]   So we applied and got denied to why for a minor very minor condition that I'm on a small
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.360]   generic drug for.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:42.680]   And I'm because it's not an ACA plan there within their rights and have denied me coverage.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.840]   I'm not I do not qualify for a metal coverage right now.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.880]   So what my insurance broker did, oh, and then I told my doctor, he was shocked.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.800]   There are hundreds of conditions that you can be denied for when I was searching this
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.200]   but my let me put this way, the condition is my doctor didn't believe me.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.400]   So I showed him the letter where OK.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.200]   So that's where it goes.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.080]   So I was getting here.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.760]   OK, so so that's that's this in a nutshell, what the only thing I could get was some kind
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.360]   of hospital indemnity plan that it's not medical insurance.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:25.480]   It's meant for covering if you have problems with the medical expenses, it's just some
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.600]   some insurance that covers people like who have already it's not the right insurance
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   for me.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.160]   It's the only thing I could get and I'm going to cancel it in 30 days, November 1st.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.920]   So it's like 100 some dollars, but it's better than nothing, maybe, but they haven't charged
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   me yet.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.560]   And by the way, this this this policy also has a 30 day review where I can cancel for
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.520]   any reason within 30 days.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:54.680]   So if I don't use it and he shouldn't have sold it to me anyway, but anyway, so so there's
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.320]   a lot of things going on with insurance here.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   So that's this one.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.440]   And then I just I wanted to link to insurance.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.080]   This is my this is my original discussion where I was this is this is about believe
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.480]   without pay.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.760]   And this is this is my start on April 2020.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.900]   This is where I started this whole process.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.720]   So I'll put the links up as soon as I stop sharing the screen.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   What I did here.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.640]   Oh, this is another link, because when I go into the marketplace, there's something on
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.640]   EPO, HMO and PPO.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.240]   I refuse to do an HMO because you need referrals.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.000]   I have nothing but bad experience and I have a luxury that Blue Cross I don't I do not
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.240]   need to have an HMO plan.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.760]   So that was my key requirements, either EPO or PPO for me.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.600]   Oh, I just also wanted to show just show you, I probably can't share it because it was sent
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.780]   by my broker.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.880]   This is a real live rate sheet of Keystone Blue Cross for Philadelphia, because I want
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.160]   to show you that because people are wondering, like, you hear all this stuff, but here, here,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.120]   there's nothing like live data.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.040]   So if say, because I want to show you the difference in the premium rate.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.560]   So if say, if you're like 30 years old, take this top plan, 650 non tobacco, OK, let's
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.900]   go to 60.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900]   So $650.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:18.520]   And if I go down to 60, that same plant is 1554.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.920]   So I want to show you, yes, this is why I stayed with Cobra, because my company's average
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   premium was down in the eight, no, the average age was down in 30s, and I'm 60.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.420]   So if I went to buy this in the marketplace, it will cost me $1,500.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:38.920]   So this is why you need to pay attention and compare and ask your company, what is my Cobra
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   cost?
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.680]   Then you go and shop the plan and see if it if it makes a difference.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.200]   So this is why I stayed on Cobra.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.260]   What I'm doing now is I'm going on in the Pennsylvania marketplace.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.800]   And I just want to know and what I already entered in and all this is a Philadelphia
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.240]   zip code and I enter arbitrary birthday.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.120]   But this is where the tax subsidy comes in tax.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.080]   So I just put in an arbitrary number, just to show you that here are the plan details.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.760]   This is the market.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:18.640]   So here HMO, EPO, or PPO, gold, platinum, whatever, blue cross, blue cross.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.800]   So here's here's the EPO for 350.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.300]   What income did you put in, lady?
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.800]   I put in 10,000.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.960]   Just to get something up there, I could put 50,000 just watch these premiums.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.760]   But when I work, but the thing that the thing is that this is where my here's the here's
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.880]   here's is for $600 a month.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.720]   So this is a subsidized Yeah, deductible out of pocket math.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.800]   So this is $600 a month.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:53.440]   So 12 times six is $7,200 a year versus this, but say with my tax credit, I'm paying $11
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:59.480]   a month versus $500 a month for this EPO plan.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.400]   So they say that's that.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:09.320]   So that that's so I say I'm taking a GAM right now for for 2022 and starting November 1,
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:16.760]   I am taking gamble with my tax subsidy that I'm going to I'm going to spend when way less
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.320]   than like six or $7,000.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.040]   So I'm just taking gamble the max this is going to cost me $7,000 because this is an
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   $8,000 deductible.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.660]   Like I got one for 7,000 here it is.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.760]   And then independence is at the Blue Cross Blue Shield franchise in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   Okay.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.800]   So yeah, so this deductible seats out of pocket and yeah, it's EPO, they see the deductible
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.080]   an hour pot deductible 7000.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.720]   That's because there is no coinsurance, there's no copay, you just pay all things you I'm
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.560]   seeing you pay the in network rates.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.600]   So that everybody should note the HSA plans that are available.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.300]   If you go to the next plan to the right, there's no HSA on that plan, because it's got benefits
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.600]   before the deductible.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.560]   Yeah, see.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.440]   So so yeah, so that this is the so yeah, so that the these are HSA plans.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.520]   So I, but actually, okay, so that's this, that that's, let's want to show up, I'll dump
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.880]   the links in the chat for what for my discussion stuff.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.800]   So that's all I wanted to show.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:27.240]   I don't think I can share this because it was sent by the broker to me not intended.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:34.140]   Unless you can find Keystone ACA rate sheet on Google, I really probably can't share that.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.460]   But I just want to show you how much the premiums, they are significant based on your age significant
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.460]   change.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.020]   So let me stop sharing.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.220]   And remind me to cut that out of the video, because we don't know.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:54.580]   I don't know, I probably keep I just didn't want to pass a copy around, pass a copy around.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.860]   But that is also because it by the way, insurance rates vary by county.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.260]   So plans, everything goes by county.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.780]   That's why they want your zip code.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.620]   But then again, I had a question on that.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.040]   On the ACA plans, I've never had one before.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.700]   When you sign up, you need a you need to show proof of income in Pennsylvania's household
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.400]   income, not adjusted gross income.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.180]   But how do they know for 2022 what I'm doing?
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.260]   I assume there's a tax form, there's a marketplace tax because I know they have to adjust my
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.900]   premium for next year.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.780]   You give them the estimate of the thing.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.780]   And then there's a tax.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.220]   Well, I forget the form, I have it in the presentation that you would true it up on
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.720]   your tax return.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.700]   It turns out this year, this year for people who underestimated their income, but then
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.520]   went on unemployment, they don't even have to pay that back.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.980]   So somebody asked about whether you should work or take a leave of absence.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.660]   It seems like this year, if you can get on unemployment, it's the best thing to do.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.660]   Okay.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.660]   Okay.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.500]   So yeah, it's something during your presentation, if you say like, well, how is my first year
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.500]   in ACA?
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.500]   How do I adjust?
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.700]   How's how's my premium adjusted for next year?
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   So I'll know how to
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.080]   Well, you just estimate your own income, your Maggie, really.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.620]   But the issue is, that will then give you an immediate premium tax credit, that will
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.140]   be a lower bill.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.860]   Some people do it the opposite way, where they say, just let me have the bill, and I'll
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.860]   pay it.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.900]   And then I'll true it up on my my tax return at the end.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.980]   So this true up is done in the ACA website or on your now on your tax return.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.700]   That's where I want to know what form and stuff.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.700]   Okay.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.700]   Yeah, we have a screenshot.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.700]   I don't remember the number.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   Okay.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.900]   I just don't the links of my discussion threads and the definition.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.700]   Okay, I'm going to share my screen now again.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.860]   Yeah, I'm done.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.860]   But I want to turn it over to Carol for a second, because she has an answer on the Medicare
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.060]   question that came up in the chat.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.980]   Somebody asked about a non working spouse.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.620]   Carol, if you'd like to speak.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.740]   Yeah, yeah, I was searching while you know, during the presentation, I found a pretty
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.740]   good article.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.620]   Let me post the link again about the kind of explains about the 40 quarters.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.060]   And there are some options if you don't have the 40 quarters.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:17.580]   If your spouse similar to the way Social Security works, you can qualify on a spouse's record.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.960]   But you still you still can't get Medicare until 65.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:25.100]   And your spouse that has worked the 40 quarters have to be at least 62.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.500]   And luckily, I didn't even know this till just now either.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.380]   It's not an all or nothing thing that the 40 credits quarters is just to get the free
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:38.580]   part premium free Part A. And it sounds like it's a little bit here, I'm going to post
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.620]   something right in the chat here.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:51.560]   If you work between 30 and 39 quarters, you just you're going to be paying 259 a month.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:57.860]   So it is a huge, you know, it's a pretty big price jump, but it's not totally off the table.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.240]   And then less than 30 quarters, it's 471 a month.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.620]   So it does go up a lot.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.020]   But you're not totally cut out of it if you haven't worked the 40 quarters, but it's definitely
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.020]   worth it.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:13.140]   You know, if you're close, you definitely want to try to get your 40 quarters in.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:20.060]   But that's a really good article that explains everything that I posted in the chat.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.700]   Okay, back to Jim.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:30.340]   Oh, go ahead, go ahead, Miriam.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.180]   You're muted, unmute yourself.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.620]   I have two things.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:42.900]   First of all, I believe on the Boglehead forum, I read one of the Bogleheads mentioned he
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:49.060]   lived in California, and he worked for the university system, that when his Cobra ended
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:56.580]   at 18 months, he had the state of California would extend the Cobra for another, I think
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.380]   it was six months.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.820]   I'm not.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.060]   I'm pretty sure that's what I read.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.220]   This was several years ago.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:08.060]   I don't know if that's true, but maybe some states or some, well, I guess it would be
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.420]   states, maybe some employers will extend the Cobra.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.740]   I don't know if anybody knows about that.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.140]   Miriam, I can actually speak to that.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.860]   Like I was saying earlier, I used to work for, I was a paralegal for just a single attorney.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.940]   And so obviously, the Cobra rules didn't apply, because I think it's you have to have 15 employees.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:31.260]   But there was something called Texas State continuation coverage, which worked a lot
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.740]   like Cobra, except it was only nine months, but still, hey, that's a lot better than,
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.420]   so I was able to get the better, cheaper plan for an additional nine months.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:44.620]   And it was kind of funny how it worked, whereas I had 60 days to decide.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.980]   And then, let's see, I worked till the end of January, then I have 60 days to make my
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   decision.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.860]   And then the nine months started from the end of the 60 days.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.700]   So really, it was 11 months.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.340]   You got to kind of look into those little rules and extend it as much as you can.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.700]   So that's going to be state by state rules on that one, though.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:10.940]   And then I also wondered whether anybody had made claims under Cobra, and they found it
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:19.940]   difficult to be paid for Cobra insurance to pay their claims.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.940]   I never had a problem.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:26.020]   I mean, because it's just, I say, with Blue Cross, you go direct.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.380]   It's just how the claims get paid, how the premiums get paid.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.500]   Everything else is handled direct with the insurance.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.860]   Your company has nothing to do with it after they pay.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.460]   It's the claims administrators and the usual stuff.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.460]   Okay.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.460]   Thank you.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.740]   Cheryl, you want to go ahead?
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.740]   Go ahead.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:48.940]   Yeah, I was going back to talking about extending beyond 18 months.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:55.140]   My husband's an air transport pilot, so he's forced to retire at age 65, and I am younger
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.500]   than he is, and I need more than 18 months' worth of coverage.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:05.780]   So I have to finalize the answer on this, but my understanding is that with other pilots,
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:11.260]   since it is a situation of forced retirement, it's a condition of employment for all air
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.540]   transport pilots that carry passengers.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.340]   Since that's a forced condition of retirement, as opposed to simply choosing to retire, that
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.700]   we also have the opportunity to have Cobra for longer because of that.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:29.380]   But I need to confirm it, and we'll post it on the form.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.860]   Okay.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   Thank you.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.860]   There was some extensions on Cobra.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.540]   It could go as much as 36 months that I had read about, but there are special circumstances.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:44.140]   But I would like to just repeat that you have up to 60 days to activate this Cobra, so you
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.960]   could be terminated from your employment or quit.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.060]   You could have a heart attack the minute you cross over the parking lot, and you could
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.900]   decide a week later that you want to get this Cobra coverage.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:01.460]   So you do have to pay your bills, as Lady Geek said, but you have 60 days retroactively
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.100]   to choose Cobra.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.500]   And the other thing that's important is you need to know what the employer's paying because
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.000]   you're going to pay a slight 2% administration charge over it.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.060]   Most people don't understand that their employers are paying maybe up to 80% of the cost.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:22.060]   So when it comes to you, it could be five times the amount or four times the amount
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.740]   that they're taking out of your check as your contribution.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.780]   All right.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.860]   So let's keep going here.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:34.540]   So Cobra had some effects, or the American Rescue Plan affected it.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.780]   They have a big premium assistance.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:43.980]   And did this affect you, Lady Geek, as far as the premium assistance on Cobra?
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.200]   No, because I start April 2020.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.900]   I don't know if I will qualify.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.780]   I was already retired.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.300]   When did you complete Cobra?
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   Just recently, right?
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   October 6th.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   Yeah, you should look into that.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   That might help you.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   Well, it's already done.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.380]   I don't know if you can do it retroactively.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.380]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.620]   I don't know.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.340]   So again, this could be even reduction of hours.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.340]   It doesn't have to be termination.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   Okay.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.340]   Let me put it this way.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.380]   I'd rather not deal with my employer at this point.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.380]   Okay.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.380]   All right.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.980]   So again, unemployment provisions, if you were unemployed at any time in 2021, it treats
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:27.100]   it as if you had 133% of the federal poverty level, which is the maximum subsidies.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:32.780]   So the only issue there is this thing called the family glitch, which is when your spouse
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:38.100]   has maybe doesn't have insurance because they turned it down because it was coming through
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.100]   you.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.660]   But if they are eligible for employer-sponsored insurance, then you don't get a subsidy.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:50.740]   So again, if you had any, even a week of unemployment in 2021, and you're on ACA, you're going to
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:57.500]   have a very nice low premium and it will affect and help your COBRA.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.740]   As we talked about, I don't know if people are familiar with health savings accounts.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:09.360]   If the health savings or the insurance policy is eligible for a health savings account,
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.300]   you can put money into that.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:17.060]   The 2021 limits were 3,600 individuals, 72 family, and then a catch-up provision for
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.460]   55 and older.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.980]   And this money is tax-free, and it's tax-free when you spend it.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.980]   And you can spend it on deductibles.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.380]   I think you can spend it on Medicare Advantage programs.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.600]   You can some over-the-counter items.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:39.420]   Has anybody used their HSA a lot and would like to speak about it?
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   This is Lady Eek.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.740]   I just started last year, and I said I qualified medical expenses.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:51.380]   I zeroed mine out with one month's nursing home, skilled nursing facility for my late
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.820]   husband.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.820]   So the idea is, if you have to keep a record of your qualified medical expenses rather
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:04.140]   than keeping an entire pack of stuff, I just said, "Here's one month from a nursing home."
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.140]   And that zeroed out.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.900]   Actually, I have five cents left in the account because I forgot to close it out properly,
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.460]   but I might restart it.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:16.260]   What does a month, if you don't mind me asking, what does a month of nursing home cost these
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.260]   days?
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.260]   $408 a day.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.260]   Wow.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.260]   Okay.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   The $10,000 to $12,000 per month.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:30.020]   And at the time, I was prepared to burn down his IRA for that, and it's called self-insuring.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.700]   But we're diverting from medical.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:39.500]   But yeah, so skilled nursing and anything that's a qualified medical expense.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:45.300]   So a lot of people use HSAs for, they have like a debit card and you just go to the pharmacy
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.860]   and it'll tell you yes or no, if you can use the card for it.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.220]   So a lot of people do it for that.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.220]   Okay.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   Thank you.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.780]   So the key thing is not all plans are eligible.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.580]   So as Lady Geek showed on the Philadelphia or the Pennsylvania site, certain plans, depending
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:07.300]   on their deductible range and whether they start providing benefits before the deductibles
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   reach.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.980]   $8,000 pays, you're not going to be an HSA plan.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.860]   So these tend to be high deductible plans, but in the state of Indiana, we have cases
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:23.620]   where the deductibles are so high, they exceed the limit, which is a typical government bureaucracy
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.940]   issue that doesn't make any sense.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:32.920]   You could have a plan with an $8,000 deductible with a $7,000 limit, and you're not, you can't
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.700]   save with an HSA, but that's a different issue.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:44.100]   So again, it has to be at least 1,400 for an individual, but it can't be more than $7,050
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.900]   or 14 for a family.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.820]   And it can't have anything other than preventative care.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.880]   So your annual checkups, things like that are covered mammograms, things like that.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.640]   But if they say they're going to give you a $20 copay, it's over.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.080]   And in Indiana, we had 39 plans available and only three were HSA compatible.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.980]   And most of them were because of the 7,000 deductible was way exceeded.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:12.980]   It was in the eights or something.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.180]   So these are not like flexible spending plans.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.220]   This is your money, and you can decide when you want to pay for it.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.380]   As Lady Geek said, you could pay it for nursing home at the end.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.420]   You could pay it for aspirin today if you wanted to.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.540]   And as Lady Geek mentioned, there's debit cards and all sorts of ways to pay.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:37.340]   I heard you can even buy stuff off on Amazon and use your HSA.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.860]   These are a couple plans that I looked at, and this is just to get an idea of, you know,
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.260]   what had an HSA and what were the premiums.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.540]   This is this year, and it reflects the America Rescue Act.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:57.340]   And it shows you $25,000 income, 50, 100, and what the ranges are.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:03.080]   So this is for a male and a female, non-smoker, 60 and 60 years old.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:09.100]   I just picked that arbitrarily, but you can see the range here that at a $25,000 income,
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.220]   you could be paying $52 a month in Illinois.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:17.400]   Or if you want the Blue Cross Blue Shield preferred silver PPO plan, you could be paying
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:26.600]   $1,500 a month with a $6,000 deductible and a $17,000 family out of pocket.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:32.700]   So it pays to shop around and decide what your risks are for your health and how much
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.200]   your income is.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.020]   Now we're going to go back to the basic ACA Act that was passed under Obama.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:47.260]   And that is that they did things like eliminated cancelization by the insurance companies.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:54.320]   They had a lot of subsidy levels between 138% of the federal poverty level.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.960]   Now here's a case where let's say I had a million dollars in a 401k, a million dollars
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:07.360]   in a Roth, and I had a million dollars underneath the mattress that was post-tax money, legal.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.760]   At that point, I could spend money just out of the mattress money and technically have
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.440]   no income.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:21.160]   In those cases, I would be below the 138% and I would have to go on Medicare, which
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.480]   would mean I might be subject to asset tests, which I wouldn't pass.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:31.200]   So you basically would like to, if you had no income from wages, interest, dividends,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.960]   things like that, you would basically like to take money out of your 401k to get up to
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.880]   the 138% of poverty level to qualify for the ACA plans.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.640]   And at that point, you'd also get a major subsidy.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   But you do need to be at least at 138% of the federal poverty level.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:43:00.800]   This is the rule that allowed people to stay on their parents' policies until they're 26.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.920]   It required employers to cover workers if they had enough employees.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.760]   So it was the basic ACA act of, I forget what year it was actually.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.400]   So there's no coverage limits in the ACA.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.440]   It used to be they could set a limit of like $2 million.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.640]   But some people could reach those limits.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.080]   They could cancel you.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   Now they can still cancel you for fraud.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.120]   So that's the only reason, nonpayment and fraud.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:33.240]   And as Lady Geek pointed out on the Cobra, you want to make sure you pay it.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.480]   I think people know what deductibles and co-pays are.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.040]   Deductible is what you're going to be paying first.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.160]   The co-pays, you go to the doctor and they say it's a $30 co-pay.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.520]   You'll be paying that.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.880]   And then some of them have coinsurance up to limits.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:53.080]   And each of the plans that you have under the ACA will have a benefit coverage limit.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.640]   I think I have a page here.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.920]   And you'll see a page that looks like this.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.960]   And this will tell you what's covered, what isn't.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.440]   Some of these plans might have vision and dental, and they can be very expensive.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:11.200]   But you'll find out what it covers.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   This is the typical open enrollment.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.560]   It typically happens November 1st through December 15th.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.880]   You want to purchase insurance by December 15th for coverage on the first of the year.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.280]   They've been extended greatly this year because of COVID.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.320]   And the other thing that happens is if you have a qualifying event, which would mean
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:34.480]   you got married, you had a baby, adopted somebody, placed the child in foster care, got divorced,
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   a spouse passed away, you moved to a new zip code, or you lost your insurance for whatever
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   reason.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.520]   Could be that you came off a Medicaid because you had too much income now.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.440]   So these open enrollments periods weren't part of the ACA or the Recovery Act.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:56.500]   They were actually executive order by President Biden to get people to sign up.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.340]   And there's a new 80/20 rule.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.000]   Some of you may have received credits back from your insurance company because they didn't
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.420]   spend enough money.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:09.680]   They need to spend 80% of their money on medical care.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.080]   And if they don't, they have to rebate that money to their customers.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.820]   This is a typical benefit plan page.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:23.320]   You get this on -- if you go to the healthcare.gov and look up your state and look at a plan,
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.160]   you'll see this.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.120]   This is what we were talking about earlier, about whether you need referrals.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.960]   If you go to an HMO, with an HMO, you're typically assigned a doctor, and that doctor makes all
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.000]   the medical decisions for you.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.180]   I'm just afraid -- I don't know if this is for effect -- that they might have some financial
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.920]   incentive of not referring you.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.640]   So that's why a lot of people don't like HMOs.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.040]   Is anybody on here that has an HMO and likes it?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.320]   Just raise your hand if you do.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.720]   I don't see anybody yet.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.440]   Okay.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.840]   Now one of the things that happens with the silver plans is there's extra cross-saving
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:06.360]   sharing reductions that really can lower those plan costs.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.080]   So typically, if you're in the lower income or you're planning your income to be low -- for
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:17.320]   example, in my case, if you were to say a million in a Roth, a million in a 401(k) and
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:22.560]   a million under the mattress, I could plan my income, theoretically, to be in the perfect
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.920]   spot to get the maximum subsidy.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.320]   And if we went back to that cliff curve, we would see that we really want to just barely
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.400]   make it into -- we'd really want to be here in this 138%.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   Some states, it could be 100.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.440]   I think it's got to do with Medicare expansion.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:46.440]   But for two people, it would be 23.8, and I don't know if this is 2021.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.280]   Some states have their own exchanges, and there's a list here.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.560]   So if you live, for example, in Maryland, you would go, just like Lady Geek did, to
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:47:01.680]   a private exchange for the state that the state runs, but all the other states use healthcare.gov.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.440]   And this is how you view a plan.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   So let's do that now.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:24.800]   Okay.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:35.360]   So let's pretend we live in -- we'll say we live in Illinois, and I'm going to put a zip
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.360]   code in.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.880]   I'm going to say Chicago.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.320]   And I'll pick the county.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.680]   It's Cook County.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:50.720]   And first thing I'm going to do is say -- let's say it's just for me.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.480]   And I'm going to say I'm 60 years old here, and I'm a male, and I don't smoke or use tobacco
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.360]   and things like that.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.280]   And I don't have a spouse, let's say.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.400]   And let's say I have that income of -- I'm just going to put $25,000 in here.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.120]   And here's an important question.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.040]   Did I get unemployment in 2021?
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.320]   I'll say no for now, and I'll look at the plans here.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:21.520]   And they're basically telling me that I'm going to get $694 of assistance on my premium.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.720]   So I'll go view the plans, and you guys can all do this.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.680]   And I'm going to add some filters, because just to narrow it down, I'm just going to
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.040]   look at the silver plans.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.760]   This is where you get the most subsidies at these levels.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.240]   If you're higher income and very healthy, I would definitely look at the bronze plans
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.940]   here.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.640]   And if you notice here, there's some filters.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.120]   So if I wanted to be in Blue Cross Blue Shield, if that was important to me, I could filter
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.120]   by this too.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.680]   I could make sure that it has an HSA.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.120]   It may turn out there are none.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.400]   So I'm just going to apply these filters.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.800]   And you can see that the cheapest plan I could get is $21 from this Bright Healthcare, which
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.240]   I've never heard of.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.160]   And the deductible is $1,528.50 on the out-of-pocket.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:14.320]   And it tells you co-insurance, generic drugs, specialists, things like that.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.740]   It includes child dental, but no adult dental.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:21.640]   And if I scroll down here, you can see the numbers that go up.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:28.820]   And there's three pages here.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:33.280]   And the most expensive plan is $495.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.840]   And that was really because of the income was so low.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.840]   Okay.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.640]   And this is Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   And also you'd be looking at the other thing you'd be looking at is this is a PPO plan.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.280]   So that's why the cost is so high, where that first plan I'm sure was an HMO plan.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.640]   So if I go back to the top now, and if you were planning your income and deciding how
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.280]   much to take out of your 401(k) or do Roth conversions, you would want to do something
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   like this.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.540]   So I'm going to edit this now.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:10.680]   And let's say instead of making $25,000, I'm going to do Roth conversions.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.440]   And I decide to convert up to $150,000 or something like that.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.720]   So I'm going to change this number to $150,000.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:25.640]   Now this income is high enough that that 8.5% rule is not going to really play into it.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.960]   So I'm going to see the real cost here, I'm sure.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:35.840]   And basically, it says I don't have any subsidies here because I'm because of my income, I decided
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.320]   to convert Roth, do Roth conversions.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.000]   And now this is the cheapest plan.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.720]   And I want to actually what the easiest way to do this, I want to stick with Blue Cross
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.640]   Blue Shield for a second.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:55.360]   And I'm going to say just show me these.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.520]   And you can see that this is for a single person.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.440]   So this is pretty good, pretty high.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:11.640]   We're talking $1,300 a person here, 60 years old with 150,000 in income in Illinois, but
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.600]   you're getting a gold PPO plan.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   Again, if you want to the cheapest plan, I'm sorry, let me go back down here.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:34.120]   I think it was what $500 I thought oh, that's it right there that page sorry.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.880]   So we're talking 569 Okay, so go to healthcare.gov.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.240]   It's got lots of good information.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.680]   And the other site is brought up by firefighter in the chat.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:47.200]   The Kaiser Foundation has excellent papers, calculators, everything.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   So you can do that.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.960]   So if you want to plan your income.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:54.080]   Now remember, in the second example, I went to 150,000.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:01.200]   The maximum I'm going to pay for my health care is eight and a half percent.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:07.080]   But that's, that's for the cheapest silver plans.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:12.760]   And I'm going to the my Roth conversions really brought my income up.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.880]   So in you have to decide whether you think future taxes are going to be worth those Roth
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.100]   and Roth percentages against these premiums.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.280]   I don't think it's worth it.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:29.120]   But you have to figure that out for yourself.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:47.880]   Okay, so let's Alright, let's
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.840]   So as we talked about, you have to estimate your income.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.560]   There are differences between the Aggie and the Maggie and what those are things that
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:03.480]   like if you had income from tax free municipal bonds, those numbers get bad added back in,
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:08.080]   and it's kind of like, it's a bigger number than your than your AGI.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.140]   The next thing is, how would you optimize your so your Maggie income?
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.520]   One of the things to think about is if you're looking at these subsidies, if they mean something
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:23.040]   to you, you most likely would like to postpone Social Security or a pension if you could.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:28.320]   So let's say you had a pension that you could take it at 5560 or 65.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:34.240]   And you knew you were going to have to survive through ACA plans that you would be, you should
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.040]   really seriously look at delaying that pension and or Social Security as long as you can.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:44.140]   You also don't want to take withdrawals from your IRA or 401k type accounts, because those
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.440]   will count as ordinary income.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:52.080]   Again, if you're less than 59 and a half, there's a penalty for taking out of your 401k.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.120]   So you want to think about that too.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.420]   So the ideal way to do this is to have some post tax money that you can use.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:07.100]   And you still want to be able to set your income above the 138% federal poverty level.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:12.360]   Some people on the site have talked about timing things like for example, if you had
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.880]   large capital gains, that you may want to sell them before you sign up for the ACA for
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.240]   the year before.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.720]   And in many cases, you're working a lot at that point.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.200]   And you have high income at that point.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.920]   So your marginal rates could be much higher.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.320]   So you really need to work out a lot of different strategies.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.400]   Some people have even talked on the site about getting a home equity loan to tide you over
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:43.280]   to keep if you absolutely need money to survive, but you look at that premium tax credit say
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.460]   that's worth a lot, it might be cheaper to take a home equity line of credit to tide
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.560]   you through some of this time to keep the maximum premium.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.560]   I don't know if that's worth it.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:02.320]   But sometimes it's worth depending on what your coverage needs are.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:08.840]   If you had one patient with one spouse that had a lot of medical needs, it could be that
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:14.520]   it's better to put one patient on a much better plan, which what I mean by that is lower deductible
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.520]   load or lower out of pocket.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.600]   And then have the other person on a bronze plan with a very high deductible.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.640]   And you also have to think about the children, it could be that they better off from a cost
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.760]   point of view on the bronze plan.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.440]   So again, delay Social Security, spend post tax money, invest earnings in 401k that which
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:45.540]   will bring down any 401k individual 401k IRAs, those things will bring your income down.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:54.920]   Things like Roth conversions or Roth raises your income, reverse mortgages.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.400]   So this is the thing about different states are covered differently depending on whether
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.840]   they expanded Medicaid.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.680]   It's a little map of that.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.600]   Again, the Roth conversion, this is what a lot of people ask about, should I do Roth
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.760]   conversions or what's the subsidy worth?
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.800]   So you got to look at this Roth conversions also raise your income, which can raise your
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.320]   Medicare IRMA surcharges, so you got to kind of look at that too.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.600]   And everyone always asks, is there a model out there that takes care of this and we really
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:26.960]   haven't seen one.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   Here's the IRMA rate.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.320]   So I don't know much about this.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.880]   But apparently, if you have, let's say you had made over 500,000, you could be surcharged
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:45.160]   by $347 a month on your Medicare, Medicare premiums.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:50.440]   So if you're self employed, and you're forced to do this, a couple strategies would be to
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.120]   keep one spouse on an employer plan if that was possible.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:59.440]   Again, if you're if you're self employed, sometimes people have very wild variability
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.920]   in their income.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:05.780]   And there, I would just recommend you estimate on the low side, because you always true it
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.520]   up on your on your final tax return anyway.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:15.400]   If you were to have employees non spouse, you could do what Carol said, which is come
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:22.320]   up with a group plan could be very expensive, but it may give you the doctors you need.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:28.760]   So here's another issue that some people have in retirement, they would like to buy an RV
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.720]   and travel around all the states.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:35.540]   One of the things that would be very important if you're going to do that, is you would want
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.160]   to pick a state of residency if that was possible.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.400]   Let's say you sold your home and bought an RV, you would want to pick a state that would
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.880]   give you good insurance the way you'd like to get it and you'd like to have a national
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.480]   provider with a PPO plan.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:55.600]   So think about that.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.720]   This is again the limits under the eight and a half percent rule.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.640]   That's the idea that there's no more cliff.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:10.560]   And this was a couple little issues that happened in because of this, if you had estimated your
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   income very low, and you really do to pay back a lot of the premium subsidies, you don't
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:21.080]   have to pay them back because of this American Rescue Act, which is interesting because the
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:26.760]   people who decided to pay later, pay up front are kind of getting screwed on that.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:39.120]   Again, this is a one time that that rules a one time case for this year.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:43.200]   The other thing that can be very helpful is you can run your tax software if you need
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.400]   to calculate some of this stuff.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:52.040]   There's a lot of stipulations if you were unemployed during the year, and that would
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:57.040]   help your COBRA, as well as basically bring your income down.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   Hold on one second.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:07.080]   Jim, someone asked if you could show the previous slide again.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:13.220]   Which one would you like me to stop at?
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:17.520]   Show the previous slide to go back.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.480]   All right.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   The RV one.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:27.040]   No, I think the one you just had was the one that wanted this one.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.320]   Yeah, so they're going to come.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.880]   So I would like, you know, for most of us, you know, we're probably from the poll, it
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.200]   looked like people were between 50 and 70 on this call.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.260]   So we would look maybe in this column here.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:48.400]   So current monthly subsidy that you might have been getting before at $40,000 was $649.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:54.280]   With the new law that President Biden signed, it would go up to $766.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:58.760]   And the plan price would go down from $328 to $211.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.440]   And the lowest price plan would have jumped down from $212 to $95.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:08.920]   So some significant savings with this law.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:23.560]   I think we were I'm going to post these links into the chat right now, for anybody that
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:37.200]   needs them.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:49.280]   Okay, this is the let's go back to here.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.000]   So this is the subsidy reconciliation form 1095 a is anybody here fill this out?
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.660]   I know my wife has so this is the case, this is where you true up the income.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.160]   So if you just thought you were let's say you become self employed, you act very conservatively
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.800]   think you're going to have income of 40,000 or 20,000.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.980]   And you turn out to have this very successful business and you make $10 million.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:19.420]   This is where the premium tax credit gets fixed.
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:23.260]   This is some information about what they have to pay out this is kind of a combination between
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:29.600]   the premiums and the deductible and the total risk to the pool and what the insurance pays.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:37.940]   And it's how they determine the bronze silver.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.100]   It really doesn't affect the quality, you could still be in the same network have the
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.580]   same access to same doctors, but the person in the bronze plan is probably going to be
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:52.020]   paying less premium, but have a very large deductible versus the platinum plan, which
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:57.060]   has a very large premium, but a very low deductible.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.700]   So you really have to look at your health care and it changes over the years and new
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.680]   chronic conditions can occur.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.500]   So you may change your plan in the beginning of retirement, you might be a bronze person,
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.660]   sometimes you want to take the risk yourself.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.340]   And if you start having medical problems, I've kind of looked at them all and it's kind
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:18.180]   of a wash anyway, depending on if you're going to spend the money, you either spend it in
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.360]   premium or deductible either way, it seems like.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.920]   So again, platinum will have the highest premiums, gold, silver.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.780]   Now the good thing about silver you need to look at is it has the highest cost sharing
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:32.780]   reduction.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:39.140]   So the subsidies in the in the reductions in premium and out of pocket can be very good.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.260]   So you really want to compare everything to the silver plan really.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.140]   And the bronze plan typically have these high deductibles, typically where you want to look
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.520]   at HSAs if possible.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:54.540]   And typically, if you're more healthy, and you're not going to use it.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:00.460]   This is a little summary of the modified adjusted gross income because so you can see that the
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.320]   your gross income is wages, dividends, capital, this is kind of like the money that comes
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   in.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:13.580]   But if you look at the adjusted Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was the Maggie there.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:23.900]   You can see that the other calculation has things like subtracting alimony moving expenses.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.140]   Half of self employment tax was a little bit more complicated.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:34.720]   Again, taking your Aggie plus these things to get to your Maggie.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:41.500]   So again, self student loan interest, half the self unemployment, tuition expenses, contributions
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:49.420]   to IRAs, these things will tend to reduce it.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:04:17.660]   And I can tell you.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:47.260]   So, yeah, I'm going to stop there.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:05:07.060]   Thanks for watching.
